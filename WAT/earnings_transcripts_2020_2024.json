In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Water's Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years and I am happy to have him joining me on this morning's call. I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other. During today's call I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full-year operating results, as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full-year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives. Looking more closely at our topline results, first from a customer perspective, our largest market category Pharma was the primary growth in the quarter with 15% growth. Our Industrial market grew 5% while Academia and Government declined 15%. Now, to geography. On a constant currency basis sales in Asia were up 12% with China up 19%. Meanwhile sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4% and European sales grew at 6%. From a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew approximately 8% while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis. While still navigating the global pandemic we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10% while consumables business grew approximately 14% driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched premier columns which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market. LC instruments grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal Pharma year and budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative. Following large students release of the Arc HVAC system in the core HPLC market with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY Premier, our next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY Premier columns which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results. After a very strong third quarter mass spec sales are about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy which we saw with biomedical research. There was also a general softness at clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double-digits driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and ACQUITY A. Finally, to TA, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences including pharma and medical devices grew double-digits. Combined these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers. Looking now at our geographies, all major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double-digits. In the U.S. the growth was driven by Pharma which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. While Latin America continued to decline, it grew meaningfully relative to earlier in the year. Europe also experienced strong pharma performance partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based including strengthen in Big Pharma, large molecule customers, genetics and contract labs. China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth driven by continuing acceleration in Pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers including particularly strong growth at contact labs. India also continued to grow double-digits. In summary, overall in the fourth quarter we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India, all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full-year and academic and government declined 16%. Notably our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8% owed in part to strength in small molecules the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4% while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22% respectively. Geographically for the year Asia sales were down 4% with China sales down 8% sales in Americas were down 4% with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6% following first half declines of 9% and 3% respectively. Our China market grew in the second half up 11% reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year. Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we are putting into action are starting to contribute to growth. First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiatives, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce and lastly I will give you a BioAccord update. First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in two years, and our LC instrument win-loss was the highest it has been in three years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the ARC HPLC as well. Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we are making. Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com graphic is up double-digits driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn\u2019t a one-to-one relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel. In tandem with our e-commerce actions we've also announced our e-procurement platform on which we have expanded our coverage of customers leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-procurement growth indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters. Fourth, driving launch excellence, BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our development efforts and our specialty sales model has started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021. Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team we are encouraged to see Waters consumables expecting [ph] on QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We are also seeing an uptick in COVID driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the first quarter where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID related programs. In summary, as I wrap up with 2020 we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams have focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID related efforts. Meanwhile our base business is showing signs of recovery and our transformation is well underway. Turning to 2021, while the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021 which is based on three key factors. One, we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up led by our LC replacement initiative which we expect to increasingly contribute through performance. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike?\nMichael Silveira: Thank you, Udit and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported. Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter, while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year recurring revenue grew 3%, while instrument sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenues were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10%, as customers continued to reopen labs, catch-up on performance maintenance, see professional services in the paid visits. As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further, sales were weighted to Waters branded products and services grew 8% while sales of TA branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5% while TA system sales declined 4%. Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2% an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume and FX. On a full-year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. Moving down the fourth quarter P&L operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after. In the quarter and for the full year our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8% respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances. Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 40% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49, compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 last year. On a GAAP basis full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow capital deployment in our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020 free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020 free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operations and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle. In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable, day sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in sales into the prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity through a well structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $443 million and gap of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITA ratio of about 1.1 times at the end of the fourth quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remained consistent; invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a two-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases. As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdowns seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID related revenue in 2020, three quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021 including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth. But the quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021. The second half of 2021 will have to contend with the challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates the positive currency translations to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29%, based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID related cost actions, and disciplined expense controls. Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from a full year guidance are net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new five-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026, a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021, that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase programs and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Moving all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Mike. In summary, we're pleased with our resilience in the second half of 2020 and the strong finish to the year, which is a true testament to the determination of this team. Though the environment remains variable, pharma markets have shown resilience and our transformation program is already demonstrating results and contributing to growth. Despite the challenging environment, the progress we've made as an organization over the last five months is nothing short of extraordinary. I remain ever more confident in the team, our portfolio and our market position. There remains a lot of work to do, but we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to turn the business around. With that, we will begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey congrats on a good [indiscernible] year Udit. I guess when you look at the revenue guidance here, which shed the color on COVID [indiscernible]. I guess on a go forward basis when you think about some of the growth initiatives you guys were making, is Waters now 5% or 7% maybe perhaps you can talk about what the medium term outlook for the company?\nUdit Batra: Thank you. Thank you, Vijay. And first let me say I'm super pleased with how we've finished the year. Looking ahead, I think we've guided I think more prudently than not. I think we have, I would say, we expect - the basis of the guidance for the full year which is about 5% to 8% is continuing strength in pharma. And there are three factors, if they go better would tend towards the higher end of the guidance, both in short and the mid-term; first, recovery of the other markets beyond pharma. Second, continuing tailwind from COVID-19 programs where we've seen our par expecting. And third, even more stronger contribution from our turnaround program. So I think I would simply say the guidance is prudent and we see several triggers that should allow us to get on the higher end, if they turn in the right direction.\nVijay Kumar: Got you and one last quick follow up on margins, I know there's been some debate if you will on the margin reset for the company. I guess when you look at the, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think I heard 28% to 29% margins for fiscal 2021, is that's the new base and should Waters be expanding margins off of the new base?\nUdit Batra: So Vijay I think, I think you've been looking at it probably much too closely. It's actually rather simple. The cost actions that we have taken in 2020 come back into the base and then that should allow us to go from there further on. But Mike, did you want to provide more color on that?\nMichael Silveira: Sure, I could. So definitely our operating margins are being impacted by the normalization of those cost options that were put in place in the second quarter. As a result of that, the COVID-19 pandemic these costs were temporary, and they included furloughs and salary reductions, but they have been restored already and we're already seeing that benefit in the sales growth. So, it will put a drag on our 2021 operating margins, but as we return to growth and we return to more of a historical, geographic and product mix in future, we believe that our margins will get back to those historical levels and maybe we will expand if we can get a higher level of our guidance.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic guys. Thanks again on a nice print [ph] year.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Vijay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America, your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hey, good morning, couple of questions. I guess the first one, could you talk a little bit more about the LC cycle, and some of the benefits of premier? And specifically, I'm also just curious about what if your pharma and installed base is Alliance versus your various ACQUITY generations, and what's actually, potentially amenable to upgrade? I just maybe just trying to get some sense about where you are in the process of a potential replacement cycle in the scheme of things here?\nUdit Batra: Sure, some, in fact look, the LC replacement initiative, the one that I introduced in the call earlier, is off to a wonderful start. If you look at the HPLC to UPLC mix of our installed bases, I would say roughly 53% to 47% HPLC to UPLC. And in terms of dimensionalizing it, remember we talked about Alliance in particular instruments that are now on limited service, assuming there are about 8000 or so of them we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean, we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback. And I would say a couple of facts; one, Arc HPLC is of course helping quite a bit in the replacement, but what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win loss ratio that we've seen in over three years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative and we're seeing rather positive uptake. Second, you asked a question on premier, we launched our premier columns in Q4. These are especially designed for molecules that have affinity for metals, and we've designed a non-absorptive surface which increases the efficiency of the separation. And if you'd say, well what is the application, the application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even, it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments such as ACQUITY premiere, and that's set to launch on February 10. The pre-market works have been very, very good and I expect that to do just as well. So, I hope that gives you more clarity on LC, and also on premier.\nDerik De Bruin: Yes, no, I appreciate the detail and I mean it is very helpful. And just how should we think about the tax rate sort of beyond 2021?\nUdit Batra: Mike?\nMichael Silveira: Regarding to the 15% to 16%, we've obviously -- I mentioned that we actually have a new agreement in force so that will help maintain our current tax profile between 15% and 16%, but obviously with all the new tax legislations that could possibly come down the pike it would maybe a different story. We are looking at it. Obviously there's a rate increase from 21% in the U.S. to 27%. We estimate that the impact would be about a 1% increase in the future to our tax rate overall worldwide if that were to happen with that legislation in place.\nDerik De Bruin: Great, thank you very much. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Udit, I think, one of the questions we're all going to get is just on the sustainability of the instrument strength, in particular the LC strength, especially after last quarter you expected a moderation in the fourth quarter because you had talked about CapEx spending in 3Q. It sounds like you mentioned normal budget plus for kind of planned spending and the LC replacement initiative is a big driver. So why should we expect a moderation going forward on the instrument side if you're in early innings of the LC replacement cycle?\nUdit Batra: Yes look Tyscho, we are being prudent with what we are guiding at this stage, right? I mean, so if you just look at the, or let me start with the overall commentary and then I'll comment more on LC and the instrument replacement and the other initiatives in particular. Look, if you just look at how we've guided, we say look towards the end of the year we should and Waters has as you know underperformed in the last few years, we would want to reach market growth of above in the next 12 to 18 months and these initiatives will help us. Right? So if I just now break it down, if our initiatives do better than planned, if other end markets recover and we continue to see COVID tailwind, we believe that we will be on the higher end of the guide, and that should set us up very nicely for the future. As far as the LC instrument replacement cycle is concerned, we're in the early stages of the innings. I mean it's a good start, but it's a start all the same. I don't want us to get overconfident with one data point. I believe the execution is very good. We have a good feedback from our customers. I do believe, especially with Arc HPLC the launch of premier we will continue to see strength in LC, but I would still want to remain prudent. So as I said, it's one data point, it's a good data point, but I would not want to extrapolate just based on one data point at this stage.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then one other question we've gotten is a lot of the turnaround plan is on kind of a refocused selling effort, whether it's penetrating CLOs or pushing more of an attach rate or trying to drive the replacement cycles you alluded to. The feedback in the market over the last couple of years is your competitors are selling better products cheaper. Now you highlighted the ACQUITY premier, Arc and BioAccord. I'm just curious if you still think there's an innovation gap in the market or how you feel about the current suite of instruments as it stands today versus competition?\nUdit Batra: Yes, I think let's take it across the portfolio. Right? So I've had a chance to examine the portfolio. I would say again, if you remember the turnaround plan was the first focus is on the short term commercial momentum. I think you would agree that that gives us freedom to act. Then we get our processes and systems right and then we focus on the portfolio. So there will be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggests the following. First, if you just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with five new launches in 2019 alone, and we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our Tandem Quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res I feel good about. Of course there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start. And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about HPLC and premier, both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to re-imagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years, that programs went under okay. If I move on to the consumer goods side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side our ACQUITY columns in particular have been designed for large molecules and these were for proteins, for peptides, for oligos, and now with the launch of premier that even strengthens the position further. So across the portfolio on the instrument side, on the consumable side, and with service we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing, we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean there are of course, there are of course things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So, I think for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have we can fight pretty well.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, that's helpful. One quick one before I hop off, just on the share repurchase, I'm curious as to the kind of the thought process there Waters has been criticized in the past for buying back a lot of stock, especially as revenues are going along the way, I don't think you'd be penalized for reinvesting more. So just talk about that trade-off between people interested in maybe investing more. So just talk about that tradeoff between, big purchases and maybe investing more in business.\nUdit Batra: Yes, look, I mean, we and I would let my comment a bit more in a minute. But at the height at the high level, we've we don't feel that there is any limitation for us to invest. Look, I mean, we just want to take it one step at a time. I mean, Waters has industry leading margins, have superb cash flow. So there is incredible flexibility to invest. We simply want to make sure that we do it in the right way and in the right areas. Right? And again, coming back to the transformation program, the first focus is to get the sales momentum back which were off to a good start. I mean, one or two data points don't make a trend, so we'll keep at it. We'll focus on the processes and the systems. And then there'll be enough time to think about enhancing the portfolio, both organically and in organically. So there is no limitation on that front. As far as the share repurchase program is concerned, it's part of our overall capital allocation philosophy. It is a lever, but don't assume that, that's the only lever we have. Mike, do you want to comment on the priorities for a minute?\nMichael Silveira: Sure, I would just add that we do have a strong flexible balance sheet, but we also generate a ton of free cash flow. Certainly, we generate about 25% of each sales dollar that gets converted into free cash flow. But we can use that and obviously our debt capacity to both invest in growth, both organically and inorganically, but we can also return value to shareholders. We have -- our share repurchase program over the course of the years has been very beneficial to our shareholders. We bought back -- it's been in place for about 18 years now and we bought back close to $9 billion. So as we move forward through this year, certainly, we're still in a pandemic here and we'll evaluate how much and when we actually will buy during the course of the year. But again, it's about being flexible and we believe we do have that flexibility and strength to do a couple of different things with respect to capital.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is now open.\nDouglas Schenkel: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Udit, in recent discussions you acknowledged that Waters, over the last several quarters has in certain instances been losing market share. And we've talked about this being a function of strong competitors really targeting Waters for a long time and finally make some, making some progress, especially in disrupting typical replacement cycles, where you would kind of have the home field advantage in placing a replacement box. I'm just wondering, where do you think you are in the process of taking steps to reverse these trends? How much investment and time is required pursuant to the reversal? And then keeping in mind that it was a pretty strong quarter, should we put much weight on Q4 results in the context of assessing your progress with these efforts?.\nUdit Batra: Thanks. Thanks, Doug. Look, it's a good quarter. It's a strong start to our initiatives, and especially the LC initiative, which we've talked about a fair bit. The basic assumption is and as you mentioned, is that there is a replacement cycle and replacement cycle of our instruments in the past as I mean, we knew about it, and we've been at it for a while. But I think the focus that we have now and you'd say well, what are you doing differently? I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show, starts to pay dividends is that we're using we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels, to those exact customers and in addition, armed with Arc, Arc HPLC has a new product in addition to our value proposition with Premier, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with Premier, with our service offering, is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good and leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good. Now in terms of how you should think about it, in the future, I think I'd rather share the fact after we're done rather than speculating, but all I can say is the data points we have at this point in time look positive, both in terms of how the customers are receiving our value proposition and how they're targeting the customer. So I mean, in general I will remind you that Waters is an LC company, right? Any time we do something on LC, our whole team, our sales team, our service team gets super enthusiastic and we're seeing some of that in the results. So I\u2019ll stop there and of course happy to answer any follow ups.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay, that was super helpful Udit, thank you for that. And then I guess this has kind of been touched on in some of the earlier questions, but I still think it's worth revisiting. If we just think about what we've heard, in terms of some of the early updates from some of the other larger tools companies, they are significantly accelerating investment in the current environment, essentially taking the COVID-19 related windfalls and reinvesting a lot of that cash flow into growth initiatives. In response to that, do you see the need to increase investment to essentially help maintain your competitive position kind of building off of the last question? Or, do you think that's not necessary and not something that drove you to kind of be reactionary in terms of how you looked at your investment plan for 2021?\nUdit Batra: Thanks Doug. Again, a very perceptive question and look at from your view, you somehow answered your question in the last comment. I mean, we will not be reactionary to anything. I think, R&D and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development and Waters is a technology oriented company, so we will stay true to the problem solving that we have to do. Now to some facts. If you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads we're seeing very good uptake of those. In particular, as I mentioned earlier, in China we wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in Pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio and we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec. BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, QA/QC -- LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument in BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear roadmap in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well and that's very well funded. If I now turn to the LC side, I mean we've redoubled that effort on that front, both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side and it's a question of turning our dollars to the right programs, and there on the consumables, in particular, with the launch of Premier has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space and that should be, that is something that the market is I think looking forward to have a non-absorptive surface for full instruments. And there again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take Empower into the cloud and expand the applications there. And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product based innovation, but it's a service based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions especially when it comes to, I would say almost on a la carte cart service, if based on the utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well. So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular and we will not be shy in increasing that funding and you'll hear more about that as we go forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Arias: Good morning guys, thank you. Udit on the specialty selling efforts that you've kind of honed in on as a need? Can you just sort of share some thoughts on how we should think about the scale and the magnitude of that push? I mean is there a percentage of reps or users who from now that we might be thinking about is as focused on either a particular product or a particular application?\nUdit Batra: Sure. I use that as an example, as an example Dan when we were talking about BioAccord in particular. Right? I mean, products that require a deeper explanation, products that could benefit from our customers, our customers being coached on how to use it, how to develop methods on them. And for BioAccord in particular, and I'll just use that as an example, that's off to an excellent start. Right? So we have done specialty reps and we've created a specialty reps team and turned them towards specific customers, especially ones with large molecule and oligonucleotide applications. And they've gone in and developed methods for these customers. And in many cases, we have follow on orders as well. And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by several fold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look most of our reps have a technical training. And the reasons Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now, we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it. If it works more, we'll continue to expand that specialty field force for more complex applications and BioAccord is just a start. I hope that gives you a bit more clarity. I don't want to quantify the fraction of field force that have done specialty. We will basically it's a pilot that seems to be showing results and will continue to expand as there are larger number of customers and targets.\nDaniel Arias: Yep. Okay, that's helpful. Okay and then maybe just one on margins as it relates to product mix. When you look at the collective gross margin profile for this last tranche of new products that's been developed, BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, Arc HPLC, is there a different profile attached to that in aggregate relative to the rest of the portfolio, such that if you guys are successful, and we do see some new product acceleration there, we should think of that as a mix factor that works in your favor. And then along those lines, you have mentioned that there are some other new things that you have in the hopper, is there a conscious effort to design and add things to the portfolio that are at a higher level of profitability than, say the credit sensor platforms? Thanks.\nUdit Batra: Excellent, excellent questions. I mean, I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution. In general, look a simple way to think about it is, consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time instruments as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence you start to see better and better margins over time. So you start-off with a slightly lower margin with instruments and that goes up over time. And with consumables informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of Premier, more informatics solutions, better service, definitely gave a lift and instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins?\nMichael Silveira: Sure. Well, what I will add is that obviously, when the new product gets introduced, we don't have the advantage of taking costs out. So over time, over the next couple of years after a product is introduced, we're typically able to lower the cost to produce the product, which will help the margin significantly. Also, obviously, the more units that, we did alluded to that we push through the plant will also help margins. So the combination of those two generally improves, especially on the instrument side, as we move out from one to two years after we launch.\nUdit Batra: But in general, I mean, just to expound on your question earlier and give you something specific, in general, it's a good assumption that we are introducing products that have a higher margin profile than we have in the past. I think that's a reasonable assumption.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephen Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.\nStephen Willoughby: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple, maybe just one or two starting for Mike. Mike, I just want to double check that we heard you correctly as it relates to some of the guidance for the first quarter. Did you say that you expect a 15% benefit to EPS from FX in the first quarter?\nMichael Silveira: 15%.\nStephen Willoughby: Wow, okay. And then I guess\u2026\nMichael Silveira: Sorry, so to expand upon that, the number is very small, so power to dominate a little bit, so that's the - pressure to be impacted.\nStephen Willoughby: Okay, very good, thank you. Just Udit, two questions for you, then as it relates to sort of looking forward. One, how are you thinking about instrument growth versus, recurring growth in 2021? And maybe if you, if there's any comments on the strong 14% chemicals growth you saw in the fourth quarter, if that was, how sustainable that sort of growth is? And then the second question is just, you previously have made some comments about yourself seeing some of the largest orders in company history here recently. I was just wondering if you could provide any more color on, if that was something you think is a change or sustainable or it just happened to be kind of a one off here in the most recent couple of months?\nUdit Batra: Stephen, good afternoon. Thank you for both of those questions. First, on instrument growth versus recurring, you saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits, instruments were mid single digits. And I think, going forward also, I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean, we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well. If Pharma continues its trend and as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards, I think, rather than giving you ratios, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take off, I think of applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that. Right? So small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generics consumption, and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with Arc HPLC in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables and then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is, just to give you color that on both fronts there is reason to believe that that we should see some optimistic development. And on the consumable side for large molecules first, I mean, our ACQUITY columns for UPLC have been designed in particular for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. The Premier getting launched first as a column, the technologies is has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad based, if I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. And from our spec, as you already know, BioAccord and QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4, so very, very broad based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. Now, in terms of large orders, and to give you give you color on my comment on large orders. Previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and asked us to replace their full fleet. And that has resulted in some of the largest orders and this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color. On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to the 14%. So I don't know Mike, if you have any comments on that I don't know what that is referring to the chemicals go to 14%.\nMichael Silveira: I'm not sure either. Sorry?\nUdit Batra: Steve, I hope that gives you color.\nOperator: Thanks. And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi. Thanks Udit and first of all, congratulations. This is an impressive quarter and thanks for all the work that you've put in these few months here. So first one based on what you were saying here and correct me if I'm wrong, it appears to me that the China Pharma recurring revenue sales and especially columns and small molecules. And then services grew very strongly in the quarter. Obviously, you highlighted the growth in China. So wondering what has changed in your approach in China in terms of commercial execution or is it largely market driven growth that we are seeing from across the peers as well. So correct me if I'm wrong on any of those assumptions as to what I'm seeing. And in that light also were there any incentives in the fourth quarter that drove this growth in that geography?\nUdit Batra: So thanks for your question Puneet on China. Look, I mean they are extremely happy with the quarter. I mean, it grew slightly shy of 20% after I would say a very difficult first half of the year. And so we're very happy with the momentum. And largely led by pharma, both on the small molecule and large molecule side, and a very broad based growth across the portfolio, across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did the trooper well in especially in the Pharma segment, so I feel really good about that. In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words, LC at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. And we have not just a portfolio, but our service teams are state of the art. So I think having the organization focused on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right. So giving them Arc HPLC and Premier, to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative. Secondly, I'd also mentioned our CXO [ph] contract testing and contract research organization initiative, that's also done rather well in China, our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers, we've increased our penetration in contract testing organizations in the food segment. It's again, one data point, but it's a good data point. And I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much. But it's a good data point, that gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level. Now, as far as incentives are concerned, they're no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus, but giving the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think are the key success factors, I would point to\nBryan Brokmeier: And operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Dan Brennan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Brennan: Great, thank you. Thanks for that. Thanks for taking the question. I kind of hopped on late, but I was hoping. I know you spoke a lot about Asia and China, but I was hoping to dig in a little bit more there. If you don't mind could you just kind of break apart kind of China? Because there was a lot going on in the last couple years for what is there particularly on the food and the pharma side, which and I know you've addressed that a little bit, but can you just walk us through a little bit, how you think about the opportunity going forward for Waters in China may be somewhat of a strategic initiatives that you all have ongoing? I know you're talking about a bigger portion of the contract, research organization, but I'm just wondering if you can kind of maybe peel the onion a bit more on China for us.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Dan, very good question and China, look we talked a bit about in the past, about what had caused the slowdown, right. I mean, the slowdown was led by the food segment, but also a bit of a slowdown in pharma and our focus on pharma. So I again, let me break it down a bit across the different initiatives in big Pharma. We expect our focus with LC, with Arc HPLC, with the launch of Arc HPLC and Premier and the replacement initiative should give us good tailwinds in pharma going forward. Second, for the food segment, we have really focused on expanding our coverage for the contract testing organizations. You remember, I mentioned we were a little bit late in following that trend. The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And not only we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area. And then across clinical China is one of those markets that in the past we were very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China now talking at a bit of a higher level in the pharma industry in China. You - if you look at the latest five year plan, it calls for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use and today that number is around 20 between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So if you feel rather well placed with our portfolio with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food. And from a portfolio perspective Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China. So I feel very good from a portfolio perspective and from a commercial perspective on the basis set. But it's as I said, it's a good start. It's a start all the same. So we're a bit prudent about what we want, what we want to see in the future.\nOperator: And that was the final question.\nUdit Batra: Thank you very much. So as we conclude, thank you all for joining today. I want to thank our team for doing such a stellar job in the first, in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing the effort and the strength as we as we go forward, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters and we look forward to updating you on our progress on Q1 in the Q1, 2021 call. This is currently anticipated on May 5, 2021. Thank you and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Silveira",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit and good morning everyone. In the fourth quarter we recorded net sales of $787 million, an increase of approximately 7% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 3%, resulting in sales growth of 10% as reported. For the full year, sales declined about 2% in constant currency and as reported. Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 11% in the quarter, while instrument sales increased 4%. For the full year recurring revenue grew 3%, while instrument sales declined 9%. Chemistry revenues were up 14% in the quarter, driven by strong pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 10%, as customers continued to reopen labs, catch-up on performance maintenance, see professional services in the paid visits. As we noted last quarter, recurring sales were impacted by 2 additional calendar days in the quarter, which resulted in a slight increase in service revenue sales. Looking ahead, there are 5 additional calendar days in the first quarter and 6 fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. Breaking fourth quarter product sales down further, sales were weighted to Waters branded products and services grew 8% while sales of TA branded products and services declined 1%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 5% while TA system sales declined 4%. Now I'd like to comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.2% an increase compared to the 58.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to higher sales volume and FX. On a full-year basis, gross margin was 57.4% compared to 58% in the prior year on lower overall sales volumes in 2020. Moving down the fourth quarter P&L operating expenses increased by approximately 6% on a constant currency basis and 8% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to variable expenses related to the strong sales performance. For the year operating expenses were 1% lower before currency translation and flat after. In the quarter and for the full year our effective operating tax rate was 14.9% and 14.8% respectively, an increase from last year as the comparable period included some favorable discrete items. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower outstanding debt balances. Our average share count came in at 62.5 million shares, a reduction of approximately 3% or about 2 million shares lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. This is the result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 subsequent to which we paused our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 40% to $3.65 in comparison to the $3.20 last year. On a GAAP basis our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.49, compared to $3.12 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were up 1% at $9.05 per share versus $8.99 last year. On a GAAP basis full year earnings per share were $8.36 versus $8.69 in 2019. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow capital deployment in our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our fourth quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the fourth quarter of 2020 free cash flow grew 52% year-over-year to $240 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $19 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the fourth quarter this resulted in $0.30 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. For the full year in 2020 free cash flow generation was $726 million after funding $172 million of capital expenditures. This represents a 26% increase and $0.31 per dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Excluded from free cash flow was $70 million related to our investment in our Taunton chemistry operations and a $38 million transition tax payment related to the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost saving actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle. In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable, day sales outstanding came in at 70 days, down 7 days compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Inventories decreased by $16 million in sales into the prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity through a well structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short term investments of $443 million and gap of $1.4 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $913 million and a net debt-to-EBITA ratio of about 1.1 times at the end of the fourth quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remained consistent; invest for growth, balance sheet strength and flexibility and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. As such, our Board of Directors has approved a two-year extension of our January 2019 share repurchase authorization that was set to expire last month. As of today, we have $1.5 billion remains available under the program for share repurchases. As we look forward to the year ahead, I'd like to provide some broader context on our thoughts for 2021. The business environment remains uncertain, and we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. We expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Our outlook does not anticipate a return of lockdowns seen in 2020. We had a 1% tailwind from COVID related revenue in 2020, three quarters of which was in the second half of the year. We expect a similar revenue impact in 2021 including a 1% to 2% growth tailwind in Q1. We anticipate the first half growth tailwind will moderate through the remainder of the year. Improved execution on our near term growth initiatives contributed to our fourth quarter growth. But the quarter also benefited from capital spending that was delayed from the first half into the second half of the year, which we don't expect to continue in 2021. The second half of 2021 will have to contend with the challenging comp resulting from a revenue shift that took place in 2020. These dynamics support full year 2021 guidance for constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8%. At current rates the positive currency translations to 2021 sales growth is expected to be 1 to 2 percentage points. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 57.5% to 58.5%. Every year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of 28% to 29%, based on a combination of growth investments, normalization of COVID related cost actions, and disciplined expense controls. Moving now below the operating income line. Other key assumptions from a full year guidance are net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, a full year tax rate of between 15% and 16%, which includes our new five-year tax agreement with Singapore that will expire in March 2026, a restart of our share repurchase program in 2021, that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61 million to 61.5 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate share repurchase programs and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Moving all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are projected in the range of $9.32 to $9.57, which assumes a positive currency impact on full year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. Looking at the first quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to increase first quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.60. At current rates the positive currency impact on first quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 15 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Sure, I could. So definitely our operating margins are being impacted by the normalization of those cost options that were put in place in the second quarter. As a result of that, the COVID-19 pandemic these costs were temporary, and they included furloughs and salary reductions, but they have been restored already and we're already seeing that benefit in the sales growth. So, it will put a drag on our 2021 operating margins, but as we return to growth and we return to more of a historical, geographic and product mix in future, we believe that our margins will get back to those historical levels and maybe we will expand if we can get a higher level of our guidance. Regarding to the 15% to 16%, we've obviously -- I mentioned that we actually have a new agreement in force so that will help maintain our current tax profile between 15% and 16%, but obviously with all the new tax legislations that could possibly come down the pike it would maybe a different story. We are looking at it. Obviously there's a rate increase from 21% in the U.S. to 27%. We estimate that the impact would be about a 1% increase in the future to our tax rate overall worldwide if that were to happen with that legislation in place. Sure, I would just add that we do have a strong flexible balance sheet, but we also generate a ton of free cash flow. Certainly, we generate about 25% of each sales dollar that gets converted into free cash flow. But we can use that and obviously our debt capacity to both invest in growth, both organically and inorganically, but we can also return value to shareholders. We have -- our share repurchase program over the course of the years has been very beneficial to our shareholders. We bought back -- it's been in place for about 18 years now and we bought back close to $9 billion. So as we move forward through this year, certainly, we're still in a pandemic here and we'll evaluate how much and when we actually will buy during the course of the year. But again, it's about being flexible and we believe we do have that flexibility and strength to do a couple of different things with respect to capital. Sure. Well, what I will add is that obviously, when the new product gets introduced, we don't have the advantage of taking costs out. So over time, over the next couple of years after a product is introduced, we're typically able to lower the cost to produce the product, which will help the margin significantly. Also, obviously, the more units that, we did alluded to that we push through the plant will also help margins. So the combination of those two generally improves, especially on the instrument side, as we move out from one to two years after we launch. 15%. Sorry, so to expand upon that, the number is very small, so power to dominate a little bit, so that's the - pressure to be impacted. I'm not sure either. Sorry?"

            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Water's Vice President, Controller and Interim CFO. Some of you may already know Mike who has been a part of the Waters finance organization for 16 years and I am happy to have him joining me on this morning's call. I would like to start by thanking our employees around the globe for their hard work and dedication through what has been an extraordinarily difficult year. It is one that has brought significant change and sacrifice. From navigating the pandemic and resulting short-term cost saving initiatives earlier this year to changes in leadership, the Waters team has responded with drive, determination and an indomitable spirit. I am impressed by and grateful for our team's resilience and commitment to our customers and to each other. During today's call I will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full-year operating results, as well as an update on the stabilization that we have seen in the LC market and a few factors influencing our thinking for 2021. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our first quarter and full-year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Briefly reviewing our operating results for the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% as reported, 7% on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 14%. For the full year revenue declined 2% and adjusted earnings per share was up 1%. This strong finish to the end of a challenging year was driven by the pharmaceutical market improvement, capital spending recovery in the second half of the year, strong execution and early contributions from our near-term growth initiatives. Looking more closely at our topline results, first from a customer perspective, our largest market category Pharma was the primary growth in the quarter with 15% growth. Our Industrial market grew 5% while Academia and Government declined 15%. Now, to geography. On a constant currency basis sales in Asia were up 12% with China up 19%. Meanwhile sales in the Americas grew 3% with the U.S. growing 4% and European sales grew at 6%. From a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew approximately 8% while TA declined by around 1% on a constant currency basis. While still navigating the global pandemic we are seeing clear signs of improving customer activity, positive growth trends in our recurring revenues and an evidence of stabilization in LC instrument demand. Services grew 10% while consumables business grew approximately 14% driven largely by global pharma strength, including sales of our recently launched premier columns which performed exceedingly well in the first quarter on the market. LC instruments grew across most of our major geographies with high single-digit growth. This improvement in capital equipment purchasing reflects the combination of the return of some of the planned capital spending that was delayed from the first half of the year, a normal Pharma year and budget flush and early contributions from our LC replacement initiative. Following large students release of the Arc HVAC system in the core HPLC market with a particular focus on the small molecule development and QA/QC space, we look forward to the continued expansion of our liquid chromatography portfolio. On February 10, we will launch ACQUITY Premier, our next-generation UPLC system that offers customers an extraordinary breakthrough in efficiency, sensitivity and overall capability. This new system will benefit both large and small molecule discovery and development as well as biomedical research. This new system has even more profound benefits when paired with our ACQUITY Premier columns which I mentioned earlier and were launched in the fourth quarter. The combined solution will alleviate nonspecific binding absorption losses and provide a significant leap forward with enhanced reproducibility, reduced passivation and an increased confidence in analytical results. After a very strong third quarter mass spec sales are about flat in Q4. As you know, the mass spec business can be lumpy which we saw with biomedical research. There was also a general softness at clinical diagnostics as budgets were diverted to COVID-19 testing. Notably, however, mass spec sales to pharma customers grew double-digits driven by the strong double-digit growth of both BioAccord and ACQUITY A. Finally, to TA, revenues declined low single digits, which was much improved from earlier in the year. We saw the core thermal business start to pick up, driven by market improvement in Asia. In particular, life sciences including pharma and medical devices grew double-digits. Combined these comprised approximately 10% to 15% of TA's total revenues. However, this was not enough to offset declines from TA's industrial customers. Looking now at our geographies, all major regions grew. The Americas grew low single digits, Europe grew mid-single digits, and Asia grew double-digits. In the U.S. the growth was driven by Pharma which was partially offset by declines in material science, environmental and academic and government. While Latin America continued to decline, it grew meaningfully relative to earlier in the year. Europe also experienced strong pharma performance partially offset by material science, food and academic and government. In both U.S. and Europe, pharma growth was broad-based including strengthen in Big Pharma, large molecule customers, genetics and contract labs. China had an impressive quarter with strong double-digit growth driven by continuing acceleration in Pharma as well as strong environmental growth. The pharma growth was driven by both small and large molecule customers including particularly strong growth at contact labs. India also continued to grow double-digits. In summary, overall in the fourth quarter we saw further relative strength in the market and benefited from strong year end spending trends. Now for the year, our pharmaceutical market category achieved 1% growth with the U.S., Europe and India, all seeing positive growth. Industrial declined 3% for the full-year and academic and government declined 16%. Notably our pharma market category grew 10% in the second half compared to the first half decline of 8% owed in part to strength in small molecules the industry recovered from lockdowns. Industrial also grew in the second half at 4% while academic and government declined 12% compared to the first half declines of 10% and 22% respectively. Geographically for the year Asia sales were down 4% with China sales down 8% sales in Americas were down 4% with the U.S. down 2%. Europe sales were up 2%. Notably all our major geographies grew in the second half of the year with the U.S. up 4% and Europe up 6% following first half declines of 9% and 3% respectively. Our China market grew in the second half up 11% reversing much of its sharp 31% decline in the first half of the year. Now I would like to share some of the progress we've made in our transformation program as several of the initiatives we are putting into action are starting to contribute to growth. First, I will talk about our instrument replacement initiatives, then our progress in contract lab expansion, followed by e-commerce and lastly I will give you a BioAccord update. First, as it relates to our instrument replacement initiative, which is the most advanced initiative underway, we delivered our first quarterly LC instrument revenue growth in two years, and our LC instrument win-loss was the highest it has been in three years. Initial customer feedback has been very positive on the ARC HPLC as well. Second, as part of our contract lab expansion initiative, we have made important progress in targeting this high growth customer group. We have contacted a number of customers globally, particularly in China and have strengthened our value proposition with expanded alternative revenue and service offerings which have been well received by this segment. It is still early days, but we're pleased with the progress we are making. Third, our e-commerce initiative is still in the early stages, but waters.com graphic is up double-digits driven by search engine optimization and paid search. While there isn't a one-to-one relationship between traffic and revenue, increased traffic is an important first step in driving revenue growth through the e-commerce channel. In tandem with our e-commerce actions we've also announced our e-procurement platform on which we have expanded our coverage of customers leveraging this channel. This supported strong e-procurement growth indicating that it's now easier to work with Waters. Fourth, driving launch excellence, BioAccord sales exceeded expectations in the quarter as our development efforts and our specialty sales model has started to take effect, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Many customers are increasingly adopting BioAccord for manufacturing and several have placed follow-on orders. Once we get BioAccord applications on an enterprise software platform, we believe we will be seeing more follow-on orders. More importantly, customer activity continues to be encouraging, which makes us optimistic about 2021. Lastly, I'd like to highlight our efforts to help mitigate the public health crisis. In addition to the significant efforts by our innovation response team we are encouraged to see Waters consumables expecting [ph] on QA/QC methods for COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We are also seeing an uptick in COVID driven demand for our instruments and consumables. This peaked in the first quarter where COVID revenues contributed an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points to the growth driven by those pharmaceutical customers developing COVID vaccines and therapeutics. We saw meaningfully higher growth than manufacturers that don't have COVID related programs. In summary, as I wrap up with 2020 we've done a great job at keeping our employees safe and our operations running. Our teams have focused not only on getting products out the door, but we have also assisted our customers engaged in COVID related efforts. Meanwhile our base business is showing signs of recovery and our transformation is well underway. Turning to 2021, while the business environment remains uncertain, we look forward to building on the fourth quarter momentum. Mike will provide further details on our outlook for 2021 which is based on three key factors. One, we are assuming a gradual improvement in customer activity led by the pharma market. Two, we expect all major geographies to perform better than they did in 2020 led by growth in China. Lastly, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp up led by our LC replacement initiative which we expect to increasingly contribute through performance. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and 2020 financials and our outlook for 2021. Mike? Thank you, Mike. In summary, we're pleased with our resilience in the second half of 2020 and the strong finish to the year, which is a true testament to the determination of this team. Though the environment remains variable, pharma markets have shown resilience and our transformation program is already demonstrating results and contributing to growth. Despite the challenging environment, the progress we've made as an organization over the last five months is nothing short of extraordinary. I remain ever more confident in the team, our portfolio and our market position. There remains a lot of work to do, but we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to turn the business around. With that, we will begin the Q&A session. Operator? Thank you. Thank you, Vijay. And first let me say I'm super pleased with how we've finished the year. Looking ahead, I think we've guided I think more prudently than not. I think we have, I would say, we expect - the basis of the guidance for the full year which is about 5% to 8% is continuing strength in pharma. And there are three factors, if they go better would tend towards the higher end of the guidance, both in short and the mid-term; first, recovery of the other markets beyond pharma. Second, continuing tailwind from COVID-19 programs where we've seen our par expecting. And third, even more stronger contribution from our turnaround program. So I think I would simply say the guidance is prudent and we see several triggers that should allow us to get on the higher end, if they turn in the right direction. So Vijay I think, I think you've been looking at it probably much too closely. It's actually rather simple. The cost actions that we have taken in 2020 come back into the base and then that should allow us to go from there further on. But Mike, did you want to provide more color on that? Thank you, Vijay. Sure, some, in fact look, the LC replacement initiative, the one that I introduced in the call earlier, is off to a wonderful start. If you look at the HPLC to UPLC mix of our installed bases, I would say roughly 53% to 47% HPLC to UPLC. And in terms of dimensionalizing it, remember we talked about Alliance in particular instruments that are now on limited service, assuming there are about 8000 or so of them we expect 10% to 15% of those to be replaced. The initiative in itself is off to an excellent start. I mean, we've contacted over 60% of those customers already, received rather positive feedback. And I would say a couple of facts; one, Arc HPLC is of course helping quite a bit in the replacement, but what we've seen in Q4 is the highest win loss ratio that we've seen in over three years for our LC instruments. So this bodes well for the initiative and we're seeing rather positive uptake. Second, you asked a question on premier, we launched our premier columns in Q4. These are especially designed for molecules that have affinity for metals, and we've designed a non-absorptive surface which increases the efficiency of the separation. And if you'd say, well what is the application, the application is actually squarely targeted towards larger molecules and oligonucleotides, and the uptake has been excellent. And I would say it's even, it will get even more interesting when we take the technology and implement it across our UPLC instruments such as ACQUITY premiere, and that's set to launch on February 10. The pre-market works have been very, very good and I expect that to do just as well. So, I hope that gives you more clarity on LC, and also on premier. Mike? Yes look Tyscho, we are being prudent with what we are guiding at this stage, right? I mean, so if you just look at the, or let me start with the overall commentary and then I'll comment more on LC and the instrument replacement and the other initiatives in particular. Look, if you just look at how we've guided, we say look towards the end of the year we should and Waters has as you know underperformed in the last few years, we would want to reach market growth of above in the next 12 to 18 months and these initiatives will help us. Right? So if I just now break it down, if our initiatives do better than planned, if other end markets recover and we continue to see COVID tailwind, we believe that we will be on the higher end of the guide, and that should set us up very nicely for the future. As far as the LC instrument replacement cycle is concerned, we're in the early stages of the innings. I mean it's a good start, but it's a start all the same. I don't want us to get overconfident with one data point. I believe the execution is very good. We have a good feedback from our customers. I do believe, especially with Arc HPLC the launch of premier we will continue to see strength in LC, but I would still want to remain prudent. So as I said, it's one data point, it's a good data point, but I would not want to extrapolate just based on one data point at this stage. Yes, I think let's take it across the portfolio. Right? So I've had a chance to examine the portfolio. I would say again, if you remember the turnaround plan was the first focus is on the short term commercial momentum. I think you would agree that that gives us freedom to act. Then we get our processes and systems right and then we focus on the portfolio. So there will be more to say about the portfolio in the future, but the current assessment suggests the following. First, if you just look at the instrument portfolio, our mass spec portfolio has been completely refreshed with five new launches in 2019 alone, and we've talked a lot about BioAccord, but also our Tandem Quad portfolio with the Xevo line has done quite well, especially if you look at the uptake for traditional Chinese medicine in China and small molecule organic testing with that portfolio. So the mass spec portfolio, both on tandem quad and high res I feel good about. Of course there's always more to do, but it's a very, very good start. And if I move to LC, we talked a bit about HPLC and premier, both are significant steps forward for our portfolio. And as I mentioned earlier, we are thinking of how to re-imagine the LC instrument, especially in the QA/QC space and there'll be more to say about that in the next few years, that programs went under okay. If I move on to the consumer goods side, both for small and large molecule pharma, our portfolio is very well set. I won't speak much about the small molecule. I think that is well understood. But on the large molecule side our ACQUITY columns in particular have been designed for large molecules and these were for proteins, for peptides, for oligos, and now with the launch of premier that even strengthens the position further. So across the portfolio on the instrument side, on the consumable side, and with service we continue to look for better options. I believe we're doing, we've done a lot. We're doing a fair bit to continue to refresh the portfolio. And going forward, I mean there are of course, there are of course things to do to enhance the portfolio, but I don't feel for a second that we are disadvantaged versus competition in the market. So, I think for the short term, I believe with the hand that we have we can fight pretty well. Yes, look, I mean, we and I would let my comment a bit more in a minute. But at the height at the high level, we've we don't feel that there is any limitation for us to invest. Look, I mean, we just want to take it one step at a time. I mean, Waters has industry leading margins, have superb cash flow. So there is incredible flexibility to invest. We simply want to make sure that we do it in the right way and in the right areas. Right? And again, coming back to the transformation program, the first focus is to get the sales momentum back which were off to a good start. I mean, one or two data points don't make a trend, so we'll keep at it. We'll focus on the processes and the systems. And then there'll be enough time to think about enhancing the portfolio, both organically and in organically. So there is no limitation on that front. As far as the share repurchase program is concerned, it's part of our overall capital allocation philosophy. It is a lever, but don't assume that, that's the only lever we have. Mike, do you want to comment on the priorities for a minute? Thanks. Thanks, Doug. Look, it's a good quarter. It's a strong start to our initiatives, and especially the LC initiative, which we've talked about a fair bit. The basic assumption is and as you mentioned, is that there is a replacement cycle and replacement cycle of our instruments in the past as I mean, we knew about it, and we've been at it for a while. But I think the focus that we have now and you'd say well, what are you doing differently? I think what we're doing differently from the past, which starts to show, starts to pay dividends is that we're using we know exactly where these instruments are. We've taken a look at the database. We've targeted our reps to those exact channels, to those exact customers and in addition, armed with Arc, Arc HPLC has a new product in addition to our value proposition with Premier, we feel our full portfolio with the LC, with Premier, with our service offering, is off to a good start in this replacement cycle. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and I won't speculate too much on the future, but this data point looks good and leading indicators in terms of orders also look rather good. Now in terms of how you should think about it, in the future, I think I'd rather share the fact after we're done rather than speculating, but all I can say is the data points we have at this point in time look positive, both in terms of how the customers are receiving our value proposition and how they're targeting the customer. So I mean, in general I will remind you that Waters is an LC company, right? Any time we do something on LC, our whole team, our sales team, our service team gets super enthusiastic and we're seeing some of that in the results. So I'll stop there and of course happy to answer any follow ups. Thanks Doug. Again, a very perceptive question and look at from your view, you somehow answered your question in the last comment. I mean, we will not be reactionary to anything. I think, R&D and having been a researcher myself for a good part of my career, I mean, we want to focus on fundamentals. We want to focus on technology development and Waters is a technology oriented company, so we will stay true to the problem solving that we have to do. Now to some facts. If you look at the R&D productivity in recent times, the mass spec portfolio has been completely renewed, both on the high res side as well as on the tandem quad side. And to provide you more color on the tandem quads we're seeing very good uptake of those. In particular, as I mentioned earlier, in China we wanted to continue to work on our software on those tandem quads to even increase the uptake in Pharma DMPK sort of areas as well. So I feel we have done a good job in refreshing the mass spec portfolio and we also know what we need to get done specifically, and we are funding those programs very well, especially on the informatics side for mass spec. BioAccord is another case in point. I mean, as you know, QA/QC -- LC-MS and QA/QC is somehow the holy grail in the industry to be able to take large molecules to the same place where small molecules are in release testing. And we have a robust and reliable instrument in BioAccord, which is starting to see very good uptake. And we have a really clear roadmap in increasing applications and improving the software on that front as well and that's very well funded. If I now turn to the LC side, I mean we've redoubled that effort on that front, both on the commercial side, but also on the R&D side and it's a question of turning our dollars to the right programs, and there on the consumables, in particular, with the launch of Premier has been received very well in the market. We're expanding that technology into our full instrument space and that should be, that is something that the market is I think looking forward to have a non-absorptive surface for full instruments. And there again, there is a strong effort on the software side as well to take Empower into the cloud and expand the applications there. And then finally, if I turn to the service side, there we are always looking at better value propositions. And here, it's not necessarily a product based innovation, but it's a service based innovation. Many of our customers are asking us for more flexible value propositions especially when it comes to, I would say almost on a la carte cart service, if based on the utilization, and we are offering those value propositions as well. So I've gone on long, but just to give you a flavor that the R&D programs are based on specifics and not what appears to be popular and we will not be shy in increasing that funding and you'll hear more about that as we go forward. Sure. I use that as an example, as an example Dan when we were talking about BioAccord in particular. Right? I mean, products that require a deeper explanation, products that could benefit from our customers, our customers being coached on how to use it, how to develop methods on them. And for BioAccord in particular, and I'll just use that as an example, that's off to an excellent start. Right? So we have done specialty reps and we've created a specialty reps team and turned them towards specific customers, especially ones with large molecule and oligonucleotide applications. And they've gone in and developed methods for these customers. And in many cases, we have follow on orders as well. And to just come back to the facts, I mean, for BioAccord Q4 was the best quarter since its launch by several fold. So we think this approach is working. Now in terms of what fraction of the total field force is specialty versus generalist, look most of our reps have a technical training. And the reasons Waters has been successful in the market for so long is because of our because of our technical capabilities and how we are able to partner with our customers. And now, we basically trained a few of them on specific methods. I would say we will continue to expand it. If it works more, we'll continue to expand that specialty field force for more complex applications and BioAccord is just a start. I hope that gives you a bit more clarity. I don't want to quantify the fraction of field force that have done specialty. We will basically it's a pilot that seems to be showing results and will continue to expand as there are larger number of customers and targets. Excellent, excellent questions. I mean, I'll give you a general answer to your second question and then let Mike give you a bit of specifics on how we're seeing the margin evolution. In general, look a simple way to think about it is, consumables and recurring revenues have a bit of a higher margin than instruments. And over time instruments as the demand rises, you can see more leverage in the P&L and you have higher units. So hence you start to see better and better margins over time. So you start-off with a slightly lower margin with instruments and that goes up over time. And with consumables informatics, you already see a nice starting point. And so launch of Premier, more informatics solutions, better service, definitely gave a lift and instruments at the beginning might start off at a lower starting point, but then would go up rather rapidly as the demand goes up and we're seeing that already in many of our platforms. So Mike, do you want to comment a bit more on the margins and the evolution, especially on the gross margins? But in general, I mean, just to expound on your question earlier and give you something specific, in general, it's a good assumption that we are introducing products that have a higher margin profile than we have in the past. I think that's a reasonable assumption. Stephen, good afternoon. Thank you for both of those questions. First, on instrument growth versus recurring, you saw in the fourth quarter that recurring revenues were double digits, instruments were mid single digits. And I think, going forward also, I mean, if you just think through what we are thinking, what we are hoping to see in the future, I mean, we expect that pharma continues, and you should see a similar sort of mix going forward as well. If Pharma continues its trend and as other end markets recover, we expect a bit of upside to it. And if you just turn a bit towards, I think, rather than giving you ratios, let me give you a bit of specifics on how one could think about it. If you just take off, I think of applications in pharma for both small and large molecules, and let me just give you a bit of the portfolio that goes towards that. Right? So small molecules, I mean, as that rises, especially as generics consumption, and products for COVID, especially therapeutics, small molecule therapeutics rise, we see our LC portfolio with Arc HPLC in particular, going up. Then if you turn to large molecules, you can start with consumables and then the reason I'm giving you the specifics is, just to give you color that on both fronts there is reason to believe that that we should see some optimistic development. And on the consumable side for large molecules first, I mean, our ACQUITY columns for UPLC have been designed in particular for large molecules. This starts with proteins, with peptides, glycans and also oligos. The Premier getting launched first as a column, the technologies is has got very good traction, especially for oligonucleotide applications and now it goes into the instrument space. So it's rather broad based, if I just take the LC example, both on the UPLC side and the HPLC side. And from our spec, as you already know, BioAccord and QDa have done pretty well for large molecule applications in Q4, so very, very broad based. I would not speculate on one or the other, but I would say, Q4 gives you a good indication of what we should see even going forward, if not better. Now, in terms of large orders, and to give you give you color on my comment on large orders. Previously, you see with the LC replacement initiatives we've had some customers come in and asked us to replace their full fleet. And that has resulted in some of the largest orders and this is why I'm rather optimistic about this initiative. So that gives you more color. On the chemicals piece, I'm not sure what you're referring to the 14%. So I don't know Mike, if you have any comments on that I don't know what that is referring to the chemicals go to 14%. Steve, I hope that gives you color. So thanks for your question Puneet on China. Look, I mean they are extremely happy with the quarter. I mean, it grew slightly shy of 20% after I would say a very difficult first half of the year. And so we're very happy with the momentum. And largely led by pharma, both on the small molecule and large molecule side, and a very broad based growth across the portfolio, across instruments, both mass spec as well as LC consumables and service, especially recurring revenues did the trooper well in especially in the Pharma segment, so I feel really good about that. In terms of changes, I mean, it goes back to what we talked about earlier, really focusing the field on what matters. And as I mentioned earlier, as soon as we utter the words, LC at Waters, we have a genuine enthusiasm across the organization. And we have not just a portfolio, but our service teams are state of the art. So I think having the organization focused on LC, giving them Arc HPLC as a new product, and it was especially designed for China, in particular, right. So giving them Arc HPLC and Premier, to go out and have these conversations with the LC customers has been a terrific initiative. Secondly, I'd also mentioned our CXO [ph] contract testing and contract research organization initiative, that's also done rather well in China, our team has gone out to meet contract manufacturers, we've increased our penetration in contract testing organizations in the food segment. It's again, one data point, but it's a good data point. And I'm reluctant to start extrapolating too much. But it's a good data point, that gives us confidence that activity is at a higher level. Now, as far as incentives are concerned, they're no different than they have been in the past. It's just a question of focus, but giving the team's new products, giving them clarity on which customers to go after and working with them to succeed, I think are the key success factors, I would point to Sure. Dan, very good question and China, look we talked a bit about in the past, about what had caused the slowdown, right. I mean, the slowdown was led by the food segment, but also a bit of a slowdown in pharma and our focus on pharma. So I again, let me break it down a bit across the different initiatives in big Pharma. We expect our focus with LC, with Arc HPLC, with the launch of Arc HPLC and Premier and the replacement initiative should give us good tailwinds in pharma going forward. Second, for the food segment, we have really focused on expanding our coverage for the contract testing organizations. You remember, I mentioned we were a little bit late in following that trend. The team has gone and reached out to each and every one of those customers. And not only we have to make sure that our value propositions work before we start to see meaningful growth in that area. And then across clinical China is one of those markets that in the past we were very well in that segment. I mean, this year, we've seen some headwinds especially due to the diversion towards COVID-19 testing. So I expect that to come back. So across the board, we see some good opportunities in China now talking at a bit of a higher level in the pharma industry in China. You - if you look at the latest five year plan, it calls for having roughly 45% or so of the production for biopharmaceuticals occurring locally in China for China use and today that number is around 20 between 20% and 25%. So there's a commitment in the Chinese government and the Chinese economy to increase pharma consumption. So if you feel rather well placed with our portfolio with our commercial focus to go after the opportunity in pharma as well as in food. And from a portfolio perspective Arc HPLC was specifically designed for the Chinese LC market. Our tandem quad portfolio is doing rather well for traditional Chinese medicine and food testing and environmental testing in China. So I feel very good from a portfolio perspective and from a commercial perspective on the basis set. But it's as I said, it's a good start. It's a start all the same. So we're a bit prudent about what we want, what we want to see in the future. Thank you very much. So as we conclude, thank you all for joining today. I want to thank our team for doing such a stellar job in the first, in the fourth quarter and we're looking forward to continuing the effort and the strength as we as we go forward, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters and we look forward to updating you on our progress on Q1 in the Q1, 2021 call. This is currently anticipated on May 5, 2021. Thank you and have a great day."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn over the call to Mr. Bryan Brokmeier. Sir, you may begin.\nBryan Brokmeier: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide commentary on potential market and business conditions the company anticipates for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. We caution you that all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 in Part I under the caption Risk Factors, and in our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2020 in Part I under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC, as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts, or as otherwise required by law. The next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for February 2, 2021. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled, Reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted Non-GAAP Financials, included in this morning's press release. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin with the content, let me say I'm honored and thankful for the opportunity to lead Waters and work with such a talented and dedicated team. It has been a very busy eight weeks. Along with Bryan, our CFO, Sherry Buck, is joining me in today's call. During the call, I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results and then share some of my early impressions of the company and the opportunities that I see. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our fourth quarter financial outlook. We will then open up the phone to take your questions. Let's start with the third quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to stay close to our customers. We've seen a cautious, return to work by our customers, and this has reflected in our results. After a steep decline in the second quarter, third quarter sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 1%. First, from a customer perspective, our largest segment, pharma, was the primary growth driver in the quarter, with 4% organic growth, followed by industrial, which grew 3% and academic and government, which declined 7%. From a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew 3% organically, while TA declined by 8% on a constant currency basis. Improving access to labs, especially in pharma, continue to help drive growth in the recurring revenues. Services grew 4%, while consumables business grew approximately 7% organically, driven largely by pharma. Consumables remain a growth area for us. In fact, earlier this month, we introduced our ACQUITY premier columns, which reduced variability, risks and safe time when analyzing metal loving analytes ranging from oligonucleotides, peptides, glycans and phospholipids. The chemistry on the surface reduces unwanted analytes to surface interactions to produce real improvements in sensitivity, peak shape and recovery. The third quarter was strong for our mass spec systems with double-digit growth. We were encouraged by the demand of our high-resolution mass spec systems in pharma and biomedical research, particularly in the US and Europe, and the demand for our Tandem Quad systems in food safety in China. BioAccord also grew nicely in the quarter. However, it still does not represent a material portion of our revenue. With its simplicity and dedicated workflows in Peptide Mapping, glycan analysis, intact mass and oligonucleotide analysis, we believe it is the right instrument to bring LC-MS into the manufacturing in QA/QC space. I have spent time with several of our customers who are using BioAccord instruments and many of them highlighted its ease of use and a robust feature set that can be utilized across multiple lab applications. So I think BioAccord has a good future, but I also think it will take longer than originally anticipated to significantly impact our core growth. This is a dynamic Waters has seen with prior new product launches, such as Acuity, which took almost four years to reach its peak sales. LC instruments also saw a better quarter after double-digit declines in the first half of the year, with a modest decline in Q3. Some of this improvement can be directly attributed to Arc HPLC, which was launched in June. Finally, to TA, revenues continue to decline in the high single digits, due to constrained capital spending at our industrial customers. Pharma and electronics revenue saw a nice double-digit increase, but this was not enough to offset the industrial declines. Turning to our key geographies. Both the Americas and Europe grew mid-single digits, while Asia was flat. In the US, the growth was driven by pharma, food and academia, partially offset by declines in material science and clinical. We saw especially strong engage with customers who are assisting the fight against the pandemic. Latin America remained soft, mostly due to the continued impact of closures due to COVID-19. Europe also experienced a recovery with mid-single-digit growth, largely driven by biologics, CROs and generics, including strong growth at large pharma accounts. After very significant declines in the first half, China grew at low single digits, driven by an acceleration in food and pharma, as well as strength in TA instruments, driven by investments in 5G networks across the country. This was partially offset by continued weakness in academia and government. India also recovered with double-digit growth. The third quarter benefited from some catch-up of revenues, which was delayed from the first half of the year and looking ahead, while customer activity and access are improving, we remain cautious. We continue to face variability in our end markets and macroeconomic concerns tied to COVID-19, and academic customers - customer trends remain depressed. Moreover, we are uncertain on the level of capital spending in the fourth quarter, particularly by our pharma and industrial customers. Now let me share with you some of my early thoughts on the company. As the formal researcher who has used Waters products in the lab as an engineer who has modified rheometers and DSCs and as a former customer, my - I believe my 25 year experience at pharma and tools has prepared me well to work with my colleagues to transform Waters. Indeed, it is a transformation to return a champion to where it belongs. Since the announcement in mid-July, I spent most of my time listening and learning. I met with investors and shareholders, including many of you, talked with and visited customers, read and research and conducted many deep dives with my colleagues around the globe. My learning is far from done. But today, I can share with you the ideas that resulted from this deep transparency phase. First, Waters has built a solid foundation with exposure to a number of attractive end markets. Second, despite this strong foundation, our momentum has stalled in the last few years. Third and finally, we are already developing a transformation plan with tangible short-term actions. Let's take each of these in turn. First, we have a solid foundation in attractive markets, our largest end market pharma benefiting from growth of biologics and continued development of novel modalities. Moreover, our strong base in small molecules, which represents approximately 75% to 80% of pharmaceutical industry sales, will benefit from the growth of CROs, oligonucleotide and mRNA therapeutics, as well as the increasing potential for repatriation of small molecule manufacturing. We have a global footprint with 25% of our sales coming from China and India. We have a solid base in these markets that is characterized by trusted brands, deep customer relationships and a culture that is rooted in science and engineering. In my customer meetings, Waters' employees are acutely aware of the issues facing our customers and are so tightly integrated with them that I often had a tough time distinguishing between our employees and that of our customers. Finally, as we look to strengthen to further strengthen this space, our high margin and free cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest. Second, despite this strong foundation, we have underperformed both our historical growth and that of the market for the last few years. Our performance has trailed the market in LC, mass spec and thermal analysis. We were slow to respond to the transition of food testing from government labs to contract testing labs in China. Our product launches have not met expectations that we set. BioAccord, while the product that clearly meets the need, has been slower on the uptake than anticipated. Our culture is one that appreciates deep scientific insights, but one that has lacked focus and urgency. Strategically, the focus of our - strategically, the focus on our portfolio on LC, LC-MS and thermal analysis has limited our ability to keep up with emerging trends like bioprocessing, contract manufacturing and testing or diagnostics. This is evident in our lack of exposure to tailwinds from COVID-19 as compared to some of our peers. Third, so where to from here. While we are still continuing an in-depth analysis and developing our transformation strategy, some teams are already emerging. And let me break these into three. First, in the near-term, we are focused on making changes to regain commercial momentum. Second, in the mid-term, the focus is on the pipeline and organic growth with intense focus [ph] and urgency. And finally, as we strengthen our organic growth, we will start to examining strategic investments. Let me give you some concrete examples on it in the near term. First, we are squarely focused on regaining our footing in LC instrumentation. For instance, we have identified all the units in both our installed base and in the larger empower network and implemented a specific program to upgrade and replace older systems with Waters HPLC instrument portfolio, including with the new Arc HPLC. For example, there are thousands of Alliance systems in service that are more than 20 years old and in need of an upgrade. Second, approximately 20% of our consumable sales go through the e-commerce channel. For many of our competitors, this number is over 50%. In the near term, we are implementing actions to increase traffic to this channel, such as increasing paid search and improving search engine optimization. Third, our penetration in CRO channel trails our competition. We will increase our commercial presence to penetrate this growing channel at a level that better aligns with our peers. Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we still have a lot of faith in the success of BioAccord. Customers in QA/QC are conservative, and we need to spend a lot more time developing methods in collaboration with them and further developing enterprise level software to help them deploy system seamlessly. As you can see, there are near term actions that are backed by detailed targets and KPIs. However, I want to be clear, these changes will take time and will not significantly impact our results overnight, especially as we implement these initiatives amid the background of COVID-19. However, I can assure you the team is very engaged and have seen an impressive increase in drive and ambition in the eight weeks that I've been here. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the third quarter financials. Sherry?\nSherry Buck: Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we recorded net sales of $594 million, an increase of approximately 2% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 1% resulting in sales growth of 3% as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market increased 4%, sales into our industrial market increased 3%, while academic and governmental markets declined 7%. Looking at our product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 5% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 1%. As we noted last quarter, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the third quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 7% in the third quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 4%, as on-demand service bounced back to mid single-digit growth, along with continued growth in service plan revenues within the Waters product line. Breaking third quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 3%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 8%. Combined LC instrument platform sales and LC-MS instrument platform sales were flat, and TA's instrumentation system sales declined 10%. Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were flat, with China up 3%; sales in the Americas grew 2%, with US growing 5%; and European sales grew 5%. Before I comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year, I'd like to update you on the progress of our cost actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are on track to achieve cost savings of approximately $100 million for the year relative to our pre-COVID internal plan. We achieved approximately 25% of our planned annual savings in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date savings against our internal plan to 85%, with the majority recognized in the second quarter. We expect to realize the remaining 15% in the fourth quarter. Returning to our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance, gross margin for the quarter was 55.8% compared to 58.2% in the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of unfavorable FX, as well as fixed cost absorption and sales mix. Moving down the third quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 1% on a constant currency basis, and foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by approximately 2% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of variable cost in the prior year quarter and FX. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 15.8%, which was about flat for the prior year. Net interest expense was $7 million, a decrease of about $1 million. Our average share count came in at 62.3 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 7% or about 4 million shares lower than in the third quarter of last year, as a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused the subsequent to which we paused the share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased to $2.16 in comparison to $2.13 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share decreased to $2.03, compared to $2.07 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our third quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 53% year-over-year to $190 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $7 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to 2017 U.S. tax reform. In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow and $0.31 year-to-date. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost savings actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle. We continue to make good progress on our working capital improvement plan. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 76 days this quarter, down four days compared to the third quarter of last year, and down 11 days from the second quarter. Inventories decreased by $42 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $397 million and debt of $1.6 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.2 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.6 times at the end of the third quarter. We also have $1.2 billion available on our bank revolver for total available liquidity of $1.6 billion at the end of third quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth; balance sheet strength and flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. Our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged. While our near-term focus is maintaining financial flexibility in light of variability in the macro environment. While our share repurchase program is paused during the fourth quarter, it still remains an important part of our capital deployment priorities. We will provide an update on our capital deployment plans during our Q4 earnings call in February of 2021. Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on our outlook. Market conditions remain variable, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are not in a position to provide detailed guidance. However, I'd like to provide you with color on how we're viewing market conditions in the fourth quarter. We assume similar levels of customer access, as we saw in the third quarter, which reflects the challenging macro environment. Our outlook does not anticipate a return to lockdown seen earlier in the year at the height of pandemic. And in addition, we believe that some delayed purchases from the first half of the year were realized during the third quarter, and there is limited visibility in future end capital budgeting plans for both pharma and industrial customers in the fourth quarter. In light of these dynamics, we anticipate that fourth quarter revenue on a constant currency basis will most likely decline at a low to mid single-digit rate. In addition, I'd like to provide a few other assumptions that will be helpful for modeling purposes. Recurring revenue benefited from two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which is factored into our outlook. We now expect full year operating expenses to be in the range of down 1% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, at current rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth, to positively impact operating expense growth by less than 1 percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about 3 percentage points. For the full year, net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, primarily due to lower debt levels. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Sherry. In summary, we're pleased with the third quarter results, but market conditions remain variable amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, lingering concerns around fourth quarter capital spending by both pharma and industrial customers and academic customer trends. Overall, I believe that we have a solid foundation, but to return to our deserved place in the tools industry, we need to improve our operational execution in the short term and focus our teams on what matters. And then in the mid term, our focus will return to strategically building our portfolio. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho, we've now opened up your line.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Good morning. Good to connect with you Udit. I think as was being thought about kind of the portfolio review, prior management had obviously acknowledged in share loss and the high-resolution part of the market is. You look at the portfolio today, has your view on the share loss differed from what we heard previously from management? How much do you think could be captured by revitalizing the R&D organization? Can you talk a little bit more about the upgrade opportunity you alluded to? And where do you see gaps or potential divestitures, if those are on the table as well? Thanks.\nUdit Batra: Broad question, Tycho. Thank you, very much, and good morning. Look, I've been here only eight weeks, and I've been spending most of my time in listening and learning. But let me start by reemphasizing that we have one of the best bases in the industry. If you ask me, what do you want as a starting point? I would have said pharma, informatics in China, and there you have it. That's Waters. So as I've said, we have indeed lost some momentum in the last few years. And I think you're right, call out the share loss in LC and mass spec and thermal analysis. We have indeed lost some of this momentum, and we need to build it back step by step. While the long-term plan is far from complete some of the near-term actions to address the commercial momentum are really clear, we've already actively started to work on identifying and replacing healthy instruments that are almost two decades old in more cases, and the Arc HPLC is a good new product to do so. From a channel perspective, I think we can increase our e-commerce presence given that close to 20% of our consumables business goes through this channel. And from a customer perspective, we have the opportunity to increase our penetration in CROs. So in summary, we are acting on some short-term plans. And overall, we hope that in the mid-term, we are able to return to a sustained growth, hopefully, in line with the market, but it's too early to get into any more specifics.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then for the follow-up, two of the questions we've gotten a lot from investors are on the level of reinvestment that's going to be required. So I'm wondering from a higher level, I know you don't want to talk too much about 2021 but to what degree should we think about you guys sacrificing margins for growth going forward and really reinvesting on the business? And then number two, on capital deployment, I know it's early. You're not ready to talk about M&A yet, but you obviously have a good track record from your experience at Merck KGaA with some big transformative deals. So how should we think about your broader views on M&A over the long haul? Would you consider something more transformative down the road? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Tycho, thanks for the question. And I think the answer is as expected. Look, everything is on the table. I mean, right now, we're just delineating the plan. All I've focused on is to get going with a no regret moves. And if some of them require additional investments, we'll look at it, and we'll look at the return, and we'll do it. From a long-term perspective, in rebuilding the portfolio, all options are on the table, but I think it's too early to comment on it. I think we first need to get our operational execution back on track. And we will continue to identify near term actions. And as we identify them, we will get going. So I'm not waiting to finish the planning before starting motion. So basically, I've just given you three, four examples of what we've already started. I hope that clarifies the current focus. It's really on getting the momentum back, while we build the long-term plan. And as that emerges, we'll share it with you.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Vijay Kumar. Vijay, your line is now open. You may open up your line.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Daniel [ph] on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, any color on quantifying the instruments catch up benefit in 3Q? And is there any change to how you're thinking about the 4Q budget flush, or is it the same as three months ago?\nUdit Batra: I think on the catch-up, no, I don't think we'll be able to quantify that for you any further. As far as Q4 is concerned and catch-up, look, we're first, very, very relieved and happy with the low single-digit growth that we've seen, and which is better than anticipated, especially after the decline in the first half. So under the circumstances, we're quite happy with these results. As to Q4, while the long-term prospects of the business are quite robust with solid growth in pharma and nice exposure to China and India, it's really difficult to predict what will happen in Q4, especially given the uncertainty that many customers are still facing due to COVID-19. And the fact, that close to 50% of our sales for the fourth quarter comes in December, we remain cautious. Additionally, as I mentioned, we had some catch-up from the first half of the year in Q3, which might not repeat. So despite all of this uncertainty, our focus is really on short-term execution. So really not much more to say about the capital outlay in Q4. But we're closing\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the color. And then my follow-up, any more color on drivers of margins? It looks like gross margins came in below Street models, but then you guys beat on the OM line. So just any color on drivers there would be very helpful?\nSherry Buck: Thanks for the question. Yeah. So if you look at our gross margins, it came in at 55.8%, and there primarily two big drivers around that. About half of that impact was driven by FX. And then rest of that was primarily strength, primarily mix due to the strength in our MS portfolio with - double digits. And just if you step back a little bit and look at our gross margin performance over the course of the year, it's been variable due to a variety of factors. This quarter, it was impacted by COVID. Second quarter, our gross margins were up really helped by our cost actions. And so if I really step back and look at our year-to-date gross margin performance, we're at 56.5% versus 58% last year and about 100 basis points of that was really due to FX factors. So as I look at the top line being down in the 6% range through year-to-date, I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the costs in a challenging environment. So those are the primary drivers for our Q3 gross margins.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the call.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. You may now read your question.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks. This is Mike on for Derek. First, I want to follow-up some earlier comments. You had some interesting specifics on the BioAccord. Just given it's been promised for so long as the next major future growth driver. I was just curious what specific steps do you think you've outlined to accelerate that and to get that to deliver on the promise? And it's interesting, you also flagged the ACQUITY and the time it took for that to ramp up. And obviously, the major contributor is today. Is that something we should use as a road map for BioAccord specifically? And how do you feel is that being a major growth driver going forward?\nUdit Batra: Thanks for the question. Look, let me first start by saying that there is a clear unmet need in QA/QC release of biologics, and this is especially apparent to me, given my previous background in bioprocessing. BioAccord is exactly the right product to fill this gap. I've had a chance to talk to some of my - some of the customers and many of my old colleagues who are using BioAccord for testing of biologics. And with its simplicity and dedicated workflows in peptide mapping, Glycan analysis, intact mass an oligonucleotide analysis, this is the right instrument to bring LC-MS into QA/QC. And I want to make sure that I stated that before I made any other cautionary statements. In fact, we have seeded BioAccord virtually in all large pharma's already. However, as you know, it takes years for a new product to embed itself in the conservative QA/QC environment. And as I mentioned, ACQUITY took close to 4 years. You can start to use that as a reference, but I'm sure we'll dig out other references of products that have taken probably equally long in that space. So while the product is very good, I don't expect it to move the needle in the short term. Over the long term, it has very, very good prospects, and we continue to develop its applications. So I hope that gives you color on BioAccord. In terms of specific steps, really, it's about talking to the customers, getting it seeded and doing the market development cautiously and diligently. That's where we're focused now.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. That's really helpful. And I want to stick on some of the new product launches in the pipeline. I mean, Waters has had a pretty steady cadence of products in the last 12 to 18 months more on the mass spec side, SELECT SERIES Cyclic to SYNAPT XS. I'm wondering, as you re-examine the portfolio and sort of lay out the road map, is there any promise in these products? Is there something in the pipeline that you think you can point to? Is it a little bit more of a harder reset on the innovation front?\nUdit Batra: It's also a very good question. Look, apart from BioAccord, you mentioned the refresh of the mass spec portfolio, both on the higher end Cyclic and SYNAPT and on the tandem quad, and this is Xevo TQ-S, GC, Xevo TQ-S cronos and coincidently, all of these products have done very well in Q3. This is why we see a double-digit growth of mass spec, a high res mass spec in the U.S. and in rest of Europe. And our tandem quad portfolio for food safety testing and traditional Chinese medicine in China. So we're seeing some good uptake for these products. So the focus on new product development will continue. And on the LC side, you've seen Arc HPLC launch, and this is really a major contributor to our revival and I would say, less decline in the LC instrument space that you saw in Q3, and we are continuing to focus on that. So in a nutshell, even a higher focus on portfolio development. And secondly, realizing the full potential of the launches that have taken place, not just BioAccord, but also the rest of the mass spec portfolio as well as the LC and the consumables portfolio.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks Udit and congrats.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line [indiscernible] from Cowen. Doug, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Ryan on for Doug. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe following up first and the last question. I just want to confirm, again, really encouraging mass spec commentary. Can you talk a bit more about how you view the portfolio today versus competitors and do you believe that Waters is positioned to at least maintain mass spec share moving forward after these new product launches? Or do you believe that more work is needed on mass spec innovation to sustainably return to market growth in MS?\nUdit Batra: Look, I'll go back to saying. I've been here only eight weeks, and I'm still listening and learning. So I have the full right to change my view as I learn more about our portfolio. I am excited by what I see, especially on the mass spec side. I'm excited by the breadth of the portfolio we have. If I'm not mistaken, it is one of the widest in the industry, ranging from high res to tandem quads and to also BioAccord as a first - in somehow first-in-class. So I feel we are reasonably well-positioned. That does not mean we will stop our investment in the area. Don't ask me how fast we will get back to our original share. We are intensely focused on realizing the full potential of these products, as you already saw in Q3. The commercial teams are very focused on this. Our collaborators are giving very good feedback on the product launches. So I'm very optimistic, but I would say it's early days, and I want to learn more before I can give you any more concrete information.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then on LC, so competitors have talked about share gains in chromatography in recent years. I believe this is the first time that Waters has acknowledged LC market share loss. Did I hear that correctly? And if so, can you talk about why you believe Waters is losing share in LC? And what actions can be taken separate from a more active focus on upgrading older instruments?\nUdit Batra: Yeah. Look, I cannot judge what the exact loss in share is, but we definitely have lost the momentum in the last few years. I think that you can be certain of comparing our results to our past and perhaps even some competitors. And I would break the action down into three parts. We're very focused on rebuilding our portfolio, and you saw what I talked about on the Arc HPLC, and this will allow us to replace the already installed base in Alliance, which is now roughly two decades old. So this is something we have a lot of attention focused on. Secondly, on the consumables side, our premier columns were just launched, and these are for metal loving analytes and oligonucleotide as some of those, which are - which I don't need to tell you, are a strong contributor to growth in the future. And then finally, we think from a channel perspective, we are - we have been under represented in the CRO channel, and the teams are highly focused on developing that. So it's a rather comprehensive examination of our LC presence. And we're really pulling all the levers ranging from portfolio to portfolio, both on the instrument and the hardware side - sorry, on the hardware and the consumables side, from a channel perspective, this is CROs and also from a geographic perspective. And the last thing I'll mention is that on many of our competitors have a significant portion of their consumables business going through e-commerce. And given my recent experience on e-commerce, I believe we can take some short-term tactical actions to start catching up. I mean 20% of our revenues in consumables goes through e-commerce. And for many of our competitors, it's close to 50%. So a pretty broad-based push towards LCM, and I'm confident that we'll start to see some shift in momentum.\nUnidentified Analyst: If I could sneak in one more. You talked in your prepared remarks about Waters inability in recent years to keep up with emerging trends like bio-processing, contract manufacturing and diagnostics. Do you believe that you have the right products to more aggressively go after those opportunities? And it's a matter of commercial execution? Or do you believe that there's gas in Water's current ability to address those emerging trends? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: I think the answer is the mix, right? So - and as I said, it's only been eight weeks. So it's all the necessary caveats. Look, the answer is the mix. From the overall - we're very happy to have about 60% of our business go to pharma. Pharma remains the most attractive end market. 30% of that business is focused on large molecule, like, which, as you outlined is the faster-growing segment. Now that said, the small molecule segment of pharma is also very attractive. I mean, look, it's still 80% of the pharmaceutical companies revenue, and that's in small molecules. With recent events, anti-virals have grown quite rapidly as an oligonucleotide and we've seen that show up in our business in small molecules. So small molecules is not something that we shy away from, but your question was more around portfolio towards biologics. So 30% of our business is - 30% of our pharma business is focused on that direction. And we intend to continue to innovate and continue to push organically on that side. And once we've - once we've done that, once we feel comfortable and confident with our commercial execution, given our existing portfolio, we will look at portfolio expansion, and there will be a time for it. It's just simply not today, and I don't have any specifics on that front. I simply mention that because you - when you look at Waters' results, it's very much a core business performance, and we're very happy with it. We don't have a lot of COVID-19 tailwinds in our results. So whatever change in momentum you see is meaningful and sustainable over the long-term because we're really getting it from the core business.\nBryan Brokmeier: Next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Brennan from UBS. Dan, your line is now open. You may now raise your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Nathan [ph] on for Dan. I guess, starting off, can you break down the pharma growth in the quarter, I guess, between small and large molecule? And then, I guess, what percentage of pharma customers are back in the lab? How much did that change from Q2? And was this percentage return similar to your expectations?\nUdit Batra: I didn't understand the second part of your question, so I'll start with the first one, and then I'll give you the opportunity to come back. Small versus large, look, both small molecules and large molecule pharma saw very nice growth. And regionally, especially in the U.S. and in Europe, it was actually double-digit across both of those segments. In fact, our top pharma customers of 25 pharma customers grew in the mid-teens. And in China, also, we saw low single-digit growth in large molecules and small molecules were mid-to-high single digits. So really nice broad-based growth, and you can also see that reflected in our consumables strength. And again, looking at China, this was in the high double-digits. So nice growth across both small and large molecules, as many of our pharma customers start to increase their experiments in labs. I didn't catch your second question. Would you mind repeating it?\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. The second question was focused more around how many of your pharma customers are back in the lab? And how did that trend kind of to your prior expectations? But I guess just to add on to that, can you give a little more color on the low single digit, mid single-digit decline you expect in Q4, kind of, was baked into pharma and industrial growth expectations? And I guess, how much of a benefit do you expect from the two extra days?\nUdit Batra: So I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Sherry comment on the Q4. Look, in terms of customer activity, I can give you three activity, I can give you three dimensions. The service dimension, the consumables consumption dimension, and access to our - for our sales teams. Let's start with consumables. I mean, we've seen the experimentation go up in the labs and consumables growth is mid-to-high single digits and went into the double digits for China. So across all regions, especially in pharma, we start to see activity in the labs, as measured by our consumables revenue. As far as our service - access for our service teams is concerned, we saw some return to normal, especially in China and in Europe and increasing steadily in the U.S., but I would not conflate that with pre-pandemic levels, right. So our service engineers have a very different experience these days and they visit customers apart from having PPE and doing testing before they go to many customers. The duration of the visits are much shorter, as customers have them in, and they want them out after a certain specific period of time. So while the overall activity and access to labs for service engineers has increased, it is still not like it used to be prior to the pandemic. And then finally, from a direct sales perspective, our sales engineers, I would say, have 15% to 20% access, especially in the U.S. and in Western Europe versus what they used to pre-pandemic, and they're really leveraged webinars and a lot of virtual interaction. And many of them, in fact, I was with the sales team in the U.S. recently. And many of them say, look, we hope the customers are willing to engage in the same way, even post the pandemic because it's highly efficient and effective, it prevents unnecessary travel, then you don't need to. And of course, there is no substitute for face-to-face interaction when we're able to do it. Yet that said, there are some benefits that are coming out. So I hope that gives you more color on the access. For the Q4 question, I'll pass it on to Sherry.\nSherry Buck: Thanks, Udit. As we are looking at our Q4, I'd say, first of all, just as we saw our Q3 results, we were pleased with the trends that we saw there. And as Udit mentioned, we did see in the Q4 some realization of delays from the first half. So there's quite a few variables that are really happening. And as we look into Q4, the visibility to year-end capital budget plans is very limited, especially in pharma and industrial. And we do think we'll still continue to see the same level of customer access. But just due to those different variability's, we're guiding or have an outlook of low to mid single-digit rate growth. Not really breaking down the visibility into the end markets just because of a lot of differences there. But some the trends we saw in Q3, we would expect to continue to see some of those strengths in the pharma business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Dan, your line is now open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. For starters, Udit, I appreciate your repositioning on the BioAccord messaging. How are you thinking about Waters connect [ph] which was the other effort put on a pedicel a couple of years ago at investor event?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Look, I mean, Dan, firstly, thanks for your question and your interest in informatics. It's early days. I mean, I haven't yet been able to dig into each and every area in the business to the extent I would like. But on our informatics - on our informatics presence overall. Firstly, in this particular quarter, we have seen some nice return to growth, very much tied to our mass spec instruments. Now if you break it down, and that growth has especially come on the back of MassLynx, and UNIFY. As I think about Waters connect in my early orientation, the ambition is to set up a connected system across all our different platforms. It brings Empower, NuGenesis, UNIFY and MassLynx and Progenesis together in a single platform. The early uptake in some of our customers has been good, especially for certain mass spec instruments and the BioAccord is also on the same platform. We've got very good feedback. It's been quite system across all robust but the rollout still continues. So it's early days, Dan, but the early feedback on Waters connect has been quite good. And I have experienced that personally with some of my old friends and customers. I recently visited, just to give you an example, I recently visited our Immerse Center in Cambridge, and we had some customers from nearby come over and use the BioAccord as well as some of our more recent mass spec launches and it's really a seamless experience. But more on that later, as I learn more, and you'll hear more about it as it gets rolled out, and we hear more from customers. But early feedback is very good and Water's connect is already out there.\nDan Leonard: Appreciate that. And then maybe for my follow-up. You mentioned an opportunity in repatriation of small molecule manufacturing. Can you elaborate a bit on that more? How would you frame that for investors?\nUdit Batra: Yes. It's - look, again, it's early days, Dan. I mean we've been hearing that - we've been hearing early conversation from many of our customers that there is a potential opportunity to repatriate the production of small molecules. We've talked to some of our - some of our academic collaborators also on continuous processing of small molecules. So there's a lot of interest, but no real concrete opportunities yet to quantify what exactly that opportunity would be. So you can imagine, as that happens. And if it happens and as that happens, Waters is very well positioned to serve as the QA/QC providers especially for LC and MS in that space. So early indicators, and I was only referring to some of the indicators and direct conversations I had with some customers, but no quantification to date.\nDan Leonard: Okay. Appreciate the past. Thank you.\nUdit Batra: You're welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Steve, your line is now open. You may now raise your question.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi, good morning and thanks for the time here. Just two for me. One is, so Udit, when I hear your prepared remarks about the strategy, it makes a lot of sense. And when I think about what might be a little different for the Waters approach here relative to others. The size of your installed base is clearly one of the big deltas relative to what some others might be thinking about. But what I wonder is, if you could give us a little bit of an appreciation for us and details around, why it is that, that's something that you can catalyze when it hasn't happened previously, and how do you do that in the field? And how do you think about the competitive dynamics going after this replacement cycle in that space? Why would that be different from other verticals? And then I do have a follow-up. Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Look, I wouldn't call it a strategic initiative. I would call it a tactical, no regret move. When you learn that roughly over 8,000 of your Alliance instruments in the field are over 20 years old, you obviously ask the question, can you and replace it. And when I was presented with that fact, I asked team, what can we do to replace it is their custom - are there customers who would want to do it, and the obvious answer is, yeah, I mean we should, but we haven't really gone after it specifically. So if you ask me about the tactical execution, we have the names, the ZIP codes of the customers who have these Alliance instruments, as you well know from your Waters history. With the 80,000 or so installed base, 8,400 is about - I think, about 8,400 is the Alliance base, which is over 20 years old. So we know exactly where they are. And the intent is to go and have a conversation with the customers, especially now I feel more confident when I saw the results for Arc HPLC, given its superior performance for that particular segment, I would think that there is an impetus to move customers to it. From a competitive standpoint, we feel very well-positioned because customers have had a very good experience with Alliance over the years. It's a robust instrument, especially within power as it's informatics backbone. And we think that the transition is possible. Now don't ask me if all and at what fraction at what rate this will happen. This is why I'm not giving you concrete time lines and concrete quantification of how fast this will happen. But it is something that we feel has a potential to capitalize growth.\nSteve Beuchaw: Okay. Much appreciated it. And then I wanted to follow-up on the commentary regarding expectations for the fourth quarter. It's always difficult to forecast the fourth quarter because of year-end dynamics. And, of course, this year is more difficult than most. But just to make sure that people had as much of a calibration as they can for how things are evolving, I wonder if you'd be comfortable speaking to order trends through 3Q and here in October or even new indications of interest just to give folks a sense for how things are evolving because it's not necessarily true that you're seeing any pullback in a situation where just because of budget flush dynamics 4Q might impact the down year-on-year? And then I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.\nUdit Batra: I'll let Sherry comment on Q4. Go ahead, Sherry.\nSherry Buck: Yes. Hi Steve, thanks for the question. So as you look at our Waters business and how quarters play out, much of our business is done in the last month of the quarter. Coming into this quarter, I mean, market conditions are still pretty similar. And things are progressing as we expect. But it's really too early to pinpoint that really given the variability with some of the dynamics with COVID, et cetera. And I'd say we're very much focused on our execution. We have several leading indicators that we're looking at as far as access to our service and to labs and those are things that we will monitor and execute. But we're just really focused on those things and just with the visibility and the variability there are providing that kind of an outlook for the fourth quarter.\nUdit Batra: I mean, Steve, just to embellish just a little bit, I think no real change in trends, but we are cautious because 50% of the revenue, as Sherry has informed me, comes in December for Q4, and it's very much dependent on the capital of place. So very difficult to predict, especially in this uncertain environment, how much that capital outlay is going to be. And that's the number one reason why we feel a bit cautious. But really, I mean, nice momentum into Q3 and nice shift from Q1 and Q2. And we are all hoping that it remains, but difficult to predict.\nSteve Beuchaw: Got it. That's great color. Thank you, again.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Sung Ji Nam. Sung Ji, your line is now open. You may now raise your question. And by the way, Sung Ji is from BTIG.\nSung Ji Nam: Thanks for taking the question. Udit or Sherry, could you help me reconcile the decline - the growth in the industrial segment and also the decline in the - versus the decline in the TA business? I'm sorry if I missed it. Was it largely due to the material science segment being weaker and then food and environmental testing being stronger?\nUdit Batra: Sure. Firstly, on the TA segment, Sung Ji - on the TA business, TA has continued an 8% or so decline, as we mentioned. And China was really the bright spot with mid-teens growth, especially in the semiconductor space and the U.S. with low single-digits. The other regions continue to decline, and that affected the overall number. And you're right to say that it's especially in the materials and the polymer segment. I must say, you didn't ask, but I'll tell you, I had the chance to visit my colleagues at TA in Newcastle, Albert virtually. I am so excited about the technological depth and the leadership in rheology, calorimetry, mechanical analysis. I also spoke to some of my old professors. I'm a chemical engineer by training, both undergrad and graduate school and our academic collaborators and we see a terrific future for structured property relationships that we're measuring with TA. So there are short-term challenges, and we've been pretty transparent about those. But I believe the future of this business is very, really good. As far as other commentary on the industrial segment, I mean, we saw - and then you would recognize that we report food under industrial, especially food safety in China, food in the United States, both saw growth, and this is what also drove the industrial segment in addition to the semiconductor growth that you saw - that we saw in China. Europe was flattish in the industrial segment. I hope that gives you the color you wanted.\nBryan Brokmeier: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question is coming from the line of Jack Meehan. Jack your line is now open. And by the way Jack is from Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. Udit, I wanted to push you a little bit more on some of the urgency around business investment. If you look across the landscape now, you mentioned how some of the tools companies, your peers are seeing big COVID tailwinds, and they're also making pretty significant investments back in their business. Can you just help us understand, why does it make sense for you to push ahead with some of the cost savings programs from earlier this year when you're trying to reposition yourself for better growth?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Jack, I should have expected that question from you. I'll start on the cost savings part, and then I'll give you a view on how I see future investments and some concrete ideas there. Please go ahead, Sherry.\nSherry Buck: Hi, Jack, yeah. So as we - at the beginning of the year and as we saw COVID impact, we felt like it was important to take these cost actions as we were going into Q2, particularly as being that is our most challenging quarter. So most of those cost actions have been completed through the end of July, particularly around employee related items as we've had furloughs back and over stored hours and salaries. And as we were doing this, though, we were also looked at projects that we would continue to support and prioritize. And so I'd say largely, those are behind us. There's still a few things in fourth quarter. But things that we delayed, we don't feel like impacted near-term milestones. And I think we're very well-positioned from both our cash flow results that we had this quarter as well as from a balance sheet to look at the right investments in the business for growth. And I'll let Udit carry on those - some of those thoughts.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Jack, on the investment side, look, there's - as I mentioned, there's need for commercial investment on the CRO side. We are underrepresented in that segment virtually globally. So as soon as we quantify what that looks like by region, in Europe, we've already started. As other regions come forward, I mean, we will be going to support it. Second, on e-commerce, we are underrepresented in the market versus our peers. And I have some history in that area. So I can tell you that there will be some investment in e-commerce as we come back. First, with the existing platform, especially increasing paid search and search engine optimization and then revitalizing the platform in the mid-term, that will require investment. And I mentioned replacement of the old Alliance systems with Arc HPLC and other - with other hardware, that too will require specific training and focus from our field force, and we're getting ideas for investments there. I expect to be able to leverage our existing infrastructure there, but if there's need for investment, we will not shy away from it. These are value-creating initiatives one doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. And then on new product development, I mean, while I have not finished examining our product development areas, it is absolutely clear that more effort needs to be placed in market development. And you guys were interested in BioAccord, but there are other launches also that have taken place recently on the mass spec side, on the high res, on tandem quad, they require market development. There will be investments in that direction. So both from a market development standpoint and investments in commercial infrastructure, we will not shy away from any value-creating ideas. And I've already tattered off a few, and it's only been eight weeks since I've been here. I see tremendous, tremendous opportunity in our business.\nUdit Batra: At this point, I want to go towards concluding the call. Thank you all for your participation. Despite the uncertain environment created by COVID-19 and the challenges that Waters has faced in the last couple of years, I have never been more confident in my decision to join this company. I hope that was apparent to all of you in the statements that I made. There is an incredible amount of talent in our organization, and we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to turn the business around with improved execution in the short-term and then a renewed focus on growth in both organic and other strategic investments in the future. So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on February 2, 2021. Thank you all, and have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sherry Buck",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we recorded net sales of $594 million, an increase of approximately 2% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 1% resulting in sales growth of 3% as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market increased 4%, sales into our industrial market increased 3%, while academic and governmental markets declined 7%. Looking at our product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 5% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 1%. As we noted last quarter, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the third quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 7% in the third quarter, driven by strong pharma market growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were up 4%, as on-demand service bounced back to mid single-digit growth, along with continued growth in service plan revenues within the Waters product line. Breaking third quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services grew 3%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 8%. Combined LC instrument platform sales and LC-MS instrument platform sales were flat, and TA's instrumentation system sales declined 10%. Looking at our growth rates in the third quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were flat, with China up 3%; sales in the Americas grew 2%, with US growing 5%; and European sales grew 5%. Before I comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year, I'd like to update you on the progress of our cost actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are on track to achieve cost savings of approximately $100 million for the year relative to our pre-COVID internal plan. We achieved approximately 25% of our planned annual savings in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date savings against our internal plan to 85%, with the majority recognized in the second quarter. We expect to realize the remaining 15% in the fourth quarter. Returning to our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance, gross margin for the quarter was 55.8% compared to 58.2% in the third quarter of 2019, primarily as a result of unfavorable FX, as well as fixed cost absorption and sales mix. Moving down the third quarter P&L. Operating expenses increased by approximately 1% on a constant currency basis, and foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by approximately 2% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to the timing of variable cost in the prior year quarter and FX. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 15.8%, which was about flat for the prior year. Net interest expense was $7 million, a decrease of about $1 million. Our average share count came in at 62.3 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 7% or about 4 million shares lower than in the third quarter of last year, as a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020, subsequent to which we paused the subsequent to which we paused the share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased to $2.16 in comparison to $2.13 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share decreased to $2.03, compared to $2.07 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our third quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items. In the third quarter of 2020, free cash flow grew 53% year-over-year to $190 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $7 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation and a $38 million transition tax payment related to 2017 U.S. tax reform. In the third quarter, this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow and $0.31 year-to-date. Our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost savings actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle. We continue to make good progress on our working capital improvement plan. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 76 days this quarter, down four days compared to the third quarter of last year, and down 11 days from the second quarter. Inventories decreased by $42 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $397 million and debt of $1.6 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.2 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.6 times at the end of the third quarter. We also have $1.2 billion available on our bank revolver for total available liquidity of $1.6 billion at the end of third quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent: invest for growth; balance sheet strength and flexibility; and return of capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. Our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged. While our near-term focus is maintaining financial flexibility in light of variability in the macro environment. While our share repurchase program is paused during the fourth quarter, it still remains an important part of our capital deployment priorities. We will provide an update on our capital deployment plans during our Q4 earnings call in February of 2021. Lastly, I would like to make a few comments on our outlook. Market conditions remain variable, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we are not in a position to provide detailed guidance. However, I'd like to provide you with color on how we're viewing market conditions in the fourth quarter. We assume similar levels of customer access, as we saw in the third quarter, which reflects the challenging macro environment. Our outlook does not anticipate a return to lockdown seen earlier in the year at the height of pandemic. And in addition, we believe that some delayed purchases from the first half of the year were realized during the third quarter, and there is limited visibility in future end capital budgeting plans for both pharma and industrial customers in the fourth quarter. In light of these dynamics, we anticipate that fourth quarter revenue on a constant currency basis will most likely decline at a low to mid single-digit rate. In addition, I'd like to provide a few other assumptions that will be helpful for modeling purposes. Recurring revenue benefited from two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which is factored into our outlook. We now expect full year operating expenses to be in the range of down 1% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, at current rates, currency translation is expected to be about neutral to sales growth, to positively impact operating expense growth by less than 1 percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about 3 percentage points. For the full year, net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $38 million to $40 million, primarily due to lower debt levels. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Thanks for the question. Yeah. So if you look at our gross margins, it came in at 55.8%, and there primarily two big drivers around that. About half of that impact was driven by FX. And then rest of that was primarily strength, primarily mix due to the strength in our MS portfolio with - double digits. And just if you step back a little bit and look at our gross margin performance over the course of the year, it's been variable due to a variety of factors. This quarter, it was impacted by COVID. Second quarter, our gross margins were up really helped by our cost actions. And so if I really step back and look at our year-to-date gross margin performance, we're at 56.5% versus 58% last year and about 100 basis points of that was really due to FX factors. So as I look at the top line being down in the 6% range through year-to-date, I think we've done a pretty good job of managing the costs in a challenging environment. So those are the primary drivers for our Q3 gross margins. Thanks, Udit. As we are looking at our Q4, I'd say, first of all, just as we saw our Q3 results, we were pleased with the trends that we saw there. And as Udit mentioned, we did see in the Q4 some realization of delays from the first half. So there's quite a few variables that are really happening. And as we look into Q4, the visibility to year-end capital budget plans is very limited, especially in pharma and industrial. And we do think we'll still continue to see the same level of customer access. But just due to those different variability's, we're guiding or have an outlook of low to mid single-digit rate growth. Not really breaking down the visibility into the end markets just because of a lot of differences there. But some the trends we saw in Q3, we would expect to continue to see some of those strengths in the pharma business. Yes. Hi Steve, thanks for the question. So as you look at our Waters business and how quarters play out, much of our business is done in the last month of the quarter. Coming into this quarter, I mean, market conditions are still pretty similar. And things are progressing as we expect. But it's really too early to pinpoint that really given the variability with some of the dynamics with COVID, et cetera. And I'd say we're very much focused on our execution. We have several leading indicators that we're looking at as far as access to our service and to labs and those are things that we will monitor and execute. But we're just really focused on those things and just with the visibility and the variability there are providing that kind of an outlook for the fourth quarter. Hi, Jack, yeah. So as we - at the beginning of the year and as we saw COVID impact, we felt like it was important to take these cost actions as we were going into Q2, particularly as being that is our most challenging quarter. So most of those cost actions have been completed through the end of July, particularly around employee related items as we've had furloughs back and over stored hours and salaries. And as we were doing this, though, we were also looked at projects that we would continue to support and prioritize. And so I'd say largely, those are behind us. There's still a few things in fourth quarter. But things that we delayed, we don't feel like impacted near-term milestones. And I think we're very well-positioned from both our cash flow results that we had this quarter as well as from a balance sheet to look at the right investments in the business for growth. And I'll let Udit carry on those - some of those thoughts."

            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin with the content, let me say I'm honored and thankful for the opportunity to lead Waters and work with such a talented and dedicated team. It has been a very busy eight weeks. Along with Bryan, our CFO, Sherry Buck, is joining me in today's call. During the call, I will provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results and then share some of my early impressions of the company and the opportunities that I see. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our fourth quarter financial outlook. We will then open up the phone to take your questions. Let's start with the third quarter. Our teams have worked tirelessly during the pandemic to stay close to our customers. We've seen a cautious, return to work by our customers, and this has reflected in our results. After a steep decline in the second quarter, third quarter sales were up 2% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 1%. First, from a customer perspective, our largest segment, pharma, was the primary growth driver in the quarter, with 4% organic growth, followed by industrial, which grew 3% and academic and government, which declined 7%. From a product perspective, our Waters branded products and services grew 3% organically, while TA declined by 8% on a constant currency basis. Improving access to labs, especially in pharma, continue to help drive growth in the recurring revenues. Services grew 4%, while consumables business grew approximately 7% organically, driven largely by pharma. Consumables remain a growth area for us. In fact, earlier this month, we introduced our ACQUITY premier columns, which reduced variability, risks and safe time when analyzing metal loving analytes ranging from oligonucleotides, peptides, glycans and phospholipids. The chemistry on the surface reduces unwanted analytes to surface interactions to produce real improvements in sensitivity, peak shape and recovery. The third quarter was strong for our mass spec systems with double-digit growth. We were encouraged by the demand of our high-resolution mass spec systems in pharma and biomedical research, particularly in the US and Europe, and the demand for our Tandem Quad systems in food safety in China. BioAccord also grew nicely in the quarter. However, it still does not represent a material portion of our revenue. With its simplicity and dedicated workflows in Peptide Mapping, glycan analysis, intact mass and oligonucleotide analysis, we believe it is the right instrument to bring LC-MS into the manufacturing in QA/QC space. I have spent time with several of our customers who are using BioAccord instruments and many of them highlighted its ease of use and a robust feature set that can be utilized across multiple lab applications. So I think BioAccord has a good future, but I also think it will take longer than originally anticipated to significantly impact our core growth. This is a dynamic Waters has seen with prior new product launches, such as Acuity, which took almost four years to reach its peak sales. LC instruments also saw a better quarter after double-digit declines in the first half of the year, with a modest decline in Q3. Some of this improvement can be directly attributed to Arc HPLC, which was launched in June. Finally, to TA, revenues continue to decline in the high single digits, due to constrained capital spending at our industrial customers. Pharma and electronics revenue saw a nice double-digit increase, but this was not enough to offset the industrial declines. Turning to our key geographies. Both the Americas and Europe grew mid-single digits, while Asia was flat. In the US, the growth was driven by pharma, food and academia, partially offset by declines in material science and clinical. We saw especially strong engage with customers who are assisting the fight against the pandemic. Latin America remained soft, mostly due to the continued impact of closures due to COVID-19. Europe also experienced a recovery with mid-single-digit growth, largely driven by biologics, CROs and generics, including strong growth at large pharma accounts. After very significant declines in the first half, China grew at low single digits, driven by an acceleration in food and pharma, as well as strength in TA instruments, driven by investments in 5G networks across the country. This was partially offset by continued weakness in academia and government. India also recovered with double-digit growth. The third quarter benefited from some catch-up of revenues, which was delayed from the first half of the year and looking ahead, while customer activity and access are improving, we remain cautious. We continue to face variability in our end markets and macroeconomic concerns tied to COVID-19, and academic customers - customer trends remain depressed. Moreover, we are uncertain on the level of capital spending in the fourth quarter, particularly by our pharma and industrial customers. Now let me share with you some of my early thoughts on the company. As the formal researcher who has used Waters products in the lab as an engineer who has modified rheometers and DSCs and as a former customer, my - I believe my 25 year experience at pharma and tools has prepared me well to work with my colleagues to transform Waters. Indeed, it is a transformation to return a champion to where it belongs. Since the announcement in mid-July, I spent most of my time listening and learning. I met with investors and shareholders, including many of you, talked with and visited customers, read and research and conducted many deep dives with my colleagues around the globe. My learning is far from done. But today, I can share with you the ideas that resulted from this deep transparency phase. First, Waters has built a solid foundation with exposure to a number of attractive end markets. Second, despite this strong foundation, our momentum has stalled in the last few years. Third and finally, we are already developing a transformation plan with tangible short-term actions. Let's take each of these in turn. First, we have a solid foundation in attractive markets, our largest end market pharma benefiting from growth of biologics and continued development of novel modalities. Moreover, our strong base in small molecules, which represents approximately 75% to 80% of pharmaceutical industry sales, will benefit from the growth of CROs, oligonucleotide and mRNA therapeutics, as well as the increasing potential for repatriation of small molecule manufacturing. We have a global footprint with 25% of our sales coming from China and India. We have a solid base in these markets that is characterized by trusted brands, deep customer relationships and a culture that is rooted in science and engineering. In my customer meetings, Waters' employees are acutely aware of the issues facing our customers and are so tightly integrated with them that I often had a tough time distinguishing between our employees and that of our customers. Finally, as we look to strengthen to further strengthen this space, our high margin and free cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to invest. Second, despite this strong foundation, we have underperformed both our historical growth and that of the market for the last few years. Our performance has trailed the market in LC, mass spec and thermal analysis. We were slow to respond to the transition of food testing from government labs to contract testing labs in China. Our product launches have not met expectations that we set. BioAccord, while the product that clearly meets the need, has been slower on the uptake than anticipated. Our culture is one that appreciates deep scientific insights, but one that has lacked focus and urgency. Strategically, the focus of our - strategically, the focus on our portfolio on LC, LC-MS and thermal analysis has limited our ability to keep up with emerging trends like bioprocessing, contract manufacturing and testing or diagnostics. This is evident in our lack of exposure to tailwinds from COVID-19 as compared to some of our peers. Third, so where to from here. While we are still continuing an in-depth analysis and developing our transformation strategy, some teams are already emerging. And let me break these into three. First, in the near-term, we are focused on making changes to regain commercial momentum. Second, in the mid-term, the focus is on the pipeline and organic growth with intense focus [ph] and urgency. And finally, as we strengthen our organic growth, we will start to examining strategic investments. Let me give you some concrete examples on it in the near term. First, we are squarely focused on regaining our footing in LC instrumentation. For instance, we have identified all the units in both our installed base and in the larger empower network and implemented a specific program to upgrade and replace older systems with Waters HPLC instrument portfolio, including with the new Arc HPLC. For example, there are thousands of Alliance systems in service that are more than 20 years old and in need of an upgrade. Second, approximately 20% of our consumable sales go through the e-commerce channel. For many of our competitors, this number is over 50%. In the near term, we are implementing actions to increase traffic to this channel, such as increasing paid search and improving search engine optimization. Third, our penetration in CRO channel trails our competition. We will increase our commercial presence to penetrate this growing channel at a level that better aligns with our peers. Fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we still have a lot of faith in the success of BioAccord. Customers in QA/QC are conservative, and we need to spend a lot more time developing methods in collaboration with them and further developing enterprise level software to help them deploy system seamlessly. As you can see, there are near term actions that are backed by detailed targets and KPIs. However, I want to be clear, these changes will take time and will not significantly impact our results overnight, especially as we implement these initiatives amid the background of COVID-19. However, I can assure you the team is very engaged and have seen an impressive increase in drive and ambition in the eight weeks that I've been here. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of the third quarter financials. Sherry? Thank you, Sherry. In summary, we're pleased with the third quarter results, but market conditions remain variable amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, lingering concerns around fourth quarter capital spending by both pharma and industrial customers and academic customer trends. Overall, I believe that we have a solid foundation, but to return to our deserved place in the tools industry, we need to improve our operational execution in the short term and focus our teams on what matters. And then in the mid term, our focus will return to strategically building our portfolio. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? Broad question, Tycho. Thank you, very much, and good morning. Look, I've been here only eight weeks, and I've been spending most of my time in listening and learning. But let me start by reemphasizing that we have one of the best bases in the industry. If you ask me, what do you want as a starting point? I would have said pharma, informatics in China, and there you have it. That's Waters. So as I've said, we have indeed lost some momentum in the last few years. And I think you're right, call out the share loss in LC and mass spec and thermal analysis. We have indeed lost some of this momentum, and we need to build it back step by step. While the long-term plan is far from complete some of the near-term actions to address the commercial momentum are really clear, we've already actively started to work on identifying and replacing healthy instruments that are almost two decades old in more cases, and the Arc HPLC is a good new product to do so. From a channel perspective, I think we can increase our e-commerce presence given that close to 20% of our consumables business goes through this channel. And from a customer perspective, we have the opportunity to increase our penetration in CROs. So in summary, we are acting on some short-term plans. And overall, we hope that in the mid-term, we are able to return to a sustained growth, hopefully, in line with the market, but it's too early to get into any more specifics. Tycho, thanks for the question. And I think the answer is as expected. Look, everything is on the table. I mean, right now, we're just delineating the plan. All I've focused on is to get going with a no regret moves. And if some of them require additional investments, we'll look at it, and we'll look at the return, and we'll do it. From a long-term perspective, in rebuilding the portfolio, all options are on the table, but I think it's too early to comment on it. I think we first need to get our operational execution back on track. And we will continue to identify near term actions. And as we identify them, we will get going. So I'm not waiting to finish the planning before starting motion. So basically, I've just given you three, four examples of what we've already started. I hope that clarifies the current focus. It's really on getting the momentum back, while we build the long-term plan. And as that emerges, we'll share it with you. I think on the catch-up, no, I don't think we'll be able to quantify that for you any further. As far as Q4 is concerned and catch-up, look, we're first, very, very relieved and happy with the low single-digit growth that we've seen, and which is better than anticipated, especially after the decline in the first half. So under the circumstances, we're quite happy with these results. As to Q4, while the long-term prospects of the business are quite robust with solid growth in pharma and nice exposure to China and India, it's really difficult to predict what will happen in Q4, especially given the uncertainty that many customers are still facing due to COVID-19. And the fact, that close to 50% of our sales for the fourth quarter comes in December, we remain cautious. Additionally, as I mentioned, we had some catch-up from the first half of the year in Q3, which might not repeat. So despite all of this uncertainty, our focus is really on short-term execution. So really not much more to say about the capital outlay in Q4. But we're closing Thanks for the question. Look, let me first start by saying that there is a clear unmet need in QA/QC release of biologics, and this is especially apparent to me, given my previous background in bioprocessing. BioAccord is exactly the right product to fill this gap. I've had a chance to talk to some of my - some of the customers and many of my old colleagues who are using BioAccord for testing of biologics. And with its simplicity and dedicated workflows in peptide mapping, Glycan analysis, intact mass an oligonucleotide analysis, this is the right instrument to bring LC-MS into QA/QC. And I want to make sure that I stated that before I made any other cautionary statements. In fact, we have seeded BioAccord virtually in all large pharma's already. However, as you know, it takes years for a new product to embed itself in the conservative QA/QC environment. And as I mentioned, ACQUITY took close to 4 years. You can start to use that as a reference, but I'm sure we'll dig out other references of products that have taken probably equally long in that space. So while the product is very good, I don't expect it to move the needle in the short term. Over the long term, it has very, very good prospects, and we continue to develop its applications. So I hope that gives you color on BioAccord. In terms of specific steps, really, it's about talking to the customers, getting it seeded and doing the market development cautiously and diligently. That's where we're focused now. It's also a very good question. Look, apart from BioAccord, you mentioned the refresh of the mass spec portfolio, both on the higher end Cyclic and SYNAPT and on the tandem quad, and this is Xevo TQ-S, GC, Xevo TQ-S cronos and coincidently, all of these products have done very well in Q3. This is why we see a double-digit growth of mass spec, a high res mass spec in the U.S. and in rest of Europe. And our tandem quad portfolio for food safety testing and traditional Chinese medicine in China. So we're seeing some good uptake for these products. So the focus on new product development will continue. And on the LC side, you've seen Arc HPLC launch, and this is really a major contributor to our revival and I would say, less decline in the LC instrument space that you saw in Q3, and we are continuing to focus on that. So in a nutshell, even a higher focus on portfolio development. And secondly, realizing the full potential of the launches that have taken place, not just BioAccord, but also the rest of the mass spec portfolio as well as the LC and the consumables portfolio. Look, I'll go back to saying. I've been here only eight weeks, and I'm still listening and learning. So I have the full right to change my view as I learn more about our portfolio. I am excited by what I see, especially on the mass spec side. I'm excited by the breadth of the portfolio we have. If I'm not mistaken, it is one of the widest in the industry, ranging from high res to tandem quads and to also BioAccord as a first - in somehow first-in-class. So I feel we are reasonably well-positioned. That does not mean we will stop our investment in the area. Don't ask me how fast we will get back to our original share. We are intensely focused on realizing the full potential of these products, as you already saw in Q3. The commercial teams are very focused on this. Our collaborators are giving very good feedback on the product launches. So I'm very optimistic, but I would say it's early days, and I want to learn more before I can give you any more concrete information. Yeah. Look, I cannot judge what the exact loss in share is, but we definitely have lost the momentum in the last few years. I think that you can be certain of comparing our results to our past and perhaps even some competitors. And I would break the action down into three parts. We're very focused on rebuilding our portfolio, and you saw what I talked about on the Arc HPLC, and this will allow us to replace the already installed base in Alliance, which is now roughly two decades old. So this is something we have a lot of attention focused on. Secondly, on the consumables side, our premier columns were just launched, and these are for metal loving analytes and oligonucleotide as some of those, which are - which I don't need to tell you, are a strong contributor to growth in the future. And then finally, we think from a channel perspective, we are - we have been under represented in the CRO channel, and the teams are highly focused on developing that. So it's a rather comprehensive examination of our LC presence. And we're really pulling all the levers ranging from portfolio to portfolio, both on the instrument and the hardware side - sorry, on the hardware and the consumables side, from a channel perspective, this is CROs and also from a geographic perspective. And the last thing I'll mention is that on many of our competitors have a significant portion of their consumables business going through e-commerce. And given my recent experience on e-commerce, I believe we can take some short-term tactical actions to start catching up. I mean 20% of our revenues in consumables goes through e-commerce. And for many of our competitors, it's close to 50%. So a pretty broad-based push towards LCM, and I'm confident that we'll start to see some shift in momentum. I think the answer is the mix, right? So - and as I said, it's only been eight weeks. So it's all the necessary caveats. Look, the answer is the mix. From the overall - we're very happy to have about 60% of our business go to pharma. Pharma remains the most attractive end market. 30% of that business is focused on large molecule, like, which, as you outlined is the faster-growing segment. Now that said, the small molecule segment of pharma is also very attractive. I mean, look, it's still 80% of the pharmaceutical companies revenue, and that's in small molecules. With recent events, anti-virals have grown quite rapidly as an oligonucleotide and we've seen that show up in our business in small molecules. So small molecules is not something that we shy away from, but your question was more around portfolio towards biologics. So 30% of our business is - 30% of our pharma business is focused on that direction. And we intend to continue to innovate and continue to push organically on that side. And once we've - once we've done that, once we feel comfortable and confident with our commercial execution, given our existing portfolio, we will look at portfolio expansion, and there will be a time for it. It's just simply not today, and I don't have any specifics on that front. I simply mention that because you - when you look at Waters' results, it's very much a core business performance, and we're very happy with it. We don't have a lot of COVID-19 tailwinds in our results. So whatever change in momentum you see is meaningful and sustainable over the long-term because we're really getting it from the core business. I didn't understand the second part of your question, so I'll start with the first one, and then I'll give you the opportunity to come back. Small versus large, look, both small molecules and large molecule pharma saw very nice growth. And regionally, especially in the U.S. and in Europe, it was actually double-digit across both of those segments. In fact, our top pharma customers of 25 pharma customers grew in the mid-teens. And in China, also, we saw low single-digit growth in large molecules and small molecules were mid-to-high single digits. So really nice broad-based growth, and you can also see that reflected in our consumables strength. And again, looking at China, this was in the high double-digits. So nice growth across both small and large molecules, as many of our pharma customers start to increase their experiments in labs. I didn't catch your second question. Would you mind repeating it? So I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Sherry comment on the Q4. Look, in terms of customer activity, I can give you three activity, I can give you three dimensions. The service dimension, the consumables consumption dimension, and access to our - for our sales teams. Let's start with consumables. I mean, we've seen the experimentation go up in the labs and consumables growth is mid-to-high single digits and went into the double digits for China. So across all regions, especially in pharma, we start to see activity in the labs, as measured by our consumables revenue. As far as our service - access for our service teams is concerned, we saw some return to normal, especially in China and in Europe and increasing steadily in the U.S., but I would not conflate that with pre-pandemic levels, right. So our service engineers have a very different experience these days and they visit customers apart from having PPE and doing testing before they go to many customers. The duration of the visits are much shorter, as customers have them in, and they want them out after a certain specific period of time. So while the overall activity and access to labs for service engineers has increased, it is still not like it used to be prior to the pandemic. And then finally, from a direct sales perspective, our sales engineers, I would say, have 15% to 20% access, especially in the U.S. and in Western Europe versus what they used to pre-pandemic, and they're really leveraged webinars and a lot of virtual interaction. And many of them, in fact, I was with the sales team in the U.S. recently. And many of them say, look, we hope the customers are willing to engage in the same way, even post the pandemic because it's highly efficient and effective, it prevents unnecessary travel, then you don't need to. And of course, there is no substitute for face-to-face interaction when we're able to do it. Yet that said, there are some benefits that are coming out. So I hope that gives you more color on the access. For the Q4 question, I'll pass it on to Sherry. Yes. Look, I mean, Dan, firstly, thanks for your question and your interest in informatics. It's early days. I mean, I haven't yet been able to dig into each and every area in the business to the extent I would like. But on our informatics - on our informatics presence overall. Firstly, in this particular quarter, we have seen some nice return to growth, very much tied to our mass spec instruments. Now if you break it down, and that growth has especially come on the back of MassLynx, and UNIFY. As I think about Waters connect in my early orientation, the ambition is to set up a connected system across all our different platforms. It brings Empower, NuGenesis, UNIFY and MassLynx and Progenesis together in a single platform. The early uptake in some of our customers has been good, especially for certain mass spec instruments and the BioAccord is also on the same platform. We've got very good feedback. It's been quite system across all robust but the rollout still continues. So it's early days, Dan, but the early feedback on Waters connect has been quite good. And I have experienced that personally with some of my old friends and customers. I recently visited, just to give you an example, I recently visited our Immerse Center in Cambridge, and we had some customers from nearby come over and use the BioAccord as well as some of our more recent mass spec launches and it's really a seamless experience. But more on that later, as I learn more, and you'll hear more about it as it gets rolled out, and we hear more from customers. But early feedback is very good and Water's connect is already out there. Yes. It's - look, again, it's early days, Dan. I mean we've been hearing that - we've been hearing early conversation from many of our customers that there is a potential opportunity to repatriate the production of small molecules. We've talked to some of our - some of our academic collaborators also on continuous processing of small molecules. So there's a lot of interest, but no real concrete opportunities yet to quantify what exactly that opportunity would be. So you can imagine, as that happens. And if it happens and as that happens, Waters is very well positioned to serve as the QA/QC providers especially for LC and MS in that space. So early indicators, and I was only referring to some of the indicators and direct conversations I had with some customers, but no quantification to date. You're welcome. Sure. Look, I wouldn't call it a strategic initiative. I would call it a tactical, no regret move. When you learn that roughly over 8,000 of your Alliance instruments in the field are over 20 years old, you obviously ask the question, can you and replace it. And when I was presented with that fact, I asked team, what can we do to replace it is their custom - are there customers who would want to do it, and the obvious answer is, yeah, I mean we should, but we haven't really gone after it specifically. So if you ask me about the tactical execution, we have the names, the ZIP codes of the customers who have these Alliance instruments, as you well know from your Waters history. With the 80,000 or so installed base, 8,400 is about - I think, about 8,400 is the Alliance base, which is over 20 years old. So we know exactly where they are. And the intent is to go and have a conversation with the customers, especially now I feel more confident when I saw the results for Arc HPLC, given its superior performance for that particular segment, I would think that there is an impetus to move customers to it. From a competitive standpoint, we feel very well-positioned because customers have had a very good experience with Alliance over the years. It's a robust instrument, especially within power as it's informatics backbone. And we think that the transition is possible. Now don't ask me if all and at what fraction at what rate this will happen. This is why I'm not giving you concrete time lines and concrete quantification of how fast this will happen. But it is something that we feel has a potential to capitalize growth. I'll let Sherry comment on Q4. Go ahead, Sherry. I mean, Steve, just to embellish just a little bit, I think no real change in trends, but we are cautious because 50% of the revenue, as Sherry has informed me, comes in December for Q4, and it's very much dependent on the capital of place. So very difficult to predict, especially in this uncertain environment, how much that capital outlay is going to be. And that's the number one reason why we feel a bit cautious. But really, I mean, nice momentum into Q3 and nice shift from Q1 and Q2. And we are all hoping that it remains, but difficult to predict. Sure. Firstly, on the TA segment, Sung Ji - on the TA business, TA has continued an 8% or so decline, as we mentioned. And China was really the bright spot with mid-teens growth, especially in the semiconductor space and the U.S. with low single-digits. The other regions continue to decline, and that affected the overall number. And you're right to say that it's especially in the materials and the polymer segment. I must say, you didn't ask, but I'll tell you, I had the chance to visit my colleagues at TA in Newcastle, Albert virtually. I am so excited about the technological depth and the leadership in rheology, calorimetry, mechanical analysis. I also spoke to some of my old professors. I'm a chemical engineer by training, both undergrad and graduate school and our academic collaborators and we see a terrific future for structured property relationships that we're measuring with TA. So there are short-term challenges, and we've been pretty transparent about those. But I believe the future of this business is very, really good. As far as other commentary on the industrial segment, I mean, we saw - and then you would recognize that we report food under industrial, especially food safety in China, food in the United States, both saw growth, and this is what also drove the industrial segment in addition to the semiconductor growth that you saw - that we saw in China. Europe was flattish in the industrial segment. I hope that gives you the color you wanted. Yes. Jack, I should have expected that question from you. I'll start on the cost savings part, and then I'll give you a view on how I see future investments and some concrete ideas there. Please go ahead, Sherry. Sure. Jack, on the investment side, look, there's - as I mentioned, there's need for commercial investment on the CRO side. We are underrepresented in that segment virtually globally. So as soon as we quantify what that looks like by region, in Europe, we've already started. As other regions come forward, I mean, we will be going to support it. Second, on e-commerce, we are underrepresented in the market versus our peers. And I have some history in that area. So I can tell you that there will be some investment in e-commerce as we come back. First, with the existing platform, especially increasing paid search and search engine optimization and then revitalizing the platform in the mid-term, that will require investment. And I mentioned replacement of the old Alliance systems with Arc HPLC and other - with other hardware, that too will require specific training and focus from our field force, and we're getting ideas for investments there. I expect to be able to leverage our existing infrastructure there, but if there's need for investment, we will not shy away from it. These are value-creating initiatives one doesn't need to be a rocket scientist to understand that. And then on new product development, I mean, while I have not finished examining our product development areas, it is absolutely clear that more effort needs to be placed in market development. And you guys were interested in BioAccord, but there are other launches also that have taken place recently on the mass spec side, on the high res, on tandem quad, they require market development. There will be investments in that direction. So both from a market development standpoint and investments in commercial infrastructure, we will not shy away from any value-creating ideas. And I've already tattered off a few, and it's only been eight weeks since I've been here. I see tremendous, tremendous opportunity in our business. At this point, I want to go towards concluding the call. Thank you all for your participation. Despite the uncertain environment created by COVID-19 and the challenges that Waters has faced in the last couple of years, I have never been more confident in my decision to join this company. I hope that was apparent to all of you in the statements that I made. There is an incredible amount of talent in our organization, and we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us to turn the business around with improved execution in the short-term and then a renewed focus on growth in both organic and other strategic investments in the future. So on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q4 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on February 2, 2021. Thank you all, and have a great day."

In particular, we will provide commentary on potential market and business conditions the company expects for the third quarter and full year 2020. We caution you that all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that may cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2020, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law. Next earnings release call and webcast is currently planned for October 27, 2020. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results, which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled Reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted Non-GAAP Financials included in this morning's press release. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Flemming Ornskov, Waters' Chairman of the Board to make a few brief comments. Flemming?\nFlemming Ornskov: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to join at the beginning of this call for two reasons. First, to thank Chris for his contribution to Waters; and second, to discuss our leadership transition process and the appointment of Udit Batra as Waters' next CEO. I want to begin by thanking Chris for his leadership over the last 5 years and for his commitment to ensuring a seamless leadership transition through the end of this year. Over the course of the last few months, which have been particularly challenging against the background of the global pandemic, Chris has kept the team focused on execution. Throughout his tenure, Chris has demonstrated a clear commitment to advancing a new product cycle that has, in part, helped us establish a strong foundation for growth. As you know, on July 15, we announced that Udit will be joining us on September 1. Udit is a highly accomplished executive with more than two decades of leadership and operational expertise in our industry. He has demonstrated a proven track record of delivering tangible, financial and operational results as evidenced by his prior roles at Merck KGaA headquartered in Darmstadt, Germany. Importantly, he also has a strong appreciation for our purpose, culture and people. We are confident he will help Waters build on our foundation and usher in our next chapter of innovation, growth and shareholder value. I know Udit is eager to get going, and we look forward to introducing him when he officially joins us in September. With that I'll turn the call over to Chris and Sherry to conduct the earnings call and Q&A.\nChris O'Connell: Thank you for the kind words Flemming and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. I hope that you and your loved ones are doing well as the world continues to manage through this truly extraordinary time of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It's amazing how much is happening on a daily basis and I wish you peace and fortitude as we all work hard to improve both health and economic conditions for everyone. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on our business in the context of COVID-19 and describe the actions we are taking to emerge from this period stronger than ever. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and update you on our financial actions as it relates to the balance sheet and cost structure. We will then open up the phone lines and Sherry and I will take your questions. To briefly review our operating results for the quarter, Q2 sales declined 12% and adjusted earnings per share declined 2%. While Q2 was expectedly a bit softer than Q1 in terms of year-over-year growth, our revenue result reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated, an increasing impact of new products, as well as strong execution by our global sales, service and operational teams. During the quarter, we also executed well on our plans to achieve meaningful near-term cost savings to ensure our financial strength and flexibility under a variety of recovery scenarios. This combination of higher-than-expected revenue and the timing of our near-term cost actions enabled us to exceed our margin and EPS expectations. As we enter the second half of the year, we are focused on our recovery trajectory and normalizing our operating spend and investment in the business. I am very proud of our team's execution across the business in this dynamic environment. Looking ahead, while risks and uncertainties in our operating environment remain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our end markets and geographies will see modestly better conditions in the second half of 2020 than they did in the first half. I will provide some additional color on this later in my remarks. As we navigate the COVID-19 global pandemic, we continue to execute against our five-point value-creation model, which emphasizes our unique specialty positioning, organic innovation operating excellence, disciplined capital deployment and a sharp focus on people and culture. That said, I'd like to focus my comments today on our near-term operating priorities relating to the COVID-19 period that I outlined on our last earnings call. We are making great progress against each of them. First, our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our employees and our customers. The deliberate actions and cautions we have taken during the pandemic have minimized the infection rate within our employee population, while still enabling the organization to operate efficiently and effectively. Our multiphased safe return to workplace process is well underway with teams returning to our major facilities in several stages. Our second priority is to ensure business continuity. Our service engineers have consistent access to customer sites globally in order to maintain service and install instruments, while our sales reps have less consistent access given the varied pace of recovery across our geographies. Sales force access has been improving however, as customers continue to ramp up their laboratory operations. That said, our strategic technology investments over the last several years are paying off and have enabled us to effectively serve the vast majority of sales, service and scientific activities with a hybrid in-person and digital effort. We have been successful getting our experts in front of customers through virtual events and we are restoring normal interactions with sales reps and regional specialists where possible. Operationally, we have confidence in the continuing stability of our supply chain manufacturing and distribution processes. Our third priority is maintaining our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity even in our most conservative forward-looking scenarios. Exiting the second quarter, we are on track to achieve our $100 million cost-savings plan for the year, relative to our prior internal forecast. We are nearly complete returning those employees on temporary 90-day furlough to work. We have restored full hours and salaries and we have now reoriented our focus towards investment in the business in the second half to enable our return to growth. Sherry will provide more details on these measures during her remarks. Our fourth priority is to accelerate our recovery, by focusing on actions we can control. In particular, we are taking direct action to, a, maximize the impact of our strong new product cycle; b, target our R&D efforts on near-term product introductions; c, service our installed base either remotely or in-person as customer labs allow; and d, focus our sales efforts on customer labs that are open to operation. In Q2, we saw an increased contribution from our recently launched mass spec products, while launching an important new LC instrument. More on this in a few minutes. Finally, we are continuing to contribute our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19. Our customers have responded enthusiastically to our offers of deep scientific and technical expertise across a range of COVID-19 therapy and vaccine candidates under development. In particular, our unique system solutions have been very useful in critical workflows including peptide mapping, glycan analysis and oligonucleotide analysis. While the short-term revenue impact is minimal, these efforts have been deeply appreciated and have greatly advanced relationships across our customer base while also advancing the fight against COVID-19. Now I would like to make a few comments on our outlook. As we outlined last quarter, our planning scenarios are based on a categorization of each geography into one of three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: containment, recovery and return to growth. We currently believe that all of our major geographies have now transitioned to the recovery phase. As a result, and as I mentioned before, we believe the second half will be modestly better than the first half. However, we don't anticipate that quarterly revenue growth will turn positive until 2021. From an end-market perspective, our largest market pharmaceutical is leading the recovery. Encouragingly, our top global pharma accounts grew in the second quarter and year-to-date. In addition, CXOs and large molecule pharma customers are recovering nicely, while generic and specialty pharmaceutical customers are still operating with more constrained capital budgets. Looking ahead, though we expect most pharma customers to return to normalized operations this fall, risks and uncertainties certainly remain, particularly in Q4, around meaningful year-end budget releases that we typically see. Our industrial markets are recovering more slowly with customers generally operating under tighter capital budgeting restrictions than in pharma. Notably, because these customers provide less recurring revenue than our pharma customers, returning to normal operations doesn't immediately result in a corresponding return of spending in the form of capital equipment. Within the industrial category, material science labs are operating at higher activity level than food and environmental labs and we expect them to return to normal levels more quickly. Lastly, academic and governmental markets are lagging corporate customers and are expected to be the slowest to recover. Many academic labs remain closed or only partially open, while governmental business has been significantly impacted by delayed tender activity. Turning now to our geographies. All major regions have transitioned from containment to recovery phase with each seeing steadily increasing customer activity throughout the quarter. A number of countries, including China, other countries in Asia and parts of Europe are moving through the recovery phase more rapidly. On the other hand the United States, India and remaining parts of Europe are progressing more cautiously through these various stages of easing restriction. In aggregate, as we look to the second half of the year we are expecting improved demand across the business in particular for instruments, as we expect a gradual easing of capital spending constraints in all of our end markets. Looking specifically at China. The pharma market is leading the recovery with solid growth in large molecule pharma and CXOs. Generic pharma remains under pressure as customers remain cautious on capital spending in the context of both the GPO program implementation and the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, China's pharma recurring revenues grew in the quarter across both large and small molecule, which we expect to continue bolstering our confidence that we will see increasing instrument demand over time. China's food and environmental markets were down in the second quarter, reflecting the continued funding pressure that is impacting government labs, partially offset by growth within independent labs. Elsewhere in Asia, recovery is a mixed picture with strength in certain geographies, such as Korea and slower recoveries in other regions such as Japan and India. Turning to the U.S. We are seeing a dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment with various states experiencing increasing COVID-19 cases over the past several weeks and therefore are seeing rollbacks of previously implemented reopening plans. The pharma market is leading the recovery driven by large molecule customers. Capital spending is slowly, but steadily improving and we are seeing strong customer support for our new products. Elsewhere in the Americas, Latin America remains very soft. Lastly in Europe, recoveries in the countries of Southern Europe and Northern Europe are lagging those in Eastern Europe and Central Europe. Pharmaceutical markets are recovering more quickly than other markets with QA/QC reporting growth in the second quarter. Our recent European performance has been stronger compared to the Americas, because many European countries have been more effective managing COVID-19 containment efforts and European customers are adopting some of our new mass spec technology at a faster rate than other geographies as we typically see. Aside from these current market dynamics, we remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation. We believe we are well-positioned to leverage our robust and growing new product pipeline as demand normalizes and we expect continuing increases in contribution from new products. Looking at the Waters' product line, there is increasing evidence of traction of new products throughout the quarter particularly BioAccord and Cyclic IMS. In addition, we launched six new instruments year-to-date and have received very positive initial feedback. These new product launches are highlighted by the Arc HPLC, a rugged reliable and modern HPLC system that is a significant advancement and enhances our strong technology leadership position in the core liquid chromatography market. In our TA Instruments product line, the three new products launched last quarter at Pittcon have received strong customer interest. Material science markets have been challenged, but these products are poised to support future growth and market share gains. In summary, though sales in our second quarter continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue result reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated, an increasing impact from our new products as well as strong execution by our global sales, service and operations teams. We also took decisive actions to manage our costs to ensure the largest portion of our 2020 savings plan in the second quarter, which as expected was a more challenging environment than the first quarter. This combination of better-than-expected top line performance, with the benefits of our cost-containment efforts enabled us to exceed our margin and EPS expectations. Although, risks remain with the uncertain trajectory of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we expect market conditions to improve modestly in the second half versus the first half of the year, and therefore have accelerated our growth investments to take advantage of opportunities as demand recovers. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of our second quarter financials. Sherry?\nSherry Buck: Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we recorded net sales of $520 million, a decrease of approximately 12% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1%, resulting in a sales decline of 13% as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market declined 10%, sales into our industrial market declined 13%, while academic and governmental markets declined to 21%. Looking at our product line growth. Our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue declined 3% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 23%. As we noted last quarter, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there are two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Chemistry revenues were down 4% in the quarter, driven mostly by weakness in academic and governmental. On the service side of our business, revenues were down 2%, as mid single-digit growth in service contract revenues were offset by a decline in on-demand service revenues and spare parts. Breaking second quarter product sales down further sales related to Waters-branded products and services declined 12%, while sales of TA-branded products and services declined 20%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument platform sales declined 24% and TA's instrumentation system sales declined 20%. Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia declined 12% with China down 20%. Sales in Americas declined 15%, including a 14% decline in the U.S. and European sales were down 9%. Before I comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year, I would like to update you on the progress of our cost actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that we shared with you during our last quarterly earnings call. We are on track to achieve cost savings of approximately $100 million for the year relative to our prior pre-COVID internal plan. We achieved about 60% of our planned annual savings in the first half of the year, which was better than expected as we focused on aligning our operations and investments with our growth challenge in the second quarter. This result flowed through our P&L and is the primary driver for favorable performance in gross and operating margins versus the second quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, while we plan to maintain strong operating discipline through the end of the year, a significant portion of our cost actions were enacted for a 90-day period and are nearly complete. Employees are returning from temporary 90-day furloughs and we've restored reduced work hours and salaries to normal levels. As a result, the second half of the year will not reflect the same level of savings reported during the second quarter, as we reorient our focus towards growth investment in the business in the second half. We anticipate the remaining 40% of our cost savings to be achieved in the second half of the year. This plan reflects our core assumption that the business moves to the recovery phase and business conditions improve in the second half. We're monitoring our business conditions and will adjust our plans as appropriate based on the pace of the recovery. Returning to our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margin for the quarter was 59% compared to 58.4% in the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of our cost-savings actions. Moving down the second quarter P&L. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 13% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 1% on a reported basis. In the quarter our effective operating tax rate was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in the prior year. Net interest expense was $9 million an increase of about $3 million as anticipated. Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares a share count reduction of approximately 11% or about 7 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year as a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 subsequent to which we paused the share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter decreased to $2.10 in comparison to $2.14 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share decreased to $1.98 compared to $2.08 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our second quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. We made good progress in the quarter on our capital expenditure and working capital improvement plan shared during the last quarterly earnings call and we also remain on track for the full year.  In the second quarter of 2020, our free cash flow came in at $175 million after funding $46 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $23 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.34 of each $1 of sales converted into free cash flow and $0.30 year-to-date. Our strong free cash flow was primarily a result of cost-savings actions implemented in the second quarter. Turning to working capital. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 87-days this quarter up 8 days compared to the second quarter of last year and inventories decreased by $8 million in comparison to the prior year quarter reflecting revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $356 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.3 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8 times at the end of the second quarter. We also have $1 billion available on our bank revolver for total available liquidity of $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, while our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged, our near-term focus is maintaining financial flexibility and preserving liquidity. As a result, our share repurchase program remains on hold until we see a more stable and predictable business environment. We expect the actions we have taken will continue to provide us with adequate flexibility under a variety of potential recovery scenarios. Given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our customers we're not providing full year guidance. However, there are a few data points that will be helpful for modeling purposes. Due to the timing of our cost actions as discussed earlier, we expect full year operating expense growth in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year at current rates, currency translation is expect to decreased sales growth by about one percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about three percentage points. For the full year, net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million, primarily due to lower interest rates. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Chris for some summary comments. Chris?\nChris O'Connell: Thank you, Sherry. In summary, while the second quarter was challenging as we expected, we were very pleased with our results, which were driven by modestly better market conditions than we anticipated increasing impact from new products and the strong execution by our team. We are looking forward to the back half of the year, and we are optimistic that the company is well positioned to return to growth in 2021. Before we take questions, I would like to add a few brief comments on our upcoming CEO transition. It has been the honor and privilege of my career to serve as the CEO of Waters Corporation. I have loved every single day working, with such inspiring customers and an incredibly talented and committed group of colleagues. Together, we have significantly advanced Waters over the course of the last five years, including: we have transformed our organic innovation engine and established an unprecedented new product pipeline and supplemented our technology portfolio through external investments and tuck-in acquisitions. We have implemented a new capital deployment framework with increasing emphasis on growth investments, while also returning capital to shareholders; and we have significantly advanced the company's talent organizational capability and technology infrastructure. I will pass the reins to Udit Batra on September 1, knowing that Waters is moving forward from a strong foundation. I extend my warm welcome and best wishes to Udit and my gratitude to our Board of Directors for giving me the opportunity to serve as CEO of Waters. Finally, I want to thank our investors and the equity research community. It has been a pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you the very best. With that, Sherry and I will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, please limit yourself to one question and a one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters' Investor Relations team after the call. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, wishing you all the best for the next phase of your career. I do feel like part of the story that's missed out here is some of the investments, the new product cycles that we've seen. Hopefully, it will bear fruit over the coming years. Just on the topic of new products I think there were some comments on the call about how new products came in better than expected in 2Q. I want to make sure, I heard that right. And why wouldn't this continue into the back half? Because I think the second half sounded perhaps a little bit cautious maybe on the third quarter CapEx commentary. Is that \u2013 perhaps, due to feedback you've gotten from customers. So, any color I think would be helpful.\nChris O'Connell: Sure. Well, thank you very much Vijay for the comments and the question. And you're right. The heart of our strategy is really the R&D investment that has grown consistently at twice the rate of sales growth over the past five years and is now producing this really great stream of new products. And I made comments on the call not just on products that we have launched like BioAccord and Cyclic and some of the tandem quads last year, but also some new products that are coming into the market now like the Arc HPLC and other systems and more that's coming. So, we do have a lot of confidence in the new product pipeline. As it relates to the contribution, yes, you interpreted that correctly that in particular BioAccord and Cyclic have -- it really took a strong step forward in the second quarter with regard to orders and sales. I don't want to quantify that, but we're really, I think, coming into the power curve on those products and I feel good about our pipeline for the remainder of the year. I tried to comment that we do expect a continuation of positive progress in terms of impact of new products in the second half of the year and an increasing vitality index and an increasing overall contribution that we've seen in the second quarter and we expect to see in the second half. That said my comments on the market conditions of the second half are important because while we are seeing recovery in all of our geographies and end markets as you know there are a lot of puts and takes and there likely to be setbacks and so our assumptions don't assume everything just progresses on a straight line, we do assume different puts and takes and that everything doesn't go perfectly. And there is also the question of year-end budget flush and to what extent pharma in particular will release year-end budget. So, that's really the reason for our overall tone on modestly better market conditions. But from a new product standpoint, we believe that story is very much intact and actually getting more exciting.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Chris. And one quick one for Sherry. I think you mentioned OpEx for the year at the midpoint is flattish on a dollar basis. Considering that second half perhaps revenues we're still looking at that down in second half -- the implied OpEx growth in second half implies earnings still to be in the negative territory. I just want to make sure I have the math right on the earnings trajectory here for second half.\nSherry Buck: Yes, Vijay. Just to provide some clarity on that. So, as you know we implemented a number of temporary cost actions earlier this year. Many of them were 90 days in alignment but we have about 60% of that that we achieved in the first half and 40% in the second half. And so we tried to give you some data points around the operating expenses. And so we're expecting on a full year a range of negative 1% to positive 1% kind of year-over-year full year on a constant currency basis. So, that's kind of the commentary around the operating expenses.\nVijay Kumar: Got you. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi good morning everyone. Chris just remind me what are the capabilities of the Arc that you think it would drive a sort of replacement cycle. I'm just sort of comparing it to Alliance in just what are -- basically it's a question of like do we expect at some point an upgrade cycle within your pharma customers for doing QA/QC? Just a little bit more color on that. Thanks. And I have a follow-up.\nChris O'Connell: Sure. Sure. Thanks Derik. First part of your question there on Arc as you know we have a very, very strong installed base and franchise with the Alliance HPLC as well as with the ACQUITY UPLC of course on the higher end. And over the years, we've introduced intermediate technology in what you might call the UHPLC category and that's the Arc -- ACQUITY Arc platform. What we've done is built sort of a ground-up new sort of Arc range program, but targeted at the HPLC market which allows method transfer from any direction, but really a modern chassis and interface really in the heart of where the core business is. And so we think that's going to be a very important step forward in our core HPLC franchise. And will allow the seamless transition of that large Alliance base over time, both mixed and matched as well as new installs. So, a lot of the, a lot of the follow on innovation we've been doing in LC, in recent years has been more in the UPLC category. And we've had a lot of good refresh of the ACUITY line. And this is a very significant advancement, more in the heart of the traditional HPLC franchise, with whole method transfer in both directions.\nDerik de Bruin: But I though that was sort of what the H-class was to begin with. It was basically allowing for method transfers.\nChris O'Connell: Yeah. And it's -- I mean again, this is -- that's true. But this is a broader-based product, more for the core Alliance space. It's also higher price than Alliance and has a number of key target applications in quality control laboratories, such as, batch release testing on small mole pharma. So this provides much greater coverage and ease of transition in that environment.\nDerik de Bruin: Great, and so in -- Sherry, can you help me think about the gross margin going forward? I mean obviously there were a lot of costs, savings come out with it. And it was much better than we thought. How should we be thinking about that as some of the costs come in -- come back in?\nSherry Buck: Yeah. Hi, Derik, so yeah, as we think about gross margins in the second half. And as you noted there, and in my prepared remarks we did get a lot of benefit from the cost actions. So, while we still do have some remaining cost actions, they won't be as significantly impacted in the second half. And gross margin really becomes more of a factor of our volumes mix, FX and fixed cost absorption. So, just maybe to look at our first half performance, our gross margins in Q1 were about 55%. Largely that was a pretty depressed gross margin from it being a small quarter. We had some fixed cost absorption and kind of a one-time FX translation. Our Q2 was at 59% and was probably higher, just driven by the benefit of our temporary cost actions. So, if I were to look at a full year gross margin, I would look at it between kind of that high and low of our Q1 and Q2.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue. And Chris, good luck on your next endeavor. Thank you.\nChris O'Connell: Thank you very much, Derik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. It sounds like Chris maybe just talks a bit more about?\nChris O'Connell: Hey, Tycho, I think, I heard the gist of the question about the pace of the pharma recovery and projects across different sectors. I'll take a first crack at that. And then maybe you can follow-up and maybe get -- maybe your line will be a little better or my line there, as it may be. But yeah, pharma as I mentioned, let me just comment on, pharma, because pharma was our -- one of our better categories. And we've seen from the beginning has clearly been leading the recovery. Encouragingly, the recurring revenue, on a worldwide basis in pharma was positive in the quarter. And instruments were negative, but not as negative as the overall business. And so in that way we do see both the activity levels as well as the investment levels in pharma picking up. As I mentioned, we track our top global pharma accounts which are generally the largest multinationals. And they actually grew in the quarter and year-to-date. We also saw investment from CXOs. And even in markets like the U.S. they were a bit slower to recover in the quarter. Large molecule pharma was recovering more quickly, while we see some of that capital pause on the -- more on the small generic side. We've done a lot of research and surveying, if you will of our customer labs. And generally, labs or pharma labs are operating across the world at about two-thirds of their pre-COVID levels right now, but more than three-quarters of those labs expect to be more at normal levels sometime in the fall. Like I said, one thing we were really encouraged by particularly as we move through the quarter is that the chemistry revenues remained more resilient than we expected and service revenues were more solid than we expected. And so that to us indicates utilization of the base and pointing towards some investments later. We still think all the same things about underlying demand characteristics in small and large mol pharma for different reasons going into the future and are just positioning all of our new technology to take advantage of the continued recovery in pharma. I'd say, I'd point out in particular in China, we had strong recurring revenue growth in pharma even though instrument growth has been under some pressure. And Europe was also positive in terms of recurring revenue growth in pharma with U.S. slightly negative, but overall worldwide positive. So that's a pretty good indicator. And so maybe if there's something I missed about your question you can try another shot there.\nTycho Peterson: Yeah. And a lot of that your final -- is downstream -- the question was whether there's an opportunity \u2013 incremental opportunity for you guys?\nChris O\u2019Connell: Yeah. You're right. About 70% of our business overall in pharma is small molecule and over 80% of all pharma business is either late-stage development or QA/QC. And then we do see opportunity there. I mean, we've been in a tough environment for the last year or so in some of that downstream environment where pharma investment has been tilted more towards the research development and discovery side. Some of the areas that we have our biggest areas of strength have been on balance less invested in. And so we think that there is pent-up demand building and that we're especially encouraged by the nice step forward in recurring revenues relative to our internal expectations in the quarter and expect some of that pattern to continue. So ultimately we know that volumes of large -- sorry -- of small molecule drugs are steadily marching forward around the world in the mid-single digits, and that ultimately will create demand on the instrument side. And we're -- as our strategy has been all along we want to meet that demand with a really refreshed new product line as it normalizes.\nTycho Peterson: And then lastly, Chris on China. You had said 90% of pharma was back online last quarter in regards to China. It was still down 20%. So is the pace of the recovery there beyond your expectations or no?\nChris O\u2019Connell: Actually China exceeded our expectations Tycho in the quarter from overall revenue standpoint. You're right, about 90% of our pharma customers reported being open for business at the end of last quarter. That doesn't mean they're operating at 90% capacity, but their China customers continue to tick up. And so if I look at our first quarter and our second quarter on any metric whether it's total revenue or instrument revenue or recurring, they were all net positive moving in the right direction by a meaningful amount. And like I mentioned earlier on pharma recurring, China pharma recurring was up strong double digits and pharma overall recurring was up nearly double digits. So that recurring revenue service in chemistry piece was a helpful we think leading indicator of ultimately what will turn out to be instrument demand, although admittedly instrument demand continues to lag, although not nearly as impacted in Q2 as it was in Q1.\nTycho Peterson: Yeah. That\u2019s the good thing.\nChris O\u2019Connell: Yeah. Thank you Tycho.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Douglas Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDouglas Schenkel: Hey, good morning, and first off thanks Chris, and good luck on your future endeavors. I want to start on your commentary regarding the second half outlook. If you take a look at Street consensus numbers, it looks like investors were expecting at least a nominal return to revenue growth in the fourth quarter. I can see why you have two extra gains. You're up against a really favorable comparison. You described expectations for gradual improvement over the course of the year, and you talked a lot about new product momentum over the course of this call. So what specifically are you seeing or hearing that would make you confident enough to say today that you think Q4 revenue will decline year-over-year given as we all know it's -- there's a lot moving around right now and it's only late July?\nChris O\u2019Connell: Yeah. Doug I think that's a very fair question. And, obviously, it's hard to look out too far in the, kind of, environment we are in because things change on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. And we're -- we -- I would say a lot of our thinking on the back half of the year is just that it's thinking about trends and dynamics over the course of the half. And we do expect better conditions in the second half versus the first which is why we expect continued positive progress forward. But obviously, we don't ever want to put together a model that assumes everything goes right and all the recoveries are on some kind of a straight line. There is also more uncertainty than usual on year-end budget release. And so even if you look at a quarter like fourth quarter of a year ago, there was some more typical year-end budget release-type activity. And we think that's probably something that is more at risk this year than typical years, but we'll just have to wait and see. Obviously, we have more visibility on Q3 than we do on Q4 at this point and we'll just continue to try to provide clarity on how we think that's going to shape up as we move through the year.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then pivoting back to cost savings. On one hand, it could be argued that the cost actions you took during the quarter made a lot of sense given the uncertainty of the current environment. On the other hand, you cut pretty aggressively in a short period of time. You actually cut 50% of -- you got 50% of your target versus one-third of the goal that you had talked about last quarter and that included R&D declining $4 million sequentially. SG&A declined at a rate that exceeded that of your sales decline. Recognizing bringing back people now and seemingly starting to ramp some investment activity and your guidance actually seems to imply that you're going to reinvest pretty quickly. I'm just wondering as you sit here today should we have any concern that there could be at least a near-term hangover for Waters associated with really just the trajectory of these changes especially given how important investment in both R&D and SG&A arguably are in the context of reinvigorating company growth to levels that approach those of peers?\nA \u2013 Chris O'Connell: It's interesting question. And we obviously thought a lot about how we wanted to shape the cost plan. Also, Sherry add some comments to this, but I'll just provide a bit of an overview. But we knew or we believe heading into the second quarter that that would probably be our period of most significant top line challenge. And so we did want to front end the savings. Keep in mind that the vast majority of our P&L investment is in people and so by really focusing on our savings that we wanted to achieve over the course of the whole year within a period we were able to do quite a bit. And also, we're able to ramp that up very quickly. I think we managed through that very, very well. Our employees as I mentioned are back. Salaries hours are restored. And we also did a lot of work around our R&D -- near-term R&D portfolio to orient those investments towards products that are going to have a bigger impact in the near-term. And we're excited about really an even better near-term product pipeline now than we had contemplated coming into the year. I'd also say that given the social distancing requirements and the remote work, we've been I think remarkably and surprisingly efficient and productive working from home for those who are not required to be at a facility. Even our R&D teams have been amazingly productive not just on the software side, but even on the core design side. So I think, we're emerging from this really well. I think we feel good about the fact that we've actually front-loaded this because it does clear the play a little bit to be in more investment mode right from the start of the second half. And that was our plan all along. And I think we feel very good about how we've managed through that. So maybe I'll ask Sherry to comment further.\nA \u2013 Sherry Buck : No. Chris, the only thing I would add is that our employee base is excited to be back and we kind of managed through this really crucial time in Q2. And while there's still some volatility and unknowns in the second half, we're resuming projects that we've put on hold and accelerating and the workforce is excited to get back to business.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay. Thank you very much Chris and Sherry.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nQ \u2013 Dan Leonard : Thank you. So could you elaborate on month-to-month business trends within the quarter and maybe what the exit rate looked like exiting June or even early July?\nA \u2013 Chris O'Connell: Hi, Dan. Sure. We generally don't want to provide too much of that and obviously quarter-end activity always has an impact. But what I'd say is that the second quarter typical to first had a much lower effect of the typical year-end capital purchasing given the environment, and so there is a little more balance in that sense. But a lot of the interesting insights of that question are probably more on a geography basis and maybe one I'd call out as an example is the US, which actually started quite slow because of the level of containment efforts we saw in April and particularly in the recurring revenues of chemistry, but the US was very soft in April and then better in May and actually quite encouraging in June. So we saw that type of progression in a market that obviously went through quite a bit of change in terms of the overall operating environment. I guess the other thing I'd say is that we track service data really, really closely, and things like service -- case rate customer access, and that data indicates that customer activity really in all major geographies, starting with China and then across Europe, India and the Americas improved as we move through the quarter, and in many geographies that service case rate data and customer access data is heading towards normalization. So that's probably the best indicator we have of overall activity and access is the ability of the service rep to get in there, and those were consistently better month to month in each major geography.\nDan Leonard: Okay. Thank you for that color. And my follow-up is a bit similar to Doug's question. I'm hoping to get a bit more color or elaboration on the decline in the R&D spend, the 15% dollar decline year-on-year. In your comment that you're reorienting some things in the R&D budget, is there anything maybe specifically we might have been looking for that was cut and possible to get an update on the progress of waters_connect? Thank you.\nChris O'Connell: Yes. No, I don't think there's anything really to read into that. A lot of the cost savings in different functions reflect the labor savings component and R&D is obviously a very labor-intensive effort. And we actually feel like net-net, we improved our R&D pipeline, particularly in the near term, and there was nothing major from something in terms of what will affect revenue and our outlook that sort of came off the books, if you will. We were very efficient during this period, and it's not a mode you want to operate in on an ongoing basis, but our team really rallied, and like Sherry said, people are really excited to be back. waters_connect, you mentioned, is obviously a major software platform, and as I alluded to and even stated last quarter, the productivity of our software engineering has actually got up during COVID with remote work. And we continue to meet or exceed all milestones on the waters_connect platform and are really excited about what that means strategically for the company in the future.\nDan Leonard: Great. Thank you.\nChris O'Connell: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time here. And Chris, I'd say thanks for all your help in our second time working together in this type of relationship.\nChris O'Connell: Thank you.\nSteve Beuchaw: I wanted to ask about a couple of things, just going into a little bit more detail on points that have been addressed on the call. One is China. Chris, I might direct it your way, and the other is on the cost-savings program, which I might direct to Sherry. Chris, as it relates to China, it's a very different operating environment relative to the rest of the world, in part, because of the way they're going about stimulus with a pretty unique approach in terms of the way they're going about monetary stimulus, while at the same time there are some fiscal challenges. Can you talk about to what extent that's weighing in how you think about the back half? And then if you wouldn't mind elaborating a little bit on the commentary around the GPO dynamics in China. I've certainly been hearing the same, but hadn't heard that terminology used there all that much thus far. And then for Sherry, before I jump back in queue, pretty simple and though the math might be a little complicated, as you think about the cost savings that you've implemented this year, if you look out beyond this year, think about 2021 and beyond, how much of that cost savings do you think you hold on to over time? Thanks a lot.\nChris O'Connell: Great. Thanks, Steve, and I'll take the first one and then Sherry can take the second. So, China is a different environment, but is also one we obviously know very well. Historically, exactly what you described on the stimulus side, it's been a boon to the markets there. And what I would say, that a lot of our assumptions for the back half of the year do not anticipate a meaningful change or direct impact of that type of fiscal stimulus, if you will, or monetary stimulus. Obviously, the one factor that would be helpful, as we recover in China, would be for the government tendering to return to some normal activity, which certainly can be related to the stimulus. So that's the piece that's held us back in China. But a lot of the more tangible improvement in market conditions is related to the commercial sector, the business sector, if you will. And so, our assumptions in China just continue to call for that steady ramp back up of, not just customer openness, but customer activity level in the labs. And let me also clarify and answer the second part of that, on the GPO, just to be really clear what that is. The GPO now is now the common name that we use to refer to the 4+7 program. So the 4+7 competitive bidding process for generic drugs which began as a pilot program at the beginning of last year was originally called 4+7. Now it's commonly known as GPO and it has gone through several rounds. As you know there was a first national round or what some people called second round late in 2019, which was the same 25 drugs that had been through the pilot in the 11 4+7 cities. That extended to 27 provinces. And then, there was the third round, or what they call the second national GPO round, which happened earlier this year, actually in January, which extended to 25 new drugs in 32 provinces or all provinces and approximately double the value of total sales going through. As I've said many times, before we think this is a real positive long term in the sense that China is trying to scale its generic drug supply and give many more people access. So volumes are going up. There's been almost an inordinate profit pool there that is targeted. And even with GPO prices, the generic industry's profitability in China is now probably on par with the rest of the world, not ahead of the world. So we don't think it's devastating any way. In fact, we think it's very much in keeping with the economics of other health systems. And we've been on balance more successful with the winners of these tenders, since they've tended to be larger companies. And so, all of our beliefs about the GPO program, as it rolls forward and even reflects in provincial, kind of, systems remain. And we've seen the positivity in terms of our recurring revenue and believe that portends future rising demand for instruments. So anyway, I'll pause there on the GPO and hand it over to Sherry on the outlook for cost savings into the future.\nSherry Buck: Yes. Thanks, Steve. So if you look at the cost savings that we took against our original plan from the year, a lot of those had to do around actions around our salaries, hours and adjusting the workforce during this second quarter, where we were a little bit more challenged. The other buckets of our cost savings had to do with nondiscretionary travel, because the things were locked down. So I would say, in general, that we would expect these were temporary and that we would see these come back next year and normalize. Obviously, during this time, we've learned how to be more efficient and effective using digital and video and that type of thing. But I'd say, largely we'd expect these to come back next year.\nSteve Beuchaw: All right. Thanks for all the color, guys.\nChris O'Connell: Okay. Thanks.\nSteve Beuchaw: Have a great morning.\nBryan Brokmeier: Thanks. We probably have more. Time for one more question we can squeeze in.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Chris and Sherry, I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color, just around the expectations for capital equipment in the second half of the year. I know it's tricky, given the progress of lab closures. But maybe some color around how order trends were in the second quarter and just what you're seeing across academic and industrial customers would be helpful.\nChris O'Connell: Sure Jack. Happy to take that. So capital equipment as we look at the quarter, we've modeled certain demand for instruments. We actually came in a little bit better than our model in the second quarter. And so conditions were slightly more favorable in the quarter relative to capital purchasing than we expected and we expect that to continue. And so, while we still see some year-over-year declines in capital spending in the back half of the year it's on a -- it should be on a much improved trajectory. And as I mentioned before here, the largest uncertainty on that as we look out into the rest of the year, its really around what year-end kind of budget activity looks like that typically we see in this industry. That's led by pharma. As I mentioned pharma instruments were better than the rest. But if you look at the industrial and academic side those have been held back in part because on the industrial labs. Particularly in the food and environmental area there's been less activity. Some of that's government activity which has been a little slower government and academic. And then generally the government and academic sector, while actually turning out better than we expected in the quarter is still curtailed by delays in university re-openings and restrictions to government funding particularly tender programs. So I think we're just stepping through this. We do expect modest improvement in that environment over the quarter with the caveat on the end of the year and we'll see how it plays out.\nJack Meehan: Yes. I think that's all fair. And then I can appreciate still expect revenue to decline in the second half of the year. I was hoping to get just a little bit more color on chemistry sales within the quarter just the performance for pharma. And as demand starts to stabilize into the second half of the year, do you think chemistry could actually turn positive in the third quarter? Or do you expect that to be negative as well?\nChris O'Connell: Yes. Sure. That's a good one to close on because the strength of our chemistry franchise and that is a leading indicator on business coming back overall. So we actually headed into the quarter with an assumption on chemistry that we pretty handily beat. Our chemistry performance was actually quite a bit better in the quarter than we expected and that actually improved through the quarter a little bit, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions on gating. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes sort of the continuation of where we've been with a little bit of modest improvement. And certainly as we see more laboratory operations moving towards normalization, some of the assumptions that we made on volumes and then purchasing activity around customers should continue to sort of brighten as we move over the course of the quarter end and certainly could envision that particular type of category turning positive as we get towards the end of the year and in general with recurring revenue as well. So we do see sort of the lead back if you will to positivity and growth probably first showing itself through the chemistry line and the service line and could be -- could see that as we get towards the fourth quarter. So anyway we feel really good about that franchise and it is a bit of a leading indicator as to where the business is headed. So maybe I'll pause there Jack. I know we're a little bit over time so we have to wrap up the call.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Thanks Chris.\nChris O'Connell: You got it. So thanks everybody for your great questions. In conclusion for the second quarter those sales in the overall first half of the year were negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Our team continued to execute well. We have seen an increasing contribution from new products and global market conditions improved more than we originally anticipated during the second quarter. So although the trajectory of the global COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we do expect market conditions to improve modestly in the second half of the year and as always remain sharply focused on executing on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation and we believe we're well positioned to leverage our significant new product pipeline as demand normalizes. So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3, 2020 call which we currently anticipate holding on October 27, 2020. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Please disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Sherry Buck",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. In the second quarter, we recorded net sales of $520 million, a decrease of approximately 12% in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1%, resulting in a sales decline of 13% as reported. In the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical market declined 10%, sales into our industrial market declined 13%, while academic and governmental markets declined to 21%. Looking at our product line growth. Our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue declined 3% in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 23%. As we noted last quarter, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there are two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Chemistry revenues were down 4% in the quarter, driven mostly by weakness in academic and governmental. On the service side of our business, revenues were down 2%, as mid single-digit growth in service contract revenues were offset by a decline in on-demand service revenues and spare parts. Breaking second quarter product sales down further sales related to Waters-branded products and services declined 12%, while sales of TA-branded products and services declined 20%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument platform sales declined 24% and TA's instrumentation system sales declined 20%. Looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia declined 12% with China down 20%. Sales in Americas declined 15%, including a 14% decline in the U.S. and European sales were down 9%. Before I comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year, I would like to update you on the progress of our cost actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that we shared with you during our last quarterly earnings call. We are on track to achieve cost savings of approximately $100 million for the year relative to our prior pre-COVID internal plan. We achieved about 60% of our planned annual savings in the first half of the year, which was better than expected as we focused on aligning our operations and investments with our growth challenge in the second quarter. This result flowed through our P&L and is the primary driver for favorable performance in gross and operating margins versus the second quarter of 2019. Looking ahead, while we plan to maintain strong operating discipline through the end of the year, a significant portion of our cost actions were enacted for a 90-day period and are nearly complete. Employees are returning from temporary 90-day furloughs and we've restored reduced work hours and salaries to normal levels. As a result, the second half of the year will not reflect the same level of savings reported during the second quarter, as we reorient our focus towards growth investment in the business in the second half. We anticipate the remaining 40% of our cost savings to be achieved in the second half of the year. This plan reflects our core assumption that the business moves to the recovery phase and business conditions improve in the second half. We're monitoring our business conditions and will adjust our plans as appropriate based on the pace of the recovery. Returning to our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance. Gross margin for the quarter was 59% compared to 58.4% in the second quarter of 2019 primarily as a result of our cost-savings actions. Moving down the second quarter P&L. Operating expenses decreased by approximately 13% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 1% on a reported basis. In the quarter our effective operating tax rate was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in the prior year. Net interest expense was $9 million an increase of about $3 million as anticipated. Our average share count came in at 62.2 million shares a share count reduction of approximately 11% or about 7 million shares lower than in the second quarter of last year as a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 subsequent to which we paused the share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter decreased to $2.10 in comparison to $2.14 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share decreased to $1.98 compared to $2.08 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our second quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures and excluding special items. We made good progress in the quarter on our capital expenditure and working capital improvement plan shared during the last quarterly earnings call and we also remain on track for the full year.  In the second quarter of 2020, our free cash flow came in at $175 million after funding $46 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $23 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the second quarter, this resulted in $0.34 of each $1 of sales converted into free cash flow and $0.30 year-to-date. Our strong free cash flow was primarily a result of cost-savings actions implemented in the second quarter. Turning to working capital. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 87-days this quarter up 8 days compared to the second quarter of last year and inventories decreased by $8 million in comparison to the prior year quarter reflecting revised production schedules. Waters maintains a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $356 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.3 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8 times at the end of the second quarter. We also have $1 billion available on our bank revolver for total available liquidity of $1.4 billion at the end of the second quarter. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, while our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged, our near-term focus is maintaining financial flexibility and preserving liquidity. As a result, our share repurchase program remains on hold until we see a more stable and predictable business environment. We expect the actions we have taken will continue to provide us with adequate flexibility under a variety of potential recovery scenarios. Given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our customers we're not providing full year guidance. However, there are a few data points that will be helpful for modeling purposes. Due to the timing of our cost actions as discussed earlier, we expect full year operating expense growth in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year at current rates, currency translation is expect to decreased sales growth by about one percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about three percentage points. For the full year, net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million, primarily due to lower interest rates. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Chris for some summary comments. Chris? Yes, Vijay. Just to provide some clarity on that. So, as you know we implemented a number of temporary cost actions earlier this year. Many of them were 90 days in alignment but we have about 60% of that that we achieved in the first half and 40% in the second half. And so we tried to give you some data points around the operating expenses. And so we're expecting on a full year a range of negative 1% to positive 1% kind of year-over-year full year on a constant currency basis. So, that's kind of the commentary around the operating expenses. Yeah. Hi, Derik, so yeah, as we think about gross margins in the second half. And as you noted there, and in my prepared remarks we did get a lot of benefit from the cost actions. So, while we still do have some remaining cost actions, they won't be as significantly impacted in the second half. And gross margin really becomes more of a factor of our volumes mix, FX and fixed cost absorption. So, just maybe to look at our first half performance, our gross margins in Q1 were about 55%. Largely that was a pretty depressed gross margin from it being a small quarter. We had some fixed cost absorption and kind of a one-time FX translation. Our Q2 was at 59% and was probably higher, just driven by the benefit of our temporary cost actions. So, if I were to look at a full year gross margin, I would look at it between kind of that high and low of our Q1 and Q2. Yes. Thanks, Steve. So if you look at the cost savings that we took against our original plan from the year, a lot of those had to do around actions around our salaries, hours and adjusting the workforce during this second quarter, where we were a little bit more challenged. The other buckets of our cost savings had to do with nondiscretionary travel, because the things were locked down. So I would say, in general, that we would expect these were temporary and that we would see these come back next year and normalize. Obviously, during this time, we've learned how to be more efficient and effective using digital and video and that type of thing. But I'd say, largely we'd expect these to come back next year."

            "name": "Chris O'Connell",
            "content": "Thank you for the kind words Flemming and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. I hope that you and your loved ones are doing well as the world continues to manage through this truly extraordinary time of the global COVID-19 pandemic. It's amazing how much is happening on a daily basis and I wish you peace and fortitude as we all work hard to improve both health and economic conditions for everyone. During today's call, I will provide an overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on our business in the context of COVID-19 and describe the actions we are taking to emerge from this period stronger than ever. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and update you on our financial actions as it relates to the balance sheet and cost structure. We will then open up the phone lines and Sherry and I will take your questions. To briefly review our operating results for the quarter, Q2 sales declined 12% and adjusted earnings per share declined 2%. While Q2 was expectedly a bit softer than Q1 in terms of year-over-year growth, our revenue result reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated, an increasing impact of new products, as well as strong execution by our global sales, service and operational teams. During the quarter, we also executed well on our plans to achieve meaningful near-term cost savings to ensure our financial strength and flexibility under a variety of recovery scenarios. This combination of higher-than-expected revenue and the timing of our near-term cost actions enabled us to exceed our margin and EPS expectations. As we enter the second half of the year, we are focused on our recovery trajectory and normalizing our operating spend and investment in the business. I am very proud of our team's execution across the business in this dynamic environment. Looking ahead, while risks and uncertainties in our operating environment remain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that our end markets and geographies will see modestly better conditions in the second half of 2020 than they did in the first half. I will provide some additional color on this later in my remarks. As we navigate the COVID-19 global pandemic, we continue to execute against our five-point value-creation model, which emphasizes our unique specialty positioning, organic innovation operating excellence, disciplined capital deployment and a sharp focus on people and culture. That said, I'd like to focus my comments today on our near-term operating priorities relating to the COVID-19 period that I outlined on our last earnings call. We are making great progress against each of them. First, our top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of our employees and our customers. The deliberate actions and cautions we have taken during the pandemic have minimized the infection rate within our employee population, while still enabling the organization to operate efficiently and effectively. Our multiphased safe return to workplace process is well underway with teams returning to our major facilities in several stages. Our second priority is to ensure business continuity. Our service engineers have consistent access to customer sites globally in order to maintain service and install instruments, while our sales reps have less consistent access given the varied pace of recovery across our geographies. Sales force access has been improving however, as customers continue to ramp up their laboratory operations. That said, our strategic technology investments over the last several years are paying off and have enabled us to effectively serve the vast majority of sales, service and scientific activities with a hybrid in-person and digital effort. We have been successful getting our experts in front of customers through virtual events and we are restoring normal interactions with sales reps and regional specialists where possible. Operationally, we have confidence in the continuing stability of our supply chain manufacturing and distribution processes. Our third priority is maintaining our financial strength, flexibility and liquidity even in our most conservative forward-looking scenarios. Exiting the second quarter, we are on track to achieve our $100 million cost-savings plan for the year, relative to our prior internal forecast. We are nearly complete returning those employees on temporary 90-day furlough to work. We have restored full hours and salaries and we have now reoriented our focus towards investment in the business in the second half to enable our return to growth. Sherry will provide more details on these measures during her remarks. Our fourth priority is to accelerate our recovery, by focusing on actions we can control. In particular, we are taking direct action to, a, maximize the impact of our strong new product cycle; b, target our R&D efforts on near-term product introductions; c, service our installed base either remotely or in-person as customer labs allow; and d, focus our sales efforts on customer labs that are open to operation. In Q2, we saw an increased contribution from our recently launched mass spec products, while launching an important new LC instrument. More on this in a few minutes. Finally, we are continuing to contribute our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19. Our customers have responded enthusiastically to our offers of deep scientific and technical expertise across a range of COVID-19 therapy and vaccine candidates under development. In particular, our unique system solutions have been very useful in critical workflows including peptide mapping, glycan analysis and oligonucleotide analysis. While the short-term revenue impact is minimal, these efforts have been deeply appreciated and have greatly advanced relationships across our customer base while also advancing the fight against COVID-19. Now I would like to make a few comments on our outlook. As we outlined last quarter, our planning scenarios are based on a categorization of each geography into one of three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic: containment, recovery and return to growth. We currently believe that all of our major geographies have now transitioned to the recovery phase. As a result, and as I mentioned before, we believe the second half will be modestly better than the first half. However, we don't anticipate that quarterly revenue growth will turn positive until 2021. From an end-market perspective, our largest market pharmaceutical is leading the recovery. Encouragingly, our top global pharma accounts grew in the second quarter and year-to-date. In addition, CXOs and large molecule pharma customers are recovering nicely, while generic and specialty pharmaceutical customers are still operating with more constrained capital budgets. Looking ahead, though we expect most pharma customers to return to normalized operations this fall, risks and uncertainties certainly remain, particularly in Q4, around meaningful year-end budget releases that we typically see. Our industrial markets are recovering more slowly with customers generally operating under tighter capital budgeting restrictions than in pharma. Notably, because these customers provide less recurring revenue than our pharma customers, returning to normal operations doesn't immediately result in a corresponding return of spending in the form of capital equipment. Within the industrial category, material science labs are operating at higher activity level than food and environmental labs and we expect them to return to normal levels more quickly. Lastly, academic and governmental markets are lagging corporate customers and are expected to be the slowest to recover. Many academic labs remain closed or only partially open, while governmental business has been significantly impacted by delayed tender activity. Turning now to our geographies. All major regions have transitioned from containment to recovery phase with each seeing steadily increasing customer activity throughout the quarter. A number of countries, including China, other countries in Asia and parts of Europe are moving through the recovery phase more rapidly. On the other hand the United States, India and remaining parts of Europe are progressing more cautiously through these various stages of easing restriction. In aggregate, as we look to the second half of the year we are expecting improved demand across the business in particular for instruments, as we expect a gradual easing of capital spending constraints in all of our end markets. Looking specifically at China. The pharma market is leading the recovery with solid growth in large molecule pharma and CXOs. Generic pharma remains under pressure as customers remain cautious on capital spending in the context of both the GPO program implementation and the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, China's pharma recurring revenues grew in the quarter across both large and small molecule, which we expect to continue bolstering our confidence that we will see increasing instrument demand over time. China's food and environmental markets were down in the second quarter, reflecting the continued funding pressure that is impacting government labs, partially offset by growth within independent labs. Elsewhere in Asia, recovery is a mixed picture with strength in certain geographies, such as Korea and slower recoveries in other regions such as Japan and India. Turning to the U.S. We are seeing a dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment with various states experiencing increasing COVID-19 cases over the past several weeks and therefore are seeing rollbacks of previously implemented reopening plans. The pharma market is leading the recovery driven by large molecule customers. Capital spending is slowly, but steadily improving and we are seeing strong customer support for our new products. Elsewhere in the Americas, Latin America remains very soft. Lastly in Europe, recoveries in the countries of Southern Europe and Northern Europe are lagging those in Eastern Europe and Central Europe. Pharmaceutical markets are recovering more quickly than other markets with QA/QC reporting growth in the second quarter. Our recent European performance has been stronger compared to the Americas, because many European countries have been more effective managing COVID-19 containment efforts and European customers are adopting some of our new mass spec technology at a faster rate than other geographies as we typically see. Aside from these current market dynamics, we remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation. We believe we are well-positioned to leverage our robust and growing new product pipeline as demand normalizes and we expect continuing increases in contribution from new products. Looking at the Waters' product line, there is increasing evidence of traction of new products throughout the quarter particularly BioAccord and Cyclic IMS. In addition, we launched six new instruments year-to-date and have received very positive initial feedback. These new product launches are highlighted by the Arc HPLC, a rugged reliable and modern HPLC system that is a significant advancement and enhances our strong technology leadership position in the core liquid chromatography market. In our TA Instruments product line, the three new products launched last quarter at Pittcon have received strong customer interest. Material science markets have been challenged, but these products are poised to support future growth and market share gains. In summary, though sales in our second quarter continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue result reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated, an increasing impact from our new products as well as strong execution by our global sales, service and operations teams. We also took decisive actions to manage our costs to ensure the largest portion of our 2020 savings plan in the second quarter, which as expected was a more challenging environment than the first quarter. This combination of better-than-expected top line performance, with the benefits of our cost-containment efforts enabled us to exceed our margin and EPS expectations. Although, risks remain with the uncertain trajectory of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we expect market conditions to improve modestly in the second half versus the first half of the year, and therefore have accelerated our growth investments to take advantage of opportunities as demand recovers. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Sherry Buck for a deeper review of our second quarter financials. Sherry? Thank you, Sherry. In summary, while the second quarter was challenging as we expected, we were very pleased with our results, which were driven by modestly better market conditions than we anticipated increasing impact from new products and the strong execution by our team. We are looking forward to the back half of the year, and we are optimistic that the company is well positioned to return to growth in 2021. Before we take questions, I would like to add a few brief comments on our upcoming CEO transition. It has been the honor and privilege of my career to serve as the CEO of Waters Corporation. I have loved every single day working, with such inspiring customers and an incredibly talented and committed group of colleagues. Together, we have significantly advanced Waters over the course of the last five years, including: we have transformed our organic innovation engine and established an unprecedented new product pipeline and supplemented our technology portfolio through external investments and tuck-in acquisitions. We have implemented a new capital deployment framework with increasing emphasis on growth investments, while also returning capital to shareholders; and we have significantly advanced the company's talent organizational capability and technology infrastructure. I will pass the reins to Udit Batra on September 1, knowing that Waters is moving forward from a strong foundation. I extend my warm welcome and best wishes to Udit and my gratitude to our Board of Directors for giving me the opportunity to serve as CEO of Waters. Finally, I want to thank our investors and the equity research community. It has been a pleasure to work with all of you and I wish you the very best. With that, Sherry and I will now begin the question-and-answer session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and a one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Waters' Investor Relations team after the call. Operator? Sure. Well, thank you very much Vijay for the comments and the question. And you're right. The heart of our strategy is really the R&D investment that has grown consistently at twice the rate of sales growth over the past five years and is now producing this really great stream of new products. And I made comments on the call not just on products that we have launched like BioAccord and Cyclic and some of the tandem quads last year, but also some new products that are coming into the market now like the Arc HPLC and other systems and more that's coming. So, we do have a lot of confidence in the new product pipeline. As it relates to the contribution, yes, you interpreted that correctly that in particular BioAccord and Cyclic have -- it really took a strong step forward in the second quarter with regard to orders and sales. I don't want to quantify that, but we're really, I think, coming into the power curve on those products and I feel good about our pipeline for the remainder of the year. I tried to comment that we do expect a continuation of positive progress in terms of impact of new products in the second half of the year and an increasing vitality index and an increasing overall contribution that we've seen in the second quarter and we expect to see in the second half. That said my comments on the market conditions of the second half are important because while we are seeing recovery in all of our geographies and end markets as you know there are a lot of puts and takes and there likely to be setbacks and so our assumptions don't assume everything just progresses on a straight line, we do assume different puts and takes and that everything doesn't go perfectly. And there is also the question of year-end budget flush and to what extent pharma in particular will release year-end budget. So, that's really the reason for our overall tone on modestly better market conditions. But from a new product standpoint, we believe that story is very much intact and actually getting more exciting. Sure. Sure. Thanks Derik. First part of your question there on Arc as you know we have a very, very strong installed base and franchise with the Alliance HPLC as well as with the ACQUITY UPLC of course on the higher end. And over the years, we've introduced intermediate technology in what you might call the UHPLC category and that's the Arc -- ACQUITY Arc platform. What we've done is built sort of a ground-up new sort of Arc range program, but targeted at the HPLC market which allows method transfer from any direction, but really a modern chassis and interface really in the heart of where the core business is. And so we think that's going to be a very important step forward in our core HPLC franchise. And will allow the seamless transition of that large Alliance base over time, both mixed and matched as well as new installs. So, a lot of the, a lot of the follow on innovation we've been doing in LC, in recent years has been more in the UPLC category. And we've had a lot of good refresh of the ACUITY line. And this is a very significant advancement, more in the heart of the traditional HPLC franchise, with whole method transfer in both directions. Yeah. And it's -- I mean again, this is -- that's true. But this is a broader-based product, more for the core Alliance space. It's also higher price than Alliance and has a number of key target applications in quality control laboratories, such as, batch release testing on small mole pharma. So this provides much greater coverage and ease of transition in that environment. Thank you very much, Derik. Hey, Tycho, I think, I heard the gist of the question about the pace of the pharma recovery and projects across different sectors. I'll take a first crack at that. And then maybe you can follow-up and maybe get -- maybe your line will be a little better or my line there, as it may be. But yeah, pharma as I mentioned, let me just comment on, pharma, because pharma was our -- one of our better categories. And we've seen from the beginning has clearly been leading the recovery. Encouragingly, the recurring revenue, on a worldwide basis in pharma was positive in the quarter. And instruments were negative, but not as negative as the overall business. And so in that way we do see both the activity levels as well as the investment levels in pharma picking up. As I mentioned, we track our top global pharma accounts which are generally the largest multinationals. And they actually grew in the quarter and year-to-date. We also saw investment from CXOs. And even in markets like the U.S. they were a bit slower to recover in the quarter. Large molecule pharma was recovering more quickly, while we see some of that capital pause on the -- more on the small generic side. We've done a lot of research and surveying, if you will of our customer labs. And generally, labs or pharma labs are operating across the world at about two-thirds of their pre-COVID levels right now, but more than three-quarters of those labs expect to be more at normal levels sometime in the fall. Like I said, one thing we were really encouraged by particularly as we move through the quarter is that the chemistry revenues remained more resilient than we expected and service revenues were more solid than we expected. And so that to us indicates utilization of the base and pointing towards some investments later. We still think all the same things about underlying demand characteristics in small and large mol pharma for different reasons going into the future and are just positioning all of our new technology to take advantage of the continued recovery in pharma. I'd say, I'd point out in particular in China, we had strong recurring revenue growth in pharma even though instrument growth has been under some pressure. And Europe was also positive in terms of recurring revenue growth in pharma with U.S. slightly negative, but overall worldwide positive. So that's a pretty good indicator. And so maybe if there's something I missed about your question you can try another shot there. Yeah. You're right. About 70% of our business overall in pharma is small molecule and over 80% of all pharma business is either late-stage development or QA/QC. And then we do see opportunity there. I mean, we've been in a tough environment for the last year or so in some of that downstream environment where pharma investment has been tilted more towards the research development and discovery side. Some of the areas that we have our biggest areas of strength have been on balance less invested in. And so we think that there is pent-up demand building and that we're especially encouraged by the nice step forward in recurring revenues relative to our internal expectations in the quarter and expect some of that pattern to continue. So ultimately we know that volumes of large -- sorry -- of small molecule drugs are steadily marching forward around the world in the mid-single digits, and that ultimately will create demand on the instrument side. And we're -- as our strategy has been all along we want to meet that demand with a really refreshed new product line as it normalizes. Actually China exceeded our expectations Tycho in the quarter from overall revenue standpoint. You're right, about 90% of our pharma customers reported being open for business at the end of last quarter. That doesn't mean they're operating at 90% capacity, but their China customers continue to tick up. And so if I look at our first quarter and our second quarter on any metric whether it's total revenue or instrument revenue or recurring, they were all net positive moving in the right direction by a meaningful amount. And like I mentioned earlier on pharma recurring, China pharma recurring was up strong double digits and pharma overall recurring was up nearly double digits. So that recurring revenue service in chemistry piece was a helpful we think leading indicator of ultimately what will turn out to be instrument demand, although admittedly instrument demand continues to lag, although not nearly as impacted in Q2 as it was in Q1. Yeah. Thank you Tycho. Yeah. Doug I think that's a very fair question. And, obviously, it's hard to look out too far in the, kind of, environment we are in because things change on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis. And we're -- we -- I would say a lot of our thinking on the back half of the year is just that it's thinking about trends and dynamics over the course of the half. And we do expect better conditions in the second half versus the first which is why we expect continued positive progress forward. But obviously, we don't ever want to put together a model that assumes everything goes right and all the recoveries are on some kind of a straight line. There is also more uncertainty than usual on year-end budget release. And so even if you look at a quarter like fourth quarter of a year ago, there was some more typical year-end budget release-type activity. And we think that's probably something that is more at risk this year than typical years, but we'll just have to wait and see. Obviously, we have more visibility on Q3 than we do on Q4 at this point and we'll just continue to try to provide clarity on how we think that's going to shape up as we move through the year. Yes. No, I don't think there's anything really to read into that. A lot of the cost savings in different functions reflect the labor savings component and R&D is obviously a very labor-intensive effort. And we actually feel like net-net, we improved our R&D pipeline, particularly in the near term, and there was nothing major from something in terms of what will affect revenue and our outlook that sort of came off the books, if you will. We were very efficient during this period, and it's not a mode you want to operate in on an ongoing basis, but our team really rallied, and like Sherry said, people are really excited to be back. waters_connect, you mentioned, is obviously a major software platform, and as I alluded to and even stated last quarter, the productivity of our software engineering has actually got up during COVID with remote work. And we continue to meet or exceed all milestones on the waters_connect platform and are really excited about what that means strategically for the company in the future. Thanks, Dan. Thank you. Great. Thanks, Steve, and I'll take the first one and then Sherry can take the second. So, China is a different environment, but is also one we obviously know very well. Historically, exactly what you described on the stimulus side, it's been a boon to the markets there. And what I would say, that a lot of our assumptions for the back half of the year do not anticipate a meaningful change or direct impact of that type of fiscal stimulus, if you will, or monetary stimulus. Obviously, the one factor that would be helpful, as we recover in China, would be for the government tendering to return to some normal activity, which certainly can be related to the stimulus. So that's the piece that's held us back in China. But a lot of the more tangible improvement in market conditions is related to the commercial sector, the business sector, if you will. And so, our assumptions in China just continue to call for that steady ramp back up of, not just customer openness, but customer activity level in the labs. And let me also clarify and answer the second part of that, on the GPO, just to be really clear what that is. The GPO now is now the common name that we use to refer to the 4+7 program. So the 4+7 competitive bidding process for generic drugs which began as a pilot program at the beginning of last year was originally called 4+7. Now it's commonly known as GPO and it has gone through several rounds. As you know there was a first national round or what some people called second round late in 2019, which was the same 25 drugs that had been through the pilot in the 11 4+7 cities. That extended to 27 provinces. And then, there was the third round, or what they call the second national GPO round, which happened earlier this year, actually in January, which extended to 25 new drugs in 32 provinces or all provinces and approximately double the value of total sales going through. As I've said many times, before we think this is a real positive long term in the sense that China is trying to scale its generic drug supply and give many more people access. So volumes are going up. There's been almost an inordinate profit pool there that is targeted. And even with GPO prices, the generic industry's profitability in China is now probably on par with the rest of the world, not ahead of the world. So we don't think it's devastating any way. In fact, we think it's very much in keeping with the economics of other health systems. And we've been on balance more successful with the winners of these tenders, since they've tended to be larger companies. And so, all of our beliefs about the GPO program, as it rolls forward and even reflects in provincial, kind of, systems remain. And we've seen the positivity in terms of our recurring revenue and believe that portends future rising demand for instruments. So anyway, I'll pause there on the GPO and hand it over to Sherry on the outlook for cost savings into the future. Okay. Thanks. Sure Jack. Happy to take that. So capital equipment as we look at the quarter, we've modeled certain demand for instruments. We actually came in a little bit better than our model in the second quarter. And so conditions were slightly more favorable in the quarter relative to capital purchasing than we expected and we expect that to continue. And so, while we still see some year-over-year declines in capital spending in the back half of the year it's on a -- it should be on a much improved trajectory. And as I mentioned before here, the largest uncertainty on that as we look out into the rest of the year, its really around what year-end kind of budget activity looks like that typically we see in this industry. That's led by pharma. As I mentioned pharma instruments were better than the rest. But if you look at the industrial and academic side those have been held back in part because on the industrial labs. Particularly in the food and environmental area there's been less activity. Some of that's government activity which has been a little slower government and academic. And then generally the government and academic sector, while actually turning out better than we expected in the quarter is still curtailed by delays in university re-openings and restrictions to government funding particularly tender programs. So I think we're just stepping through this. We do expect modest improvement in that environment over the quarter with the caveat on the end of the year and we'll see how it plays out. Yes. Sure. That's a good one to close on because the strength of our chemistry franchise and that is a leading indicator on business coming back overall. So we actually headed into the quarter with an assumption on chemistry that we pretty handily beat. Our chemistry performance was actually quite a bit better in the quarter than we expected and that actually improved through the quarter a little bit, as I mentioned in one of the previous questions on gating. Our outlook for the remainder of the year assumes sort of the continuation of where we've been with a little bit of modest improvement. And certainly as we see more laboratory operations moving towards normalization, some of the assumptions that we made on volumes and then purchasing activity around customers should continue to sort of brighten as we move over the course of the quarter end and certainly could envision that particular type of category turning positive as we get towards the end of the year and in general with recurring revenue as well. So we do see sort of the lead back if you will to positivity and growth probably first showing itself through the chemistry line and the service line and could be -- could see that as we get towards the fourth quarter. So anyway we feel really good about that franchise and it is a bit of a leading indicator as to where the business is headed. So maybe I'll pause there Jack. I know we're a little bit over time so we have to wrap up the call. You got it. So thanks everybody for your great questions. In conclusion for the second quarter those sales in the overall first half of the year were negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Our team continued to execute well. We have seen an increasing contribution from new products and global market conditions improved more than we originally anticipated during the second quarter. So although the trajectory of the global COVID-19 pandemic remains uncertain, we do expect market conditions to improve modestly in the second half of the year and as always remain sharply focused on executing on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation and we believe we're well positioned to leverage our significant new product pipeline as demand normalizes. So on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q3, 2020 call which we currently anticipate holding on October 27, 2020. Thank you and have a great day."

Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today\u2019s call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris O'Connell, Waters\u2019 President and Chief Executive Officer. Chris?\nChristopher O'Connell: Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Sherry Buck, Waters\u2019 Chief Financial Officer. I hope you and your loved ones are doing well at this challenging time and staying positive as we all strive to overcome the global COVID-19 public health and macroeconomic challenge. Like most of you, we are all working from home, so please bear with us if we encounter any unforeseen audio issues with today\u2019s call.  During today\u2019s call, I will provide an overview of our first quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on the impact that COVID-19 is having on our markets and businesses. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and discuss our financial actions as it relates to the balance sheet and cost structure. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  As you well know, the COVID-19 global pandemic is a significant challenge for the world that is putting extraordinary pressure on the economy, our customers, employees, and their families. I would like to personally extend my gratitude for the hard work and dedication that everyone has shown over the past few months.  I\u2019d especially like to thank all of our dedicated employees who have been working in our manufacturing facilities, laboratories, and distribution centers ensuring that we can supply our products and expertise to our customers.  I also want to thank our talented field service engineers who have been on the frontlines, installing and maintaining critical analytical instruments and data systems to support the ongoing work of our customers.  These efforts are incredible and truly inspire me, but they don\u2019t surprise me as I have consistently seen our great people step up to deliver benefit to our customers under all conditions.  To briefly review our operating results for the first quarter, Q1 sales declined 8% and adjusted earnings per share declined 28%. The biggest COVID-19 impact on our business in Q1 was China, which declined 45% in the quarter impacting total company sales by approximately 8 percentage points in constant currency.  As severe containment actions were implemented in China at the time of the spring festival, economic activity and demand significantly decelerated and these conditions persisted through the quarter. On a positive note, it was encouraging to see flat sales ex-China for the quarter and 4% growth ex-China through week 12 of Q1 before broader containment actions went into place in the U.S., Europe, and India.  Rapidly changing market conditions in these geographies during the final week of the quarter included declining access to customer sites as well as the inability of some customers to place and receive instrument orders.  Through four weeks of Q2, we have seen signs of recovery in China and other parts of Asia and Europe, though we expect the conditions seen at the end of Q1 in the U.S., India, and some parts of Europe will persist into Q2 making the second quarter likely more challenging than the first quarter.  As we operate in this fluid environment, we have five overriding priorities: number one, putting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and customers first; number two, ensuring business continuity; number three, maintaining financial strength, flexibility, and liquidity; number four, actively planning for recovery, particularly in maximizing the benefit of our strong new product flow; and number five, contributing our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19.  Let me say a little bit more about each of these five priorities. First, the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and our customers is our clear top priority. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate cautions, including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as bans on non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities.  Early on, we engaged a medical advisor to guide our policy deployment and we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health of our global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions.  Our second priority is to ensure business continuity. The vast majority of the markets we serve, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, food and environmental, and clinical markets have continued to operate at various levels, and we are working closely with these customers to ensure their seamless operation.  Over the last several years, Waters has executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees. Our strategic technology investments have enabled us to swiftly meet the remote working needs as the situation has escalated.  From a customer-facing standpoint, we are leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demos across all regions, remote instrument installations, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and a rapid acceleration in one-to-one communications over emails, phone, and video conferencing.  We also recently launched a new customer portal on waters.com, enabling a convenient and personalized online experience that\u2019s more mobile-friendly augmenting the recent expansion of our digital commerce capabilities. We are continuing to invest to provide our customers a similar world-class experience through digital means as they receive in person, and we are seeing great customer engagement.  From a supply chain standpoint, we have proactively and successfully secured access to raw materials for ongoing manufacturing needs, and we are working closely with our transportation providers to minimize any disruption to our distribution network. At this time, we do not anticipate any immediate supply or distribution concerns during the second quarter and are actively mitigating potential risks.  Our third priority is maintaining our financial strength, flexibility, and liquidity under a range of business scenarios. We are seeking to balance prudent management of all areas of our spend, while continuing to invest in growth initiatives.  We are taking a proactive approach to preserving balance sheet strength and liquidity, as well as to appropriately right-size our cost structure for the unpredictable months ahead. Specifically, we have paused our share repurchase program until we return to a more stable and predictable business environment.  We are also taking actions in 2020 that will reduce our cost structure by about $100 million, as well as actions that will result in about $45 million of cash flow improvement from CapEx and working capital management. Sherry will provide more details on these measures during her remarks.  Fourth, we are actively planning for a variety of recovery scenarios with particular emphasis on maximizing the impact of our exciting new product cycle, including products launched in the last year as well as new technology coming to the market this year. In the context of our cost measures, R&D investments continue to be a priority, especially those that will contribute to near-term growth.  We remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation, and as stated before, we have made durable improvements in R&D productivity positioning us well to benefit as demand normalizes and for the long-term.  Finally, while we are not assuming a material financial benefit, we have mobilized quickly to contribute our expertise and capabilities in the fight against COVID-19. We formed a COVID-19 innovation response team to bring Waters\u2019 industry-leading expertise to the forefront of the global scientific surge to quickly and effectively deliver diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines. By extending our resources to scientists that are working on the challenging biology of the virus and pursuing a range of interventions, we know that we can help accelerate the push to defeat COVID-19.  A few examples include, first, Waters has donated columns, service and instrumentation to hospital laboratories in Milan, Turin, and Rome in Italy and in Bordeaux, Le\u00f3n, Marseille and Paris in France. These donations are supporting drug monitoring and research for potential Coronavirus therapies.  Second, in the UK and Ireland, our team has been working overtime to quickly deliver specialized mass spectrometry instruments for researchers for measuring potential new COVID-19 drugs in experimental models of the SARS, COV2 infection.  And finally, we are providing our unique glycan analysis capabilities to vaccine developers. The significance of the glycosylation is the antigen is underscored by numerous recent publications on the structural biology of the SARS COV2 spike protein. We are enabling high resolution, high sensitivity and molecular glycan fingerprints in just minutes versus the days typically needed with traditional approaches.  Turing to guidance. As a result of the uncertainties surrounding the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our customers, we are withdrawing our prior 2020 guidance, which as a reminder, explicitly did not include any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, I will provide you with some color to help you better understand our current thinking. We have built a range of scenarios by categorizing each geography into one of three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, containment, recovery and return to growth.  Importantly, we anticipate that the previously mentioned cost actions provide us with adequate flexibility even in our most conservative scenarios. Looking at the various geographies, we believe that the U.S., India, Japan and parts of Europe are currently in the containment phase and we expect these geographies to move into recovery in the second half of the year.  We believe that China, many parts of Asia and some parts of Europe are currently in the recovery phase and while there is a possibility for a second wave of the virus, we see them on an improving trajectory.  For geographies operating within the containment phase, we expect continuing limitations to customer sites. In these areas, pharma production and QA QC activity remains stable, though we expect positives in non-essential customer spending. At the same time, many resources in pharma R&D have shifted to COVID-19-related projects.  In terms of service, we are generating revenues through a mix of direct and remote access to their facilities and we are seeing growth where customers have contracted service plans. For geographies operating in the recovery phase, we are expecting a pickup in demand for recurring revenues and some stabilization in demand for instruments.  That said, we anticipate that purchasing activity in governmental and academic markets may lag corporate customers. When geographies enter the return to growth phase, we expect recurring revenue growth to normalize and for instruments to see growth supported by the release of previously budgeted spending.  As we look through signs of recovery and growth, we are closely monitoring service calls, quoting activity, recurring revenue trends and customer capital purchasing plans. Market dynamics aside, we remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation.  Looking at the Waters\u2019 product line, new products contributed positively to our performance in Q1 including the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS and our two new tandem quads furthering our confidence in a multi-year revenue ramp for these products. Our confidence in having the right technology at the right time has been bolstered by evolving customer needs.  For example, we recently received multiple BioAccord orders from a major global pharma customer as this unique system and application set is truly fit for purpose for certain COVID-19 vaccine development and monitoring requirements.  In our TA instruments product line, the first quarter featured three important new product launches, the Discovery X3 Scanning Calorimeter, Discovery Hybrid Rheometers, and the TAM IV, Micro XL isothermal, Microcalorimeter.  Each of these instruments builds greater productivity and efficiency to the development of next-generation high-performance materials, and we believe will further enhance our innovation leadership in the thermal analysis market.  In summary, sales in our first quarter were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from China, our largest geographies were performing well until week 13, when many countries within them implemented containment measures which impacted the close to Q1 and have created uncertainty in the near-term.  That said, the Waters business model has historically proven sustainable through challenging macroeconomic environments driven by our global footprint, large install base of instruments, strong recurring revenue mix and diverse largely regulated end-markets. These factors have had a limiting impact on periods of negative revenue growth and supported consistent free cash flow in most scenarios.  We are confident that our strong balance sheet, access to capital, focus on preserving flexibility and liquidity and our robust new product flow will translate into a sustained bounce back as markets conditions allow.  With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry for a deeper review of our first quarter financials. Sherry?\nSherry Buck: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In my comments today, I will review our first quarter results and provide more details on the actions we have implemented to mitigate the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $465 million, which is down 8% against the prior year in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 2% resulting in a 10% decline as reported. Excluding China, this was more significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the quarter, constant currency sales were flat against the prior year.  As a reminder, since previous guidance for Q1 and full year results excluded any impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical markets were down 6%, our industrial category declined 7% and sales into our academic and governmental category were down 22%.  Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents the combination of service and precision chemistry was flat in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 19%. As we noted on our last earnings call, recurring revenues during the first quarter of 2020 were impacted by one less calendar day in the quarter, which resulted in a slight reduction in recurring revenue.  Looking ahead, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there are key additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Chemistry revenues were down 1% in the quarter, as weakness in academic and governmental offset pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were flat as mid-single-digit growth in service contract revenues were offset by a decline in on-demand service revenues and spare parts.  Breaking first quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services declined 9%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 4%. Combined LC and LC/MS instrument platform sales declined by 21% and TA\u2019s instrument sales declined by 5%.  Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were down 19% driven by a 45% decline in China and sales in Americas were down 5% with a 4% decline in the U.S. flat while European sales grew 4%. Excluding China, Asia was up 2%.  Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.7%, compared to 57% in the first quarter of 2019. The lower gross margin relative to the prior year was primarily driven by foreign exchange rates, and lower manufacturing fixed cost absorption. Moving down the first quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 3% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 1.5% on a reported basis. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 11.3% compared to 10.8% in the prior year as a result of discrete items in the prior year quarter.  Net interest expense was $10 million, an increase of about $7 million as anticipated. Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 14% or about 10 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year.  Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter declined to $1.15 in comparison to $1.60 last year, as a result of lower sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share declined to $0.86, compared to $1.51 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items.  In the first quarter of 2020 free cash flow came in at $121 million after funding $31 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $21 million related to investment in our new Taunton chemistry facility. In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.26 of each dollar sales converted into free cash flow.  During the quarter, we also deployed $80 million of capital relating to the acquisition of Andrew Alliance. This investment broadens our technology portfolio to include advanced robotics and software that will possibly impact our customers\u2019 workforce across pharmaceuticals, life sciences and material science markets.  In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock for $187 million in the first quarter consistent with our previously communicated buyback plan.  These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $394 million and debt of $1.9 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.5 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.9 times at the end of first quarter.  Turning to working capital, accounts receivable, days sales outstanding came in at 99 days this quarter, up compared to the first quarter of last year and inventories increased by $11 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, due to the flowing demand related to COVID-19.  Waters has a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well structured debt maturity profile. We have $1.2 billion of available liquidity at the end of first quarter inclusive of our bank revolver and about $400 million in cash and short-term investments.  Given the uncertain global business environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated impact on our business, we\u2019ve implemented a comprehensive program to reduce our cost base and have revised our capital deployment plans to better align our operations and investments with the near-term growth challenge.  I would like to walk you through these actions. From a P&L perspective, we\u2019ve taken actions to reduce our cost structure by approximately $100 million for the year. We\u2019ve reduced the base salaries of our CEO, executive committee and vice presidents as outlined in the press release issued this morning.  We\u2019ve implemented a combination of furlough, reduced work schedules and salaries actions across the organization for a 90-day period and reduced non-essential operating expenses, implemented a hiring freeze and adjusted certain benefit programs.  From a capital deployment perspective, we\u2019ve revised the current year plans to better align operations and investments with the current operating environment. These actions will improve cash flow by about $45 million of the remainder of the year. We have delayed certain capital expenditures while continuing to maintain business plan objectives.  We\u2019ve revised production plans to better align with our updated demand forecast to reduce inventory. We\u2019ve taken other actions to reduce working capital requirements. In terms of returning capital to shareholders while our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged, our immediate focus is on maintaining financial flexibility and preserving liquidity.  As a result, we have temporarily paused share repurchases until we see a more stable and predictable business environment. Additionally, we\u2019ve suspended our previous full year guidance that we shared in our Q4 earnings call to repurchase $800 million of shares during 2020.  We expect these actions will provide us with adequate flexibility and a variety of potential recovery scenarios, we are closely monitoring our business conditions and we\u2019ll adjust these action plans as appropriate.  As Chris shared earlier, this is a fluid environment related to COVID-19, we will not be providing usual financial guidance that we normally do. However, there are few data points that might be helpful for full year modeling.  Currently, currency translation is expected to decrease sales growth by about one percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about three percentage points. Net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million, primarily due to lower interest rates.  Now I would like to turn the call back to Chris for some summary comments. Chris? \nChristopher O'Connell: Thank you, Sherry. As we move through 2020 and our management of the COVID-19 crisis, we are staying focused on our long-term innovation strategy and investments that support a sustained recovery as market conditions improve. We are confident in the durability of the opportunity in our end-markets, our strong market position and our consistent strategy.  With that, we will now begin the Question-And-Answer Session. As we are not always able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Water Investor Relations team after the call. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question is Derik de Bruin - Bank of America. \nDerik de Bruin : Hi, good morning. So, can you talk a little bit more about some of the recovery in your emerging markets, just basically \u2013 just questioning \u2013 you mentioned you saw some pickup in China and some pickup in some of the other European geographies, can you talk a little bit more about that and specifically what you are seeing?\nChristopher O'Connell: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Derek and hope you are well. We have established a really robust framework for how to think about recovery, and as you might imagine it\u2019s not a one size, fits all approach. Every geography is really undergoing a different dynamic as it relates to two primary dimensions of recovery.  One is the overall spread of the virus, and what the local public health response is, and the other dimension being the knockout effects of that approach to the local economic conditions, and there\u2019s obviously a wide range of programs around the world. China, which went through this first, I would characterize as seeing a steady recovery that continues to gain traction at this point in time, about 90% of our customers in the pharmaceutical sector have restarted production, and there has been a very phased approach affecting both the customer operations as well as even our own offices and employees as they go serve.  There are some geographies that have bounced back more quickly. If you look at Korea as an example, which actually is now our number five country in the world. As you know from the papers, they had a very assertive testing policy and program early in the process, and they are really back almost in the return to growth phase.  The European countries I referred to, Europe is very much a mix bag. Some countries, including the UK and countries in Southern Europe like Spain, Italy, and France are very much still in containment, while other countries in Central Europe and even Eastern Europe, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, et cetera are more in a recovery phase.  Again, very, very local dynamics there. It\u2019s also hard to categorize them in emerging and developed for the reason I just stated in Europe, but also another example of an emerging market that was actually doing very, very well in Q1 until the end of the quarter was India where India as you know, at that point in time, in the last week of March went into severe lockdown mode. They still are in that mode.  And so, while India had a very strong start to the year, they are very quiet now and hopefully, those measures will be effective in hastening their recovery in the back half of the year. So, it\u2019s really quite different depending on where you are in the world and our model looks at a number of scenarios, a base case scenario, a conservative scenario and an optimistic scenario for each country around the world depending on where they are in those recovery phases.  And obviously, most of our focus is on the base case and the conservative case in terms of our modeling and cost actions, not spending too much time on the optimistic scenario. Otherwise, though in the case where opportunity materializes faster, we are prepared to take advantage of that. So, it just requires a very agile management process and we feel good about the way we are approaching it. \nDerik de Bruin : Great. And just one follow up if I may. Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with your chemical and some of your industrial customers, just as obviously we are approaching recession, it looks like we're going be in a recession scenario, how are they thinking to sort of beyond the initial COVID impact?  Are you seeing people pulling back heavily on their CapEx plans there? Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. \nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. Thanks, Derek. It\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, on the industrial side. As you know about half of our industrial business is food and environmental, and environmental piece that\u2019s actually been recently robust through this and about half of this is the material science, the chemical and polymer piece.  Overall, the industrial category for us in the quarter was down about the same as pharma, and the mix of that was China taking a bigger hit, U.S. down in that mid-single-digit range, actually Europe grew on the industrial side in the quarter. And so, it is a little bit of a mixed bag. We are seeing some industrial customers hold back.  We don't really see many outright closures per se. And we have seen some investment on the polymer side. These markets were pretty soft last year, and we believe there is some pent-up demand and we are actually seeing, I would say, reasonable tone in the industrial end-markets. Although, as you know, those markets are a lot more instrument-oriented with less recurring revenue, particularly in the TA instruments side.  So, watching it carefully. But at this point, it\u2019s probably too hard to overly generalize. There is pockets of strength and weakness there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Arias, Stifel. Your line is open. \nDaniel Arias : Good morning guys. Thanks. Chris, on the pharma side, can you just talk a little bit about how things look if you separate out the large molecule which I think it\u2019s about 30% or so of the mix from small molecule. And then, what your expectations look like if you are just trying to assess the components of pharma demand this year by pipeline?\nChristopher O'Connell: Sure. Yes, so, pharma \u2013 thanks, Dan. I hope you are well. The \u2013 on the pharma side of the business, which is a little more than half of our revenue, and as you correctly pointed out, it\u2019s about a 70:30 split. We were actually seeing really solid pharma business through the week 12. We were up in the mid-single digits on both the small mol and large mol little bit better.  So some decent start to the year before a lot of the containment activities outside of China, that is those numbers are outside of China. China obviously is a real outlier for the quarter. And so, the way we are looking at that is, the manufacturing, QA QC part of the business, we\u2019ve seen continued operations, we\u2019ve seen growth in QA QC outside of China. We\u2019ve seen fairly steady recurring revenues although more growth where we have contracted service plans and where there is more full production. Some QA QC has been on split shifts or rationalized capacity. We see that in the contract segment as well. But we are basically expecting to see reasonable \u2013 reasonably stable conditions on the QA QC side.  On the innovation side, much R&D does continue. Some of it has been devoted to COVID. As you know, there is more than 200 trials underway for COVID-19 therapies and up to a 100 different vaccine programs out there right now, six of which are already in trial. So, as I alluded to in my remarks, we\u2019ve seen some nice response in that segment.  Obviously, China is a big part of the overall pharma picture and that\u2019s certainly colored our Q1 results. But, we feel \u2013 we are glad that we have such a nice concentration of pharma in our overall portfolio and expect that to be a reasonably stable market as we move through this and improve over the course of the year. \nDaniel Arias : Okay. I appreciate that color. And then, Sherry, any help you can offer in terms of the extent to which the $100 million will flow through R&D versus SG&A? And then, on the $100 million, is there a back half weighting that we should think about for the cost savings or you are looking to have the portion of the cost structure in the current quarter and match when you are trying to do overall? How aggressive you\u2019ve been in 2Q?\nSherry Buck : Thanks. Happy to answer that. So, the cost actions we\u2019ve put in place, a lot of them related to employee-related actions from salaries, furloughs, work schedules really trying to right-size particularly in the second quarter as we expect it to be more challenging likely than Q1. And then other non-essential cost that we can defer.  So the $100 million in cost actions, the base against that is really can start internal plan that we\u2019ve been working on for the year 2020. The savings with flow through about three quarters of the flow through operating expenses and about a quarter of it was flow through of cost of goods sold.  As far as the timing, we did see some benefit of it in Q1 and we see \u2013 plan to see about a third of those cost actions flow through in Q2, kind of that 90-day period we talked about with some of the actions, and that would flow into a little bit of Q3, but then the remainder of it would be in the second half. \nDaniel Arias : Okay. Thanks very much to you all guys.\nChristopher O'Connell: Thanks, Dan. Next question please. \nOperator: Next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. \nTycho Peterson: Hey, good morning. Chris, you haven\u2019t preannounced six of the last seven which is I think, but given the magnitude of the unique environment and the fact most of your peers did preannounce, I am just curious why you didn\u2019t feel this was warranted to get out there ahead of the call?  And then secondly, as we think about China, I appreciate the color. Can you just talk a little bit more on pharma versus food in China and instruments and consumables maybe a little bit more color on to the end-markets? And then, any color you can provide on April trends in the U.S. and Europe relative to last two weeks of March? \nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. Thanks, Tycho. As you know, it\u2019s been a very fluid environment here and as we noted in our Q4 earnings call, we didn\u2019t include any impact of COVID in our guidance. And as I mentioned before, other than China, which I think we all knew was in a challenging environment in Q1. We were actually operating within our plans really through almost until the end of the quarter.  And so, as we closed the books, we just felt it would be better to issue our results when we saw the biggest and fullest picture possible, both what happened in the quarter and our expectations going forward and try to incorporate all the different steps we are taking to navigate the environment. And so, that\u2019s why we took the approach we took.  In terms of China and color on some of the different categories, pharma, if you look at the overall China result of down 45%, pharma was roughly in that range. Pharma is about half of our business there. The food business suffered primarily because a lot of the import export restrictions that went into place put a bit of a hold on laboratory type activity.  And so, food was down in similar ranges and academic and government obviously was the area of greatest weakness in China as a lot of universities were closed for the bulk of the quarter and the government was delaying tenders and we do expect that government environment where there is quite a bit of food business as well to continue to remain soft as the country looks at recovery, that recovery should be led by the more of the industrial corporate sector, particularly the pharmaceutical business.  In terms of the instruments and the recurring revenues, we saw an impact on both parts of that business. Certainly, to the extent we were serving customers and operating facilities and had access we were able to maintain some recurring revenues although as you know that the contracted service plans are less of a mix in China than they are in other parts of the world.  So, we saw it also in the on-demand service and in the parts \u2013 spare parts business. But China went through a pretty significant lockdown where a lot of activity went on hold and that activity is coming back as I mentioned, which is steadily being managed very tops down in that environment, in that operating environment and we expect to improve directionally in Q2 and recover more fully in the back half of the year. \nTycho Peterson: And then, on the $100 million in cost out, obviously, a lot of that\u2019s focused on salaries and some of the hourly workforce. Can you just give us comfort that that\u2019s not going to impact some of the growth initiatives given that you've moved share loss in the past? How do we get comfortable that you are not cutting into potential growth opportunities going forward?\nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. That was our guiding principle of course. We wanted to match some of our spending needs. We made some calculations as I alluded to for in a conservative scenario, how do we maintain the financial flexibility that we\u2019ve always enjoyed.  And so we modeled some numbers for the year and said how we pull that into a short concentrated period and we looked at programs both capital and projects that were going well that we had an ability to still meet our objectives on and just take a temporary pause. And obviously, shared the burden of salary reductions or hours reductions across much of the workforce.  But one of our guiding principles has been to sustain the momentum we have in new product commercialization and in fact, we believe we\u2019ve found ways not just to sustain our near-term pipeline, but actually to enhance it for benefit, to give us benefit in the second half of the year. And so, we\u2019ve taken a very, very thoughtful approach.  We took time to do it the right way. And we\u2019ve stayed very, very close to our entire employee base and with tons of communication and context and feel good about the balance that we\u2019ve struck there. But our growth initiatives \u2013 our primary growth initiatives are very much intact and as I alluded to in the remarks, our products portfolio, particularly on the mass spec sided, where we had acknowledged some share pressure in recent years is doing very well, actually very well in Q4.  It led our performance through much of the first quarter until the containment measures hit in and when we look at our pipeline strength in the future, we do see the benefit of our new products.  Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Company. \nDouglas Schenkel : Hey, good morning everybody and glad to hear you are doing well. So, you talked about holding back on working capital spends. I am thinking that in building less inventory. If we were to move into recovery quickly than expected which would obviously be great news for all of us, is there any concern that you wouldn\u2019t be optimally positioned to play offense and along those lines, your working assumption that instrument revenue that you expected in the first half.  But it isn\u2019t coming in due to the pandemic isn\u2019t necessarily going to come back in the second half as customers work through challenges and the hangover associated with what\u2019s going on right now?\nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. Sure. Doug, happy to it. We think we have a lot of room on our inventory and I\u2019ll let Sherry add to this if she like. But the inventory management piece is certainly prioritizing making sure we have plenty of capacity in some of the faster moving technologies once where we have visibility to pipeline.  So, we match our inventory goals and inventory reduction goals as needed against dynamics in terms of where we expect our pipeline to be. So even with some of the smart working capital spend management, we think we will be perfectly able to be responsive and to play offense in fact if conditions allow.  And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve actually, as I alluded to before, assembled an optimistic case scenario. So while we are focused more on our base case for planning and our conservative case for liquidity management, and financial flexibility, we do have our eye on what that would look like and make sure that we wouldn\u2019t miss a beat should things improve a little bit faster.  Relative to the second part of your question, Doug, where instruments got that we expected in the first quarter or even in the second quarter, given the near-term caution or less likely \u2013 we really believe at all of our pipeline analysis says that those are delays not cancellations.  We still think that when we look at our quoting activity in our sales pipeline, in our order book, while they do reflect that near-term caution in general, I\u2019d say, in particularly on our pharmaceutical customers there is an optimism about the future and an intent to returning to investing for growth in the foreseeable future.  Obviously, we\u2019ll update that as we move through the year. But we see more of a pause in that spending and don\u2019t have any real evidence of any cancellation type activity in scale. \nDouglas Schenkel : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Regarding recurring revenue, I mean, that was nearly flat in the quarter. I know there were some pressure in geographies beyond China late in the quarter.  I am just wondering along those lines, if you\u2019d be willing to quantify how recurring revenue trended real late in March globally and early April and if there is any ability to use that as a launching pattern to how you are thinking about recurring revenue specifically in the second quarter essentially, have things kind of at least leveled off at late April levels. Thank you. \nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. So, I\u2019ll just maybe a little bit of color on that, thanks. Yes, the recurring revenues for the quarter were flattish as you mentioned and we are trending better than that towards the end of the quarter. We normally do have purchasing activity at the end of the quarter on consumables just as we do on instruments, not to the degree, but that definitely affected it and it\u2019s a little bit of a mixed bag on recurring revenue from the standpoint of service.  There is two big pieces of the service there. There is contract service plans where we are seeing consistent growth at normal historical levels and then you have the on-demand service which includes spare parts in a meaningful way where as our service engineers can\u2019t access many customer sites. We obviously have that weakness in those areas.  And so, in general, the early patterns in April reflected sort of where we were towards the end of the quarter particularly in our largest geographies outside of China whereas China we are seeing clear evidence of our increasing access of our service engineers into customer accounts over time here on an upward slope.  We\u2019ve seen continued containment measures in some of the other parts of the world. So I think that dynamic of a mix between contracted service plans, on-demand chemistry heavily utilized in certain areas and held back in other areas. What will probably persist for a little while here into the quarter and we\u2019ll certainly update you on that as we get more information next quarter. \nOperator: Our next question is from Vijay Kumar, Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, maybe to start up, but I don\u2019t think I heard you guys mention the exit rate in ex China. I know you mentioned fourth week of March was clearly worse. But what\u2019s at the bottom, have you seen the rest of the world wages stabilize at those levels or April trends are perhaps coming in better or worse?  Any comments on the exit rate I think would be helpful?\nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. Thanks, Vijay for the question. Appreciate it. I don\u2019t think we want to overly \u2013 get overly pr\u00e9cised on early trends in April. As you know, our first month of our quarter is the lightest of the three.  In general terms, my comments earlier were that, China and parts of Asia, even parts of Europe have seen an improving trend whereas the U.S., other parts of Europe, India have seen the continuation of the type of containment measures.  So, it\u2019s really all about \u2013 as we get deeper into the second quarter, it will really be about the restrictions, the lifting of restrictions promulgated by both governments as well as corporate policy in terms of getting people back to work and scaling up production in facilities and that\u2019s going to look different in pharma companies and contract companies and industrial companies.  And so, I don\u2019t want to put too much credence in early April results, other than we expect for the immediate near-term some continuation of what we saw towards the end of the quarter with some of the improvements noted. \nVijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe as a follow-up to that, when you look at the end-markets, we\u2019ve heard perhaps some hoarding by consumers on pills respiratory drugs and anti-infective drugs and maybe pill count is going up. What is the implication of that on your \u2013 I guess, when you look at small molecule consumer business, in academic and government, is that a trend we should extrapolate from China to other parts of the world? That\u2019s materially worse in pharma. Thank you. \nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. It\u2019s a really interesting question. I think it\u2019s probably bit of a reach to try to draw too many conclusions between consumer behavior in the short-term and something like consumable usage in our business. I would look at it more as something that colors the overall pharmaceutical industry. As we look at big pharma right now, there is a lot going on.  In most cases, the production continues. There is clearly more of a focus in the pharma companies on existing drugs versus new product launches, simply because their teams can\u2019t fully get out there and launch new products. Obviously there is a COVID-19 focus with new trials with research on immune modulation and biomarker analysis.  But clearly, some of the stay at home type orders have resulted in fewer doctor visits for normal routine type healthcare and medical therapies. And to some degrees that\u2019s coloring big pharma\u2019s mindset as they navigate through this process.  So, but to boil that all the way back to consumables, I\u2019d say, our consumables revenue and to some extent as well the instruments purchases are reflecting more of just the caution that that most of our customers are taking stepping through this.  But I will say that, every single one of our customers we\u2019ve stayed very active with even if remote, we\u2019ve had extremely positive interactions with them and had some real breakthroughs in terms of how to serve them effectively at a distance. \nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Brennan, UBS. \nDaniel Brennan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Chris and Sherry and Bryan. Chris, I wanted to ask you, I know you pull guidance for 2020 obviously, and you\u2019ve given a bunch of color regarding trends between geographies and kind of customers.  And I am wondering, given you did discuss several scenarios that you are kind of mapping for different customers and geographies, is there a range or is there any way to think about a broader range of outcomes in 2Q?  Obviously, you're not going to give us a single data \u2013 a single number for guidance. But I am wondering if there is any kind of broad range that you could kind offer or speak to about how we should think about that.\nChristopher O'Connell: I think, we\u2019d probably want to stay short of that, Dan, for now, I\u2019d rather just provide qualitative description of how we are thinking about those ranges. Obviously, a base case type of scenario where we have more of an expected progression of these countries through recovery \u2013 sorry, containment recovery and return to growth.  In a conservative case scenario where if we see the persisting low level for demand for instruments and high levels of containments and obviously building our financial plans off of a conservative scenario and then in optimistic case, to say, hey what if it comes back faster and there is some pent-up demand that materializes sooner.  Those are just qualitatively how we are looking at it. At this point, I think it\u2019s premature to spend too much time describing what those numbers look like and we will obviously try to do more than as we move through the year.  But as I alluded to in my remarks, we\u2019ve seen periods of macroeconomic pressure historically in different scenarios and we have always benefited from the underlying strengths and demand characteristics in the end-markets that we choose to focus on. And so, we are planning for a solid rebound when market conditions allow. \nDaniel Brennan : Okay. Great. And then, maybe just on the industrial end-market, you had a comment earlier that sounded fairly, I am not saying constructive, but didn\u2019t sound like the expectation would be that things would worsen materially. I am just wondering, could you break down a little bit within industrial?  Your exposure to chemical, given what's going on with oil prices and spreads and environmental, I believe you had a favorable comment about the trends in the quarter and obviously, broadly for thermal for TAs.  Maybe if you could us a little flavor for what's going on within industrial? And does the 2008, 2009 experience with how your broader industrial business performed, has that sort of predicated it at all? Or is the business mix just too different to use that to kind of help us think about the impact in 2020 and 2021?\nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. I know, it\u2019s a really interesting thing to dig into. The industrial category is about 30% of total revenues, which is in rough terms, half and half between food and environmental and material science. Material science tends to be the more cyclical piece and the majority of that is chemicals and polymers.  We\u2019ve seen, I mean, the chemicals side of the business is smaller piece, polymer is the bigger piece , especially advanced polymers and we\u2019ve seen sort of okay customer activity in that area. The chemical area is generally smaller and it\u2019s probably too hard at this point for us to draw a direct correlation between what's going on in some of the energy markets in that right now.  TA is the biggest piece of the materials as you know and it\u2019s more affected than Waters generally with fewer recurring revenue sales, capital equipment sales are 80% of that. And we have seen more cyclicality in that business as you know, although we feel really well positioned in that area. I mentioned three new products that are exciting in TA.  We have the strength of the Discovery line. We\u2019ve got a gradually improving mix towards high tech, high performance materials, pharma and even consumer products. And so, I think we are better positioned in the materials sector relative to where we have been historically and even some of our peer groups, because of some of the investments we\u2019ve made there.  So, we are watching it carefully. Obviously expecting the pharma part of the business to lead the recovery as it happens. But feel very good about our overall materials, material science, industrial portfolio. Like I mentioned the food could be pretty lumpy especially with the big concentration in China.  And on the materials side, we have seen actually some reasonable demand through cycles in recent years with a lot of what we are doing on applications, PPOs and other type of applications that have been invested in by governments and municipalities. We probably have time for one more question please.\nOperator: Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nBrandon Couillard : Hey thanks. Good morning. Just two questions, Chris. Could you touch on government academic trends geographically? Was that end-markets fairly weak throughout the period? Did it see a more precipitous fall-off towards the end of the quarter? And then, could you just remind us in terms of your service mix of the break down between contracting versus break fix and spare parts?\nChristopher O'Connell: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Appreciate the questions. And first of all, in academic and government, that was the weakest of the categories as we mentioned it was geographically the most weak in China where we saw a bigger decline in the government and academic business, relative to even the overall business and that was a function of the fact that most universities were closed in China for much of the first quarter and the majority of government tenders were delayed.  So, that was a pretty clear line. And in China, historically, the academic and government business is a bigger mix of our overall business in part because of the government food labs and that's nearly a quarter of our business historically in China. So that had a big impact.  We actually saw some more \u2013 actually better performance, kind of flattish to slightly up in the U.S. in academic and government where we were doing pretty well and that did have an impact at the end of the quarter. But that business was performing reasonably well, but have limitations to customer sites in probably the immediate future.  And then, Europe was, I feel that the overall European performance of up 4% for the quarter, that was led by strong pharma, a modestly positive industrial and offset by negative on academic and government in Europe, which was a more cautious environment in that sector in the quarter.  Relative to the service contracted plans, generally run in the sort of 40%-ish plus range in the developed markets and less than that in emerging markets. So, between a third to 40% or so of our service business is in the contracted service plans with the remainder being on-demand spare parts and lines of that nature.  So, we\u2019ve continued in all those categories although, I\u2019ve seen much better performance in the contract and service side as I said. So, with that, we are at the top of the hour. Thank you everybody for your questions today and joining the call. In conclusion, as we navigate the operating environment right now, we are executing to five overriding priorities.  As I mentioned, number one, putting the health safety and well-being of our employees and customers first, number two, ensuring business continuity; number three, maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity; number four, actively planning for recovery, particularly in maximizing the benefit of our strong new product flows; and number five, contributing our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19.  We are confident in the strength of our business and we are taking a pragmatic approach to preserve our balance sheet strength and flexibility including the most significant cost actions in the history of the company. Our goal is to position Waters to recover quickly and sustainably when market conditions allow.  So on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our second quarter 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on July 28, 2020. Thanks everybody and have a great day. \nOperator: And thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Sherry Buck",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In my comments today, I will review our first quarter results and provide more details on the actions we have implemented to mitigate the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $465 million, which is down 8% against the prior year in constant currency. Currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 2% resulting in a 10% decline as reported. Excluding China, this was more significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the quarter, constant currency sales were flat against the prior year.  As a reminder, since previous guidance for Q1 and full year results excluded any impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter, sales into our pharmaceutical markets were down 6%, our industrial category declined 7% and sales into our academic and governmental category were down 22%.  Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents the combination of service and precision chemistry was flat in the quarter, while instrument sales declined 19%. As we noted on our last earnings call, recurring revenues during the first quarter of 2020 were impacted by one less calendar day in the quarter, which resulted in a slight reduction in recurring revenue.  Looking ahead, there was no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters, but there are key additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Chemistry revenues were down 1% in the quarter, as weakness in academic and governmental offset pharma growth. On the service side of our business, revenues were flat as mid-single-digit growth in service contract revenues were offset by a decline in on-demand service revenues and spare parts.  Breaking first quarter product sales down further, sales related to Waters branded products and services declined 9%, while sales of TA branded products and services declined 4%. Combined LC and LC/MS instrument platform sales declined by 21% and TA's instrument sales declined by 5%.  Looking at our growth rates in the first quarter geographically, and on a constant currency basis, sales in Asia were down 19% driven by a 45% decline in China and sales in Americas were down 5% with a 4% decline in the U.S. flat while European sales grew 4%. Excluding China, Asia was up 2%.  Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 54.7%, compared to 57% in the first quarter of 2019. The lower gross margin relative to the prior year was primarily driven by foreign exchange rates, and lower manufacturing fixed cost absorption. Moving down the first quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 3% on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation decreased operating expense growth by approximately 1.5% on a reported basis. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 11.3% compared to 10.8% in the prior year as a result of discrete items in the prior year quarter.  Net interest expense was $10 million, an increase of about $7 million as anticipated. Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, a share count reduction of approximately 14% or about 10 million shares lower than in the first quarter of last year.  Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter declined to $1.15 in comparison to $1.60 last year, as a result of lower sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share declined to $0.86, compared to $1.51 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, I'd like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding special items.  In the first quarter of 2020 free cash flow came in at $121 million after funding $31 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $21 million related to investment in our new Taunton chemistry facility. In the first quarter, this resulted in $0.26 of each dollar sales converted into free cash flow.  During the quarter, we also deployed $80 million of capital relating to the acquisition of Andrew Alliance. This investment broadens our technology portfolio to include advanced robotics and software that will possibly impact our customers' workforce across pharmaceuticals, life sciences and material science markets.  In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock for $187 million in the first quarter consistent with our previously communicated buyback plan.  These capital allocation activities, along with our free cash flow resulted in cash and short-term investments of $394 million and debt of $1.9 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $1.5 billion and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.9 times at the end of first quarter.  Turning to working capital, accounts receivable, days sales outstanding came in at 99 days this quarter, up compared to the first quarter of last year and inventories increased by $11 million in comparison to the prior year quarter, due to the flowing demand related to COVID-19.  Waters has a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well structured debt maturity profile. We have $1.2 billion of available liquidity at the end of first quarter inclusive of our bank revolver and about $400 million in cash and short-term investments.  Given the uncertain global business environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated impact on our business, we've implemented a comprehensive program to reduce our cost base and have revised our capital deployment plans to better align our operations and investments with the near-term growth challenge.  I would like to walk you through these actions. From a P&L perspective, we've taken actions to reduce our cost structure by approximately $100 million for the year. We've reduced the base salaries of our CEO, executive committee and vice presidents as outlined in the press release issued this morning.  We've implemented a combination of furlough, reduced work schedules and salaries actions across the organization for a 90-day period and reduced non-essential operating expenses, implemented a hiring freeze and adjusted certain benefit programs.  From a capital deployment perspective, we've revised the current year plans to better align operations and investments with the current operating environment. These actions will improve cash flow by about $45 million of the remainder of the year. We have delayed certain capital expenditures while continuing to maintain business plan objectives.  We've revised production plans to better align with our updated demand forecast to reduce inventory. We've taken other actions to reduce working capital requirements. In terms of returning capital to shareholders while our future capital structure target of approximately 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA remains unchanged, our immediate focus is on maintaining financial flexibility and preserving liquidity.  As a result, we have temporarily paused share repurchases until we see a more stable and predictable business environment. Additionally, we've suspended our previous full year guidance that we shared in our Q4 earnings call to repurchase $800 million of shares during 2020.  We expect these actions will provide us with adequate flexibility and a variety of potential recovery scenarios, we are closely monitoring our business conditions and we'll adjust these action plans as appropriate.  As Chris shared earlier, this is a fluid environment related to COVID-19, we will not be providing usual financial guidance that we normally do. However, there are few data points that might be helpful for full year modeling.  Currently, currency translation is expected to decrease sales growth by about one percentage point and to negatively impact earnings per share by about three percentage points. Net interest expense is expected to be in the range of $40 million to $42 million, primarily due to lower interest rates.  Now I would like to turn the call back to Chris for some summary comments. Chris? Thanks. Happy to answer that. So, the cost actions we've put in place, a lot of them related to employee-related actions from salaries, furloughs, work schedules really trying to right-size particularly in the second quarter as we expect it to be more challenging likely than Q1. And then other non-essential cost that we can defer.  So the $100 million in cost actions, the base against that is really can start internal plan that we've been working on for the year 2020. The savings with flow through about three quarters of the flow through operating expenses and about a quarter of it was flow through of cost of goods sold.  As far as the timing, we did see some benefit of it in Q1 and we see \u2013 plan to see about a third of those cost actions flow through in Q2, kind of that 90-day period we talked about with some of the actions, and that would flow into a little bit of Q3, but then the remainder of it would be in the second half."

            "name": "Christopher O'Connell",
            "content": "Thanks, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Along with Bryan Brokmeier, joining me on this morning's call is Sherry Buck, Waters' Chief Financial Officer. I hope you and your loved ones are doing well at this challenging time and staying positive as we all strive to overcome the global COVID-19 public health and macroeconomic challenge. Like most of you, we are all working from home, so please bear with us if we encounter any unforeseen audio issues with today's call.  During today's call, I will provide an overview of our first quarter operating results as well as some broader commentary on the impact that COVID-19 is having on our markets and businesses. Sherry will then review our financial results in detail and discuss our financial actions as it relates to the balance sheet and cost structure. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  As you well know, the COVID-19 global pandemic is a significant challenge for the world that is putting extraordinary pressure on the economy, our customers, employees, and their families. I would like to personally extend my gratitude for the hard work and dedication that everyone has shown over the past few months.  I'd especially like to thank all of our dedicated employees who have been working in our manufacturing facilities, laboratories, and distribution centers ensuring that we can supply our products and expertise to our customers.  I also want to thank our talented field service engineers who have been on the frontlines, installing and maintaining critical analytical instruments and data systems to support the ongoing work of our customers.  These efforts are incredible and truly inspire me, but they don't surprise me as I have consistently seen our great people step up to deliver benefit to our customers under all conditions.  To briefly review our operating results for the first quarter, Q1 sales declined 8% and adjusted earnings per share declined 28%. The biggest COVID-19 impact on our business in Q1 was China, which declined 45% in the quarter impacting total company sales by approximately 8 percentage points in constant currency.  As severe containment actions were implemented in China at the time of the spring festival, economic activity and demand significantly decelerated and these conditions persisted through the quarter. On a positive note, it was encouraging to see flat sales ex-China for the quarter and 4% growth ex-China through week 12 of Q1 before broader containment actions went into place in the U.S., Europe, and India.  Rapidly changing market conditions in these geographies during the final week of the quarter included declining access to customer sites as well as the inability of some customers to place and receive instrument orders.  Through four weeks of Q2, we have seen signs of recovery in China and other parts of Asia and Europe, though we expect the conditions seen at the end of Q1 in the U.S., India, and some parts of Europe will persist into Q2 making the second quarter likely more challenging than the first quarter.  As we operate in this fluid environment, we have five overriding priorities: number one, putting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and customers first; number two, ensuring business continuity; number three, maintaining financial strength, flexibility, and liquidity; number four, actively planning for recovery, particularly in maximizing the benefit of our strong new product flow; and number five, contributing our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19.  Let me say a little bit more about each of these five priorities. First, the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and our customers is our clear top priority. At every stage of the pandemic, we have taken decisive and appropriate cautions, including a mandatory remote work policy for all employees with the exception of manufacturing, distribution, and certain laboratory environments, as well as bans on non-essential travel and visitors into our facilities.  Early on, we engaged a medical advisor to guide our policy deployment and we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the health of our global employee base and the safety of all customer interactions.  Our second priority is to ensure business continuity. The vast majority of the markets we serve, most notably the pharmaceutical, biomedical research, food and environmental, and clinical markets have continued to operate at various levels, and we are working closely with these customers to ensure their seamless operation.  Over the last several years, Waters has executed on a digital workplace strategy focused on providing modern connectivity and collaboration tools to our employees. Our strategic technology investments have enabled us to swiftly meet the remote working needs as the situation has escalated.  From a customer-facing standpoint, we are leveraging digital demand generation activities, including virtual demos across all regions, remote instrument installations, virtual sales seminars, online product training, and a rapid acceleration in one-to-one communications over emails, phone, and video conferencing.  We also recently launched a new customer portal on waters.com, enabling a convenient and personalized online experience that's more mobile-friendly augmenting the recent expansion of our digital commerce capabilities. We are continuing to invest to provide our customers a similar world-class experience through digital means as they receive in person, and we are seeing great customer engagement.  From a supply chain standpoint, we have proactively and successfully secured access to raw materials for ongoing manufacturing needs, and we are working closely with our transportation providers to minimize any disruption to our distribution network. At this time, we do not anticipate any immediate supply or distribution concerns during the second quarter and are actively mitigating potential risks.  Our third priority is maintaining our financial strength, flexibility, and liquidity under a range of business scenarios. We are seeking to balance prudent management of all areas of our spend, while continuing to invest in growth initiatives.  We are taking a proactive approach to preserving balance sheet strength and liquidity, as well as to appropriately right-size our cost structure for the unpredictable months ahead. Specifically, we have paused our share repurchase program until we return to a more stable and predictable business environment.  We are also taking actions in 2020 that will reduce our cost structure by about $100 million, as well as actions that will result in about $45 million of cash flow improvement from CapEx and working capital management. Sherry will provide more details on these measures during her remarks.  Fourth, we are actively planning for a variety of recovery scenarios with particular emphasis on maximizing the impact of our exciting new product cycle, including products launched in the last year as well as new technology coming to the market this year. In the context of our cost measures, R&D investments continue to be a priority, especially those that will contribute to near-term growth.  We remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation, and as stated before, we have made durable improvements in R&D productivity positioning us well to benefit as demand normalizes and for the long-term.  Finally, while we are not assuming a material financial benefit, we have mobilized quickly to contribute our expertise and capabilities in the fight against COVID-19. We formed a COVID-19 innovation response team to bring Waters' industry-leading expertise to the forefront of the global scientific surge to quickly and effectively deliver diagnostics, therapies, and vaccines. By extending our resources to scientists that are working on the challenging biology of the virus and pursuing a range of interventions, we know that we can help accelerate the push to defeat COVID-19.  A few examples include, first, Waters has donated columns, service and instrumentation to hospital laboratories in Milan, Turin, and Rome in Italy and in Bordeaux, Leo\u0301n, Marseille and Paris in France. These donations are supporting drug monitoring and research for potential Coronavirus therapies.  Second, in the UK and Ireland, our team has been working overtime to quickly deliver specialized mass spectrometry instruments for researchers for measuring potential new COVID-19 drugs in experimental models of the SARS, COV2 infection.  And finally, we are providing our unique glycan analysis capabilities to vaccine developers. The significance of the glycosylation is the antigen is underscored by numerous recent publications on the structural biology of the SARS COV2 spike protein. We are enabling high resolution, high sensitivity and molecular glycan fingerprints in just minutes versus the days typically needed with traditional approaches.  Turing to guidance. As a result of the uncertainties surrounding the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our customers, we are withdrawing our prior 2020 guidance, which as a reminder, explicitly did not include any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, I will provide you with some color to help you better understand our current thinking. We have built a range of scenarios by categorizing each geography into one of three phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, containment, recovery and return to growth.  Importantly, we anticipate that the previously mentioned cost actions provide us with adequate flexibility even in our most conservative scenarios. Looking at the various geographies, we believe that the U.S., India, Japan and parts of Europe are currently in the containment phase and we expect these geographies to move into recovery in the second half of the year.  We believe that China, many parts of Asia and some parts of Europe are currently in the recovery phase and while there is a possibility for a second wave of the virus, we see them on an improving trajectory.  For geographies operating within the containment phase, we expect continuing limitations to customer sites. In these areas, pharma production and QA QC activity remains stable, though we expect positives in non-essential customer spending. At the same time, many resources in pharma R&D have shifted to COVID-19-related projects.  In terms of service, we are generating revenues through a mix of direct and remote access to their facilities and we are seeing growth where customers have contracted service plans. For geographies operating in the recovery phase, we are expecting a pickup in demand for recurring revenues and some stabilization in demand for instruments.  That said, we anticipate that purchasing activity in governmental and academic markets may lag corporate customers. When geographies enter the return to growth phase, we expect recurring revenue growth to normalize and for instruments to see growth supported by the release of previously budgeted spending.  As we look through signs of recovery and growth, we are closely monitoring service calls, quoting activity, recurring revenue trends and customer capital purchasing plans. Market dynamics aside, we remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation.  Looking at the Waters' product line, new products contributed positively to our performance in Q1 including the BioAccord, Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS and our two new tandem quads furthering our confidence in a multi-year revenue ramp for these products. Our confidence in having the right technology at the right time has been bolstered by evolving customer needs.  For example, we recently received multiple BioAccord orders from a major global pharma customer as this unique system and application set is truly fit for purpose for certain COVID-19 vaccine development and monitoring requirements.  In our TA instruments product line, the first quarter featured three important new product launches, the Discovery X3 Scanning Calorimeter, Discovery Hybrid Rheometers, and the TAM IV, Micro XL isothermal, Microcalorimeter.  Each of these instruments builds greater productivity and efficiency to the development of next-generation high-performance materials, and we believe will further enhance our innovation leadership in the thermal analysis market.  In summary, sales in our first quarter were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from China, our largest geographies were performing well until week 13, when many countries within them implemented containment measures which impacted the close to Q1 and have created uncertainty in the near-term.  That said, the Waters business model has historically proven sustainable through challenging macroeconomic environments driven by our global footprint, large install base of instruments, strong recurring revenue mix and diverse largely regulated end-markets. These factors have had a limiting impact on periods of negative revenue growth and supported consistent free cash flow in most scenarios.  We are confident that our strong balance sheet, access to capital, focus on preserving flexibility and liquidity and our robust new product flow will translate into a sustained bounce back as markets conditions allow.  With that, I would like to pass the call over to Sherry for a deeper review of our first quarter financials. Sherry? Thank you, Sherry. As we move through 2020 and our management of the COVID-19 crisis, we are staying focused on our long-term innovation strategy and investments that support a sustained recovery as market conditions improve. We are confident in the durability of the opportunity in our end-markets, our strong market position and our consistent strategy.  With that, we will now begin the Question-And-Answer Session. As we are not always able to get to everyone's questions, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And if you have additional questions, please contact the Water Investor Relations team after the call. Operator? Sure. Yes. Thanks, Derek and hope you are well. We have established a really robust framework for how to think about recovery, and as you might imagine it's not a one size, fits all approach. Every geography is really undergoing a different dynamic as it relates to two primary dimensions of recovery.  One is the overall spread of the virus, and what the local public health response is, and the other dimension being the knockout effects of that approach to the local economic conditions, and there's obviously a wide range of programs around the world. China, which went through this first, I would characterize as seeing a steady recovery that continues to gain traction at this point in time, about 90% of our customers in the pharmaceutical sector have restarted production, and there has been a very phased approach affecting both the customer operations as well as even our own offices and employees as they go serve.  There are some geographies that have bounced back more quickly. If you look at Korea as an example, which actually is now our number five country in the world. As you know from the papers, they had a very assertive testing policy and program early in the process, and they are really back almost in the return to growth phase.  The European countries I referred to, Europe is very much a mix bag. Some countries, including the UK and countries in Southern Europe like Spain, Italy, and France are very much still in containment, while other countries in Central Europe and even Eastern Europe, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Denmark, et cetera are more in a recovery phase.  Again, very, very local dynamics there. It's also hard to categorize them in emerging and developed for the reason I just stated in Europe, but also another example of an emerging market that was actually doing very, very well in Q1 until the end of the quarter was India where India as you know, at that point in time, in the last week of March went into severe lockdown mode. They still are in that mode.  And so, while India had a very strong start to the year, they are very quiet now and hopefully, those measures will be effective in hastening their recovery in the back half of the year. So, it's really quite different depending on where you are in the world and our model looks at a number of scenarios, a base case scenario, a conservative scenario and an optimistic scenario for each country around the world depending on where they are in those recovery phases.  And obviously, most of our focus is on the base case and the conservative case in terms of our modeling and cost actions, not spending too much time on the optimistic scenario. Otherwise, though in the case where opportunity materializes faster, we are prepared to take advantage of that. So, it just requires a very agile management process and we feel good about the way we are approaching it. Yes. Thanks, Derek. It's a bit of a mixed bag, on the industrial side. As you know about half of our industrial business is food and environmental, and environmental piece that's actually been recently robust through this and about half of this is the material science, the chemical and polymer piece.  Overall, the industrial category for us in the quarter was down about the same as pharma, and the mix of that was China taking a bigger hit, U.S. down in that mid-single-digit range, actually Europe grew on the industrial side in the quarter. And so, it is a little bit of a mixed bag. We are seeing some industrial customers hold back.  We don't really see many outright closures per se. And we have seen some investment on the polymer side. These markets were pretty soft last year, and we believe there is some pent-up demand and we are actually seeing, I would say, reasonable tone in the industrial end-markets. Although, as you know, those markets are a lot more instrument-oriented with less recurring revenue, particularly in the TA instruments side.  So, watching it carefully. But at this point, it's probably too hard to overly generalize. There is pockets of strength and weakness there. Sure. Yes, so, pharma \u2013 thanks, Dan. I hope you are well. The \u2013 on the pharma side of the business, which is a little more than half of our revenue, and as you correctly pointed out, it's about a 70:30 split. We were actually seeing really solid pharma business through the week 12. We were up in the mid-single digits on both the small mol and large mol little bit better.  So some decent start to the year before a lot of the containment activities outside of China, that is those numbers are outside of China. China obviously is a real outlier for the quarter. And so, the way we are looking at that is, the manufacturing, QA QC part of the business, we've seen continued operations, we've seen growth in QA QC outside of China. We've seen fairly steady recurring revenues although more growth where we have contracted service plans and where there is more full production. Some QA QC has been on split shifts or rationalized capacity. We see that in the contract segment as well. But we are basically expecting to see reasonable \u2013 reasonably stable conditions on the QA QC side.  On the innovation side, much R&D does continue. Some of it has been devoted to COVID. As you know, there is more than 200 trials underway for COVID-19 therapies and up to a 100 different vaccine programs out there right now, six of which are already in trial. So, as I alluded to in my remarks, we've seen some nice response in that segment.  Obviously, China is a big part of the overall pharma picture and that's certainly colored our Q1 results. But, we feel \u2013 we are glad that we have such a nice concentration of pharma in our overall portfolio and expect that to be a reasonably stable market as we move through this and improve over the course of the year. Thanks, Dan. Next question please. Yes. Thanks, Tycho. As you know, it's been a very fluid environment here and as we noted in our Q4 earnings call, we didn't include any impact of COVID in our guidance. And as I mentioned before, other than China, which I think we all knew was in a challenging environment in Q1. We were actually operating within our plans really through almost until the end of the quarter.  And so, as we closed the books, we just felt it would be better to issue our results when we saw the biggest and fullest picture possible, both what happened in the quarter and our expectations going forward and try to incorporate all the different steps we are taking to navigate the environment. And so, that's why we took the approach we took.  In terms of China and color on some of the different categories, pharma, if you look at the overall China result of down 45%, pharma was roughly in that range. Pharma is about half of our business there. The food business suffered primarily because a lot of the import export restrictions that went into place put a bit of a hold on laboratory type activity.  And so, food was down in similar ranges and academic and government obviously was the area of greatest weakness in China as a lot of universities were closed for the bulk of the quarter and the government was delaying tenders and we do expect that government environment where there is quite a bit of food business as well to continue to remain soft as the country looks at recovery, that recovery should be led by the more of the industrial corporate sector, particularly the pharmaceutical business.  In terms of the instruments and the recurring revenues, we saw an impact on both parts of that business. Certainly, to the extent we were serving customers and operating facilities and had access we were able to maintain some recurring revenues although as you know that the contracted service plans are less of a mix in China than they are in other parts of the world.  So, we saw it also in the on-demand service and in the parts \u2013 spare parts business. But China went through a pretty significant lockdown where a lot of activity went on hold and that activity is coming back as I mentioned, which is steadily being managed very tops down in that environment, in that operating environment and we expect to improve directionally in Q2 and recover more fully in the back half of the year. Yes. That was our guiding principle of course. We wanted to match some of our spending needs. We made some calculations as I alluded to for in a conservative scenario, how do we maintain the financial flexibility that we've always enjoyed.  And so we modeled some numbers for the year and said how we pull that into a short concentrated period and we looked at programs both capital and projects that were going well that we had an ability to still meet our objectives on and just take a temporary pause. And obviously, shared the burden of salary reductions or hours reductions across much of the workforce.  But one of our guiding principles has been to sustain the momentum we have in new product commercialization and in fact, we believe we've found ways not just to sustain our near-term pipeline, but actually to enhance it for benefit, to give us benefit in the second half of the year. And so, we've taken a very, very thoughtful approach.  We took time to do it the right way. And we've stayed very, very close to our entire employee base and with tons of communication and context and feel good about the balance that we've struck there. But our growth initiatives \u2013 our primary growth initiatives are very much intact and as I alluded to in the remarks, our products portfolio, particularly on the mass spec sided, where we had acknowledged some share pressure in recent years is doing very well, actually very well in Q4.  It led our performance through much of the first quarter until the containment measures hit in and when we look at our pipeline strength in the future, we do see the benefit of our new products.  Next question please? Yes. Sure. Doug, happy to it. We think we have a lot of room on our inventory and I'll let Sherry add to this if she like. But the inventory management piece is certainly prioritizing making sure we have plenty of capacity in some of the faster moving technologies once where we have visibility to pipeline.  So, we match our inventory goals and inventory reduction goals as needed against dynamics in terms of where we expect our pipeline to be. So even with some of the smart working capital spend management, we think we will be perfectly able to be responsive and to play offense in fact if conditions allow.  And that's why we've actually, as I alluded to before, assembled an optimistic case scenario. So while we are focused more on our base case for planning and our conservative case for liquidity management, and financial flexibility, we do have our eye on what that would look like and make sure that we wouldn't miss a beat should things improve a little bit faster.  Relative to the second part of your question, Doug, where instruments got that we expected in the first quarter or even in the second quarter, given the near-term caution or less likely \u2013 we really believe at all of our pipeline analysis says that those are delays not cancellations.  We still think that when we look at our quoting activity in our sales pipeline, in our order book, while they do reflect that near-term caution in general, I'd say, in particularly on our pharmaceutical customers there is an optimism about the future and an intent to returning to investing for growth in the foreseeable future.  Obviously, we'll update that as we move through the year. But we see more of a pause in that spending and don't have any real evidence of any cancellation type activity in scale. Yes. So, I'll just maybe a little bit of color on that, thanks. Yes, the recurring revenues for the quarter were flattish as you mentioned and we are trending better than that towards the end of the quarter. We normally do have purchasing activity at the end of the quarter on consumables just as we do on instruments, not to the degree, but that definitely affected it and it's a little bit of a mixed bag on recurring revenue from the standpoint of service.  There is two big pieces of the service there. There is contract service plans where we are seeing consistent growth at normal historical levels and then you have the on-demand service which includes spare parts in a meaningful way where as our service engineers can't access many customer sites. We obviously have that weakness in those areas.  And so, in general, the early patterns in April reflected sort of where we were towards the end of the quarter particularly in our largest geographies outside of China whereas China we are seeing clear evidence of our increasing access of our service engineers into customer accounts over time here on an upward slope.  We've seen continued containment measures in some of the other parts of the world. So I think that dynamic of a mix between contracted service plans, on-demand chemistry heavily utilized in certain areas and held back in other areas. What will probably persist for a little while here into the quarter and we'll certainly update you on that as we get more information next quarter. Yes. Thanks, Vijay for the question. Appreciate it. I don't think we want to overly \u2013 get overly pre\u0301cised on early trends in April. As you know, our first month of our quarter is the lightest of the three.  In general terms, my comments earlier were that, China and parts of Asia, even parts of Europe have seen an improving trend whereas the U.S., other parts of Europe, India have seen the continuation of the type of containment measures.  So, it's really all about \u2013 as we get deeper into the second quarter, it will really be about the restrictions, the lifting of restrictions promulgated by both governments as well as corporate policy in terms of getting people back to work and scaling up production in facilities and that's going to look different in pharma companies and contract companies and industrial companies.  And so, I don't want to put too much credence in early April results, other than we expect for the immediate near-term some continuation of what we saw towards the end of the quarter with some of the improvements noted. Yes. It's a really interesting question. I think it's probably bit of a reach to try to draw too many conclusions between consumer behavior in the short-term and something like consumable usage in our business. I would look at it more as something that colors the overall pharmaceutical industry. As we look at big pharma right now, there is a lot going on.  In most cases, the production continues. There is clearly more of a focus in the pharma companies on existing drugs versus new product launches, simply because their teams can't fully get out there and launch new products. Obviously there is a COVID-19 focus with new trials with research on immune modulation and biomarker analysis.  But clearly, some of the stay at home type orders have resulted in fewer doctor visits for normal routine type healthcare and medical therapies. And to some degrees that's coloring big pharma's mindset as they navigate through this process.  So, but to boil that all the way back to consumables, I'd say, our consumables revenue and to some extent as well the instruments purchases are reflecting more of just the caution that that most of our customers are taking stepping through this.  But I will say that, every single one of our customers we've stayed very active with even if remote, we've had extremely positive interactions with them and had some real breakthroughs in terms of how to serve them effectively at a distance. I think, we'd probably want to stay short of that, Dan, for now, I'd rather just provide qualitative description of how we are thinking about those ranges. Obviously, a base case type of scenario where we have more of an expected progression of these countries through recovery \u2013 sorry, containment recovery and return to growth.  In a conservative case scenario where if we see the persisting low level for demand for instruments and high levels of containments and obviously building our financial plans off of a conservative scenario and then in optimistic case, to say, hey what if it comes back faster and there is some pent-up demand that materializes sooner.  Those are just qualitatively how we are looking at it. At this point, I think it's premature to spend too much time describing what those numbers look like and we will obviously try to do more than as we move through the year.  But as I alluded to in my remarks, we've seen periods of macroeconomic pressure historically in different scenarios and we have always benefited from the underlying strengths and demand characteristics in the end-markets that we choose to focus on. And so, we are planning for a solid rebound when market conditions allow. Yes. I know, it's a really interesting thing to dig into. The industrial category is about 30% of total revenues, which is in rough terms, half and half between food and environmental and material science. Material science tends to be the more cyclical piece and the majority of that is chemicals and polymers.  We've seen, I mean, the chemicals side of the business is smaller piece, polymer is the bigger piece , especially advanced polymers and we've seen sort of okay customer activity in that area. The chemical area is generally smaller and it's probably too hard at this point for us to draw a direct correlation between what's going on in some of the energy markets in that right now.  TA is the biggest piece of the materials as you know and it's more affected than Waters generally with fewer recurring revenue sales, capital equipment sales are 80% of that. And we have seen more cyclicality in that business as you know, although we feel really well positioned in that area. I mentioned three new products that are exciting in TA.  We have the strength of the Discovery line. We've got a gradually improving mix towards high tech, high performance materials, pharma and even consumer products. And so, I think we are better positioned in the materials sector relative to where we have been historically and even some of our peer groups, because of some of the investments we've made there.  So, we are watching it carefully. Obviously expecting the pharma part of the business to lead the recovery as it happens. But feel very good about our overall materials, material science, industrial portfolio. Like I mentioned the food could be pretty lumpy especially with the big concentration in China.  And on the materials side, we have seen actually some reasonable demand through cycles in recent years with a lot of what we are doing on applications, PPOs and other type of applications that have been invested in by governments and municipalities. We probably have time for one more question please. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Appreciate the questions. And first of all, in academic and government, that was the weakest of the categories as we mentioned it was geographically the most weak in China where we saw a bigger decline in the government and academic business, relative to even the overall business and that was a function of the fact that most universities were closed in China for much of the first quarter and the majority of government tenders were delayed.  So, that was a pretty clear line. And in China, historically, the academic and government business is a bigger mix of our overall business in part because of the government food labs and that's nearly a quarter of our business historically in China. So that had a big impact.  We actually saw some more \u2013 actually better performance, kind of flattish to slightly up in the U.S. in academic and government where we were doing pretty well and that did have an impact at the end of the quarter. But that business was performing reasonably well, but have limitations to customer sites in probably the immediate future.  And then, Europe was, I feel that the overall European performance of up 4% for the quarter, that was led by strong pharma, a modestly positive industrial and offset by negative on academic and government in Europe, which was a more cautious environment in that sector in the quarter.  Relative to the service contracted plans, generally run in the sort of 40%-ish plus range in the developed markets and less than that in emerging markets. So, between a third to 40% or so of our service business is in the contracted service plans with the remainder being on-demand spare parts and lines of that nature.  So, we've continued in all those categories although, I've seen much better performance in the contract and service side as I said. So, with that, we are at the top of the hour. Thank you everybody for your questions today and joining the call. In conclusion, as we navigate the operating environment right now, we are executing to five overriding priorities.  As I mentioned, number one, putting the health safety and well-being of our employees and customers first, number two, ensuring business continuity; number three, maintaining financial strength, flexibility and liquidity; number four, actively planning for recovery, particularly in maximizing the benefit of our strong new product flows; and number five, contributing our expertise and capabilities in the global fight against COVID-19.  We are confident in the strength of our business and we are taking a pragmatic approach to preserve our balance sheet strength and flexibility including the most significant cost actions in the history of the company. Our goal is to position Waters to recover quickly and sustainably when market conditions allow.  So on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our second quarter 2020 call, which we currently anticipate holding on July 28, 2020. Thanks everybody and have a great day."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters President and CEO, Udit.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning\u2019s call is Amol Chaubal, Waters Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've ended a very successful year at Waters. In end markets with sustainable growth drivers, we have revived our resilient business and are now focused on growing our portfolio. Despite higher comparables, we saw strong growth continue with an acceleration on a stacked basis as the year went on. The strength we've seen in our instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for the future, as our new products have gained traction and this all supports the sustainable future growth we expect to see in our consumables and service. Before summarizing the quarter and full year, let me start by thanking my colleagues around the globe who represented the indomitable spirit of Waters throughout 2021, remain focused on supporting our customers and delivering exciting new products despite the challenging conditions of the pandemic. Achieving these results in a normal year would have been quite an accomplishment but to do so while balancing the continued ups and downs of the pandemic with a major transformation and a new leadership team is indeed quite remarkable. Now I'm turning to Slide 3, we have three messages. We have a resilient and attractive portfolio of instruments systems, chemistry, consumables and services in end markets that are supported by sustainable growth drivers. We revitalize the score by engaging our customers progressing on a number of growth initiatives and continuing to innovate across our portfolio while launching exciting new products. And now we're focused on growth of our core business as well as accessing high-volume applications and faster-growing adjacencies. I will now provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone line to take your questions. Moving on to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 6% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad strength across our end markets and geographies with double-digit year-end demand for our instruments and continued growth in our recurring revenue products. This translates to a 7.5% two-year stacked CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue grew 18% as reported and 16% in constant currency as we saw strong growth in 2021 across all our regions led by pharma and industrial end markets. This translates to a 7% two years stacked CAGR for the year versus 2019 in constant currency. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.67 per share, up 1% year-on-year and 7% stacked. Excluding the effect of our prior year COVID cost actions and FX, EPS grew 8% versus last year. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $11.20 and 12% on a two-year stacked basis. Now looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5. In constant currency first, by operating segment, the Waters division grew 7%, while TA grew 16%. The end market, our largest market category, pharma grew 8%, industrial grew 7% and academic and government grew at 5%. In pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength in sales across segments, geographies and applications. Biopharma and contract organizations grew well above 20%. In industrial, growth was led by our TA business, which saw strong global strength in thermal as well as microcalorimetry and rheology. Within the Waters division, we saw broad demand for LC instruments across our geographies as well as our customers, as well as our customer segments who continue to invest in new capital equipment. Turning to academic and government, we saw an improvement with growth across most of our geographies into the year-end. We're actively revitalizing our relationships with KOLs, which is an integral part of achieving long-term success in academic and government. While it takes some time for us to regain traction, Waters has familiarity and a fan base amongst KOLs, who have often used instruments throughout their careers. Just last week, I was talking with the head of a leading core lab at one of our \u2013 one of the top medical institutions in the United States. He has worked closely with Waters for the better part of two decades to build up proteomics capabilities at this institution and currently has over 40 Waters LCs and 20 mass spec instruments from our company. Moving now, to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 9% with China up 13%, Americas 8%, with U.S. up 8% and Europe grew 5%. In China, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter with growth led by contractors, biopharma and a strong recovery in clinical. We also saw strong growth in food testing and chemical assays. In the U.S. growth came from ongoing strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. In pharma, sales was strong in LC and mass spec, which combined grew in the mid-teens with chemistry up low double digits. In industrial, our TA business saw strong instrument placement across applications, led by advanced materials, chemicals and battery testing. In Europe, all end markets continued to grow led by pharma and industrial with food and environmental businesses, resulting in strong demand for our Tandem Quads. Meanwhile, pharma sales remained solid with growth led by large molecule applications. By product and services, customer demand for our instruments finished the year strong, continuing the trend of instrument growth that we saw throughout the year, while demand for recurring revenue products remained strong. Overall instrument sales grew 12% for the quarter with a robust demand driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. In LC, Arc HPLC continued to see strong global growth in our core segments as demand continues to ramp. Meanwhile, our acuity and arc premier instruments continued to see strong adoption, driven by applications in large molecule and novel modality such as mRNA. In mass spec, we saw growth in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, led by Xevo TQ-XS, Xevo TQ-XS micro. We also saw strong demand from our biopharma and CRO customers as well as for food safety applications. In our high risk mass spec portfolio, we saw the demand for cyclic with drug discovery applications. We're also encouraged by the early adoption of our new, SELECT SERIES MRT, Time-of-Fight platform, the customers using it for biopharma discovery and OMEX applications. For recurring revenues, despite the quarter having six fewer days in the fourth quarter of 2020, chemistry sales grew 5%, led by continued high utilization biopharma customers. Our new MaxPeak, Premier Columns continued to provide incremental growth for our chemistry business. This technology provides important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans, which is effectively answering the needs of our customers as they work with more complex molecules. Service grew to 2% despite a tough double-digit comparison a year ago with strong growth in both China and in India, which has been a theme throughout the year. Finally, TA had another great quarter, with sales up 16% led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong in all regions, the growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals including batteries and electronics. Looking now, at our top line results for the full year on Slide 6, in constant currency, the Waters division grew 15%, while TA grew 25%. By end market, pharma grew 19% and industrial grew 15%, while academic and government came at 5% for the year. Pharma which is our largest market has grown 10% on a two-year stack basis driven by strong demand in our instruments and recurring revenues with strength in both large and small molecule applications. We've also seen ongoing strength in our industrial and applied market, which has grown 6% on a two-year stack basis led by China as well as North America and Europe. In academic and government, which has been our slowest market to recover sales in Europe and the U.S. are close to pre-pandemic levels as China has further in its recovery as university spending continues to be constrained. By geography, Asia grew 19%, China growing 25%, Americas grew at 16% with the U.S. growing at 14% and Europe also grew 14%. For the full year on a two-year stack basis, our three largest geographies, the U.S. China and Europe was 6%, 7% and 8% respectively. What is especially pleasing is that the demand is balanced across all geographies including a robust recovery in the U.S. By products and services, instruments grew 23% for the year, chemistry 15% and service grew 9%. On a stack basis instruments grew 6%, chemistry 9% and service 6%, showing strong performance above our historical averages. The strength we've seen in our LC instrument portfolio throughout the year remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables as well as service. Our growth in recurring revenues has also been supported by the progress we've made in ecommerce as well as delivering higher attachment rates in service. Given the global nature of our business, we're certainly not immune to the ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. But we are proactively addressing these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers. Now moving on to Slide #7. We covered this in our Q3 earnings call and also at the recent JPMorgan conference. Our initiatives across instrument replacement, service attachment, contract organizations, ecommerce and new product launch excellence have all been important components for us to gaining our momentum and delivering strong performance in 2021. We've continued to exceed expectations and milestones on these initiatives and believe that each has further one way not just in 2022 but in years beyond providing an average incremental growth impact of roughly 100 basis points annually across the base business in the next two to three years, as our transformation program is firmly on track. Moving now on to Slide 8. The strength of our business is being supported by instrument innovation with recent product launches that have revitalized our core. Waters continues to build on its robust base with customer relationships. And importantly, it's highly technical team of scientists and engineers with deep understanding of our customers problems to solve. For example, Arc HPLC which was launched in 2020, allows customers to increase the performance and capabilities for their high volume workhorse instruments without revalidating their existing methods. This is absolutely critical in compliant environments and helps us provide the benefits of newer technology to our customers while ensuring backwards compatibility. Meanwhile, our MaxPeak Premier technology provides important benefits and applications where sensitivity and reproducibility is key by virtually eliminating the metal binding affinity of compounds, like mRNAs, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans. On the instrument side, acuity Premier is a UPLC that was custom designed for biologics and novel modality applications, providing 100x better detection sensitivity than non-premier instruments and a 50% reduction in peak scaling. Within our chemistry portfolio MaxPeak premier columns which also offer this high performance, surface coatings have set a record in terms of uptake for new columns as this technology continues to be well received by our final customers. Turning to a mass spec portfolio, one additional example of innovation is our Select Series MRT, which is a high resolution multi reflecting time of flight instrument that provides remarkable accuracy at high speed with outstanding clarity. This instrument is setting the benchmark and mass accuracy. It's high throughput is enabling large sample studies of proteins and metabolites which previously would have taken too much time to conduct. Additionally, you may have seen our announcement this morning of what is this acquisition of charge detection mass spec technology CDMS. CDMS overcomes limitations of conventional mass spec in characterizing, analyzing and quantifying complex large molecules. This investments will allow Waters to develop and commercialize CDMS technology to solve significant unmet needs and novel modality settings such as cell and gene therapy for drug development. For the discipline my colleagues, Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett have brought into launches new products meaningfully grown in their contribution this year and with our product vitality index around 150 basis points up around 150 basis points to approximately 15% in Q4. Turning now to Slide 9. A key element of our informatics strategy is to provide customers with tools that help them better manage their workflows and achieve faster, easier results with high quality compliant data. Last month, we extended our next generation informatics platform Waters Connect to our Tandem Quad mass spectrometers for core quantitation starting with food testing. As any scientist who works in mass spec will tell you current software across the industry is powerful, but designed to fit all purposes and as a result can be complicated and difficult to use. A new software is built around the purpose and end market application for which it is being used. Delivering on our key principle of providing advanced technology that is fast, robust and easy to use. It reduces review times by up to 50% compared to the current market leading platform by allowing labs to meet their compliance and data integrity requirements. The overriding benefit here is that analysts can reduce review time to a minimum which is one of the largest bottlenecks in the lab, improving workflows for quantitative LCMS and mass spec data review is critical for our customers as it helps improve the throughput and efficacy. I spent time with our launch team last week and the rollout has begun with food testing applications and the plan to extend it to other applications in the near future. Now turning to Slide 10. Let me turn to the critical problems in higher growth adjacencies that we identified this year and believe we can solve overtime. First, in Bioseparations, we see an opportunity to take our chemistry expertise from small molecule separations and apply it to novel modalities and large molecule separation. Despite the rapid growth, there are significant challenges in characterizing and confirming the quality of these large complex molecules. Take mRNA as an example. The industry has a key unmet need of sustaining analytical control when measuring molecular integrity. Current practices for newer modalities like this are not as reproducible as desired, because there is not enough precision. So by advancing a biologic capabilities, we can unleash our chemistry expertise and our engineering expertise to better characterize and separate these molecules and then identify items such as process related impurities and degradation that are critical in later stage development and high volume manufacturing. In this area specifically, we're looking at bioseparations solutions for mRNA and other nucleic acids, proteins and lipid nanoparticles, as well as viral vector gene therapies and vaccines, and adeno associated viruses. Second, in bioprocess characterization, one of the key differences in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing is that once you define the manufacturing process, you're effectively stuck with it and cannot optimize it without completely revalidating the process because it is tied to the drug master file. By providing analytical techniques that are powerful enough to characterize the product sufficiently, we believe that we can overcome this barrier and separate the process from the product. This is a significant need in the industry and has the potential to be a very attractive market. Our partnership with Sartorius is a key step in this journey and as we bring the processing power of LCMS [outlines] [ph] the biocode in a workflow that is simple, powerful and fast and can be easily used on site by bioprocess engineers. The third application is of LCMS and diagnostics, where we need a fast, unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe mass spec has a significant role to play here. They've already demonstrated a proof of concept that the U.K. government in characterizing the past CoV2 virus with excellent sensitivity and selectivity, leading to a lower false positive rate than many other techniques. In review, our strong fourth quarter results cap a very successful year for Waters with broad based across our end markets and geographies. We sustained our momentum with strong two years stack revenue growth throughout the year, without transformation now embedded in how we operate. Our core business has been revitalized with growing contributions from innovative new products and initiatives. We are laser focused on our commercial execution. The market we serve remain in a healthy state and our regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows. Meanwhile, we see opportunities in higher growth adjacencies that will raise our exposure to faster growing market segments as we start to solve the critical problems we've identified over time. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and full year financials as well as our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2022. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of 836 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency and an increase of 6% as reported. We had a record instrument sales this quarter, which increased 12% versus prior year and 8% on a two year stack basis. Despite six fewer calendar days, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 3% for the quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 5% and service revenues were up 2%, both of which had tough comparisons in the prior year. The six fewer calendar days in the quarter, translated to a growth headwind of approximately 6% for recurring revenue and approximately 3% for total revenue. For the full year, sales grew by about 16% in constant currency and 18% as reported, recurring revenues grew 11% with chemistry up 15% and service up 9%, while instrument sales grew 23%, driven by strong customer demand and new product introductions. Our two-year stacked constant currency sales growth was 7.5% for Q4 and 7% for the second half of 2021 versus 6.5% for the first half. This acceleration underscores our good commercial momentum heading into 2022. Looking ahead, comparing 2022 to 2021, there is one fewer day in the first quarter, no change in the second or third quarters and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 58%. On a full year basis, gross margin was 58.5% compared to 57.4% in the prior year with improvements driven primarily by volume leverage and a 30 basis points tailwind from FX. Moving down the P&L for Q4 operating expenses increased by approximately 12% on a constant currency basis and include an increase of approximately 7% due to the normalization of our prior year COVID-related cost actions. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18% higher in constant currency and include an increase of 15% due to the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions. In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.4% and 13.8%, respectively. For the full year, our effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points due to a favorable change in our income mix by jurisdiction. Our average share count came in at 61.4 million shares, which is about 1.1 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.67 in comparison to $3.65 last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost reductions, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.52 compared to $3.49 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was up 24% at $11.20 versus $9.05 in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.17 versus $8.36 a year ago, the increase was driven primarily by sales volume, partially offset by the normalization of our COVID-related cost action. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow capital deployment on our balance sheet, we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow was 187 million after funding 45 million of capital expenditures, excluded from the free cash flow was 9 million related to the investments in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and 5 million in costs relating to one-time litigation settlement. For the full year, free cash flow was 675 million, with approximately $0.24 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable DSOs came in at 66 days, down four days compared to the fourth quarter of last year and down five days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by nine days, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Given higher sales volumes and our proactive measures to secure supply, inventory increased by 52 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 448,000 shares of our common stock for 156 million in Q4. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was 945 million with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about one. Our capital deployment priorities are investing for growth, maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility and returning capital to shareholders along with focus on deploying capital to well thought out attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 11. In 2021, our momentum has progressively accelerated, driven by a robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we head into 2022, we expect our momentum to continue and that we will be able to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and believe that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. These dynamics support full year 2022 guidance of 5% to 7% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately one percentage point, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30% to 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately 35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 61 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022 and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share have now projected in the range of $11.75 to $12. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately two percentage points at today's rates. Looking at the first quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately three percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately four percentage points at today's rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this year. Our core business is reenergized, our transformation is on track. And we built really good commercial momentum going into 2022. And we are laser focused on our commercial execution and accelerating innovation through our portfolio while reaching higher growth, close adjacent markets. With a new leadership team in place and our transformation well underway, we're also expanding our focus on environmental, social and governance topics. We've initiated a complete materiality assessment which will allow us to look at areas where Waters can contribute and ensuring we do our part to leave the world better than we found it. I look forward to sharing an update on this later this year. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. At this time, we'll begin our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I had one on the Q and one on guidance. And maybe we'll start with the Q, Udit\u201d. If I look at the instrument growth of 5%, 12% that came in well above expectations. Was there any year-end budget flush? Or is this the continuation of the execution momentum we've seen throughout the course of \u201921? Maybe talk about what happened in Q4, why instruments came in so strong?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Vijay, thank you for the question and good morning. Look, we've seen strong instrument growth momentum throughout the year and Q4 is no exception. And this is largely attributed to our commercial. Our commercial initiatives, especially the replacement initiative and the successful launch of new products, especially the Arc HPLC, the Acuity Premier, and more recently, the high res mass spec platform. The full year numbers from an instrument perspective, I would say even more interesting. I think their instruments have really led the growth with mid 20s sort of growth rate with LC coming around that range, mass spec a little bit slower and TA really endearing in the high 20s in growth rate. So instruments have really led the charge in terms of our recovery and that bodes, as you know, very well for the future for our service and recurring businesses. So to summarize, really, it's commercial momentum, new products that we've seen throughout the year and nothing sort of dramatic that was taking place at the end of the year. That was very different from what we have seen throughout the year.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Udit. And maybe one for Amol on the guidance. It looks like Q4 gross margin came in a little bit light. And I thought I heard you say it was in line with expectations. Is there anything on the gross margin line for fiscal '22? Because I look at your revenue growth -- reported revenue growth of the four to six, earnings growth of a five to seven, you do have some share repurchases going on. So that implies maybe perhaps margins were flat to down, what would cause margins to be down and is that a gross margin issue?\nAmol Chaubal: Good morning, Vijay, and thanks for the question. So look, I mean, the gross margin for Q4 came in as we had guided. And if you compare it versus prior year, the gross margin is lower because of three factors. There is a 50 basis points headwind from exchange rate. But then there were also prior year COVID cost actions that normalize this year. And then, the quarter was heavier on instruments and instruments are lower margin compared to other elements of our portfolio. So when you put those three things together, it sort of reconciles with the gross margin last year. Where we are guiding for 22 at approximately 58% is in line with what we did this year. And on the operating margin side, we are saying about 30% to 30.5%. So it's sort of slightly better than 30.2% on the top end of the range. What is in there is also the tax rate, we are saying tax rate, we are expecting 15.5%. That's higher than the tax rate we had this year, primarily because the 2017 regs have a provision in place, which requires capitalization of R&D expenses, and our x-U.S. R&D expenses when capitalized will have an impact on the guilty provisions. So that has added about a little over a percentage point to the tax rate. That's included in our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you so much for your question. Our next question is from Dan Brennan with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for the question, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just to start on -- just on the overall biopharma market. Just could you give us a sense, Udit, in terms of what the addressable market is growing at today? How Water is doing from a share perspective, particularly across your LCMS mass spec portfolios?\nUdit Batra: Sure. Good morning, Dan. Look, overall, the best way to look at this is to look at stacked growth rates, right? If you just look at the stacked growth rates, we finished the year around 7% overall in the business where pharma came in higher at double-digit. And what we've seen on the pharma side is really strong uptake, not just the demand, not just the increasing demand in the market. So it's slightly higher than historical averages, but also water specific execution. First, from a commercial perspective, across our five commercial initiatives, as well as new product introduction which has had very good uptake, especially in pharma, arc HPLC has done very well, especially in China. And increasingly in the U.S. and Europe, the acuity premier with the MaxPeak technology has really hit a real sweet spot with novel modalities, which have higher affinity to metal surfaces. So new products, especially on the instrument side. And now we have introduced our next generation of informatics platform for mass spec. So we expect new products to continue to do well. So to summarize, the pharma end market has been a bit more robust than historical averages. But in that robust market, we have been executing extremely well from a commercial perspective, as well as with new product introductions. So that bodes well for what we think about in the future for this largest end market.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you for that. And then maybe if I can ask a two-parter, just one on China, obviously, Q4 was a really nice stack acceleration. You had some color in the prepared remarks. Just wondering what to assume for '22 in China? And then on an unrelated base, just bioproduction, you did the deal today, which is likely a very small tuck-in, you have the Sartorius deal, but how do we think about your organic and inorganic investments going forward over the next year in bioproduction? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Dan, I mean, China, thanks for the question, really excited. I mean, it all starts with leadership. We have a new leader in China who's really executing what I've talked about at a global level from a commercial perspective. Overall, I mean, as the overall business grew 16% for the year, China was in the mid-20s, driven again, by very, very strong instrument growth rates, well in excess of 30% growth where LC is doing very well. From an end market perspective in China, pharma, and/or especially our focus on CDMOS there has grown the business in excess of 40%. So excited about what we're seeing in China. New products are doing extremely well. And there's no reason to believe that that should slow down going into the New Year. If anything, we expect newer products to gain even more traction. And there's a lot more to do in China, by the way, increasing penetration across the board. And then, turning to your question on bioproduction, look, in general, the two growth initiatives that we've highlighted, that are focused on biologics and novel modalities are number one on bioseparations, and number two on bioproduction. On bioseparations, we are a world leader in separating small molecules. And with our chemistry and engineering expertise, we're simply turning that to larger molecules, like mRNA oligonucleotides proteins. And then from a bioproduction perspective, we've talked about first, the collaboration, we have Sartorius, where we first focused on characterizing the process for a high volume application called clone selection, where we took the workflow from about six weeks to less than a week. And that has a lot of traction with our customers, we are now adding on other attributes that we want to measure for the process, creating a seamless software bridge between the [indiscernible] of Sartorius as well as the biocode that we have. And then looking at other applications, be it scale up to larger bio reactors, or other modalities like again, oligonucleotides and more complex protein. So a lot of runway on the bioproduction side, and the deal that we announced a small tuck-in as you know, CDMS, thanks for asking about it. It's something that's good and dear to my heart. And I must admit, I started off as a skeptic. When I first heard about the technology, the team sent me some publications and said, hey, it's a technology. And I thought it's another hobby, but it's a really good fit, right. So basically, the CDMS technology takes mass spec to larger molecules, where we can now separate mRNA as well as viral vectors, which are larger proteins, intact proteins where mass spec reaches its limits. And what excited us the most is a demonstration we did with our customers several months ago, where we expected roughly 20 customers to come in Kendall Square, where we have our immerse lab roughly 40 showed up, I was so excited, I asked them all and our Head of Strategy. Dan Welch to join me to listen to the customers that sealed the deal, right? So we basically said, look, this is a technology that our customers really, really want. It's going to allow them to analyze more complex molecules much more carefully. And now we have the development, commercialization manufacturing rights for the technology. So super excited about what we are seeing in the bioproduction, bioseparations area.\nOperator: Our next question is from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.\nPuneet Souda: So first of all, congrats on the strong quarter here. Really strong in instrumentation growth. So have a bit of a question on the guide. First, 5% to 7% full year guide, how much are you expecting in terms of contribution from the replacement initiative here? I mean, is this still a 40 million or so replacement initiative for 2022 as you were expecting before or is it more now? And how much contribution in the full year guide from maybe new growth initiative with the separations and bioprocessing clone selection the diagnostics? Yes, contribution overall from -- in the guide from the replacement initiatives and these new initiatives that you have in place now because I mean, Udit you joined them in 2020. It's been one full year of lift that we're seeing in the replacement cycle, and just wanting to get as to sort of how should we think about this year and maybe even into next year for the replacement initiatives in these new efforts that you have underway?\nUdit Batra: Puneet, the way I would think about the contribution across the five initiatives instrumental placement, service attach ecommerce, CDMO is about 100 basis points of acceleration beyond what we see in the market. So that's how I would look at that piece, sort of lump it all together and it's about 100 basis points give or take. Second, on the new growth initiatives, as I commented in the previous quarter, as well as at a recent conference. This is something that we expect to meaningfully contribute in the mid to long term. We are very excited about the traction we have on bioprocessing with our collaboration with Sartorius. We're doing very well on the early stages of adapting SCMS for specialty applications in diagnostics. And we have a very good start on bioseparations as well as some other initiatives. So you should expect that to contribute in the midterm. In the short-term, about 100 basis points from our initiatives that are already ongoing. And in the midterm, these other initiatives will start to contribute meaningfully. It\u2019s a great start. But I would say the midterm starting '23, '24 is when you should start seeing an impact of these initiatives.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then on the order book and overall demand. Just maybe could you update us where the backlog stands? I think that's fairly strong in the fourth quarter, even in third quarter, maybe just give us, how do you see that conversion in the first quarter and through the year? And just update us if you could on the supply chain, obviously, that's impacting number of companies. But how should we bounce that order conversion versus the supply chain and any other inflation concerns that you're seeing in the market? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Puneet, you asked two maybe three questions in one, I'll try to take them each in turn. First, in terms of the order book, it's extremely strong. We don't get specific numbers on the backlog. But it's higher than it's been in the past, you can safely assume that orders are growing faster than sales. Now in terms of challenges that we're facing on supply chain on pricing, let's take a step back. We're not immune to those challenges like anybody else. Especially on the material side, where there are material constraints, what I would say on that front, having now extreme transparency into the primary, secondary, tertiary suppliers, deep sort of discussions with those colleagues in different companies. And the fact that we have a nimble organization here our size and our simple portfolio is a huge advantage. We're able to communicate any sort of changes rapidly through the organization through supply chain into commercial and be able to deal with it. And we've dealt successfully with any sort of disruption in Q3 and Q4. I'm not saying it was easy, but we've dealt with it, given the transparency and given the communication we have internally and externally with stakeholders. And by contrast, I think Q1 is like summer vacation versus Q4. So I'm not diminishing the topic, it's still with us. But we have developed that muscle. And in terms of pricing and freight. Look, we've had about 100 basis points or so of pricing in 2021, you should expect, say 150 basis points give or take. But what I would like to emphasize here, this is not a willy-nilly transfer of pricing to our customers. We have, as I said many times very, very strong relationship with our customers, we have open discussions and wherever we see challenges, we discuss them. And there's a lot of understanding as we pass on some of the increases in pricing that we see. So I think I've addressed several of your questions. And Amol, do you to \u2013\nAmol Chaubal: I mean just to build on it, Puneet, as you know, I mean, our products are differentiated. And that's not just instruments. I mean, we have very innovative chemistry portfolio that the customers like. We have a great track record and a seamless service. And we have an informatics platform that's really valued by our customers. So that puts us in a great spot to have these discussions to with our customers walk them through what's happening in the market. And then internally, what we've done is, we're keeping a close eye on how prices are moving in the market, especially labor freight and electronic components. We are constantly training and educating our sales teams so that they are aware about what's happening on the operation side so that they can have productive dialogue with our customers. And through Q4. we've navigated that well and that gives us a lot of confidence going into 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: So strong end to the year on the chemistry front, was hoping you could comment more on customer ordering trends. Do you think there was any stocking benefit in the quarter or any quantifiable budget flush across the portfolio?\nUdit Batra: Not really didn't see, I would say what we saw, of course, there's always a run up at the end of the year in this business. But I would say it's nothing unusual. And the way -- the reason I say that we're seeing similar trends persist into the year as well. So we're seeing really a continuation of what we saw towards the year end. And the orders, as we commented earlier, orders are outpacing the sales. So that gives us confidence that this is not sort of a big pull forward of any sort of products. And when you look at Waters are specific reasons, right, so we can, and again, I'll draw your attention to the overall stacked growth numbers. We've basically ended the year with the second half being stronger than the first half of the year, overall for the year, it's roughly 7% stacked growth. Where instruments are roughly 6% growth, which is well above our historical averages. And, again, the same thing for consumables which are close to double-digit growth. This is, again, above historical averages, but there are Waters specific reasons driving both of those. So in both cases, we have commercial initiatives that have driven that and new products that have contributed. So nothing really that one should look at as a blip. I mean, this is something that we expect to continue both the commercial as well as the new product momentum.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then just was hoping either you or Amol could comment on expectations for operating expenses in 2022. So gross margins of 58%, it'd be down something like 50 bps year-over-year, the op margin is more like flat. So just talk about the investments in R&D, and sales and marketing for 2022. What's the plan there?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes, thanks. That's a great question. So as we get into 2022, our focus is to drive productivity gains through various different initiatives that are in place across service productivity, operational excellence in manufacturing, both direct and indirect procurement programs, as well as things like digitization and building capability center in India. And those will provide a great amount of space for us to fund the high growth adjacencies that we've talked about. And so net of that we think, as we've said at JPMorgan conference, allows us to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. And that's what is embedded in our guide. So we've guided at 30% to 30.5% versus 30.2% for 2021. So at the higher end of the guide, you do get the 20 to 30 basis points that we had \u2013\nUdit Batra: I think just to sort of conclude the formula is very simple. I mean, we drive the top line with our initiatives, there's a lot of leverage in the P&L. And with the productivity initiatives, we make a bit more room. We're not skimping on the investments. We believe that these are really necessary and helpful for us to set up the future. And hence we deliver a 20 to 30 basis points increase in margin. So the idea is very simple.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, Amol, I wonder if you could comment on how you're thinking about growth across instruments, consumables and service for 2022 or within your 2022 guide.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Look, I mean, as we've traditionally seen, you would see service growth at the midpoint of the guide. Instrument growth is slightly lower than that and chemistry growth is slightly about that about two percentage points spread plus or minus.\nUdit Batra: And Josh, not much different than what you would have seen in and how we exited 2021. So 7% stack rose with consumables being closer to double-digit, instrument being slightly lower at 6%, but well above historical averages.\nOperator: Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nMike Ryskin: This is Mike Ryskin on for Derek. I'm going to ask two quick ones. First on the academic and government markets. didn't really touch on the prepared remarks. You guys had a little bit of a bounce back to end the year. But I know that can be super volatile and 2020 was an easy comp. So could you give us an update on what you're seeing in that probably more than the mass spec portfolio. But still is that end market across geographies, starting to come back to normal, or is there still some choppiness there? And then, the quick follow is on M&A, the Megadalton deal. Most technology tuck-in, is that, something like that technology or an underlying platform deal, something we should expect going forward. Just given your leverage in the balance sheet, are you willing to look at bigger assets? Thanks.\nUdit Batra: Thanks, Mike. On academic and government look, we're pleased with how we ended the year with a 5% growth. But it's still very choppy across the geographies and across the portfolio. We saw nice recovery in Europe, very much driven by our mass spec portfolio like so and there the businesses rather lumpy. So that said, what I'd rather focus on in that end market is what we're trying to do to establish a basis is reviving our KOL relationships. And recently I was with a KOL, who's been with Waters for a very long time, Head of our Proteomics Institute at one of the top medical schools in the U.S. And he basically said in no uncertain terms that have careers been sort of built together with Waters, especially on the mass spec side. So we are very optimistic on what we will be able to do in that market. But it's early days, right on the academic and government market. And then on M&A, on the Megadalton deal, this is a very good fit. So for large novel modalities to characterize them better with mass spec, and we know mass spec really, really well. You should expect us to continue to look for such technology accelerators. But also, we're open to building our portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, both on the floor as well as the faster growth adjacencies wherever we find something relevant. But I will remind you that look, our core business is performing extremely well. And that is the number one focus to continue the commercial momentum, to continue delivering new products across our base portfolio. And as you noticed, across the LC portfolio, across the mass spec portfolio now informatics, we're seeing a drumbeat of new products that are adding on to the field. So the focus is on the core. And we are very open to looking at M&A that accelerates and sentence our position. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: I just wanted to add on the previous question, so on the academics and government, China is one area of focus for us because if you look at China, we grew on a stack basis in [indiscernible] constant currency, industrial stack 16%. But what brought it down was academics and government. And we are laser focused on revitalizing growth in that business. There are two parts to the problem, part of it is our own commercial execution, which we are focused on. But there's also drag from the VAT reimbursement issue, which we think will progressively resolve over the course of 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Udit, maybe just a follow up on Mike's question there in terms of M&A. You've mentioned the large [mall] [ph] strategy a few times, obviously, one, where you see investment [indiscernible]? I mean, how do you think about balancing organic versus inorganic investments in that segment? I mean, is the base business, do you feel like the technology isn't a good enough place to kind of go after some of those high growth areas? Or do you feel like it really needs to be supplemented in organically with some deals just curious on the strategy on that front?\nUdit Batra: Patrick, I mean, it's a great question. I mean, we don't have a dogma there. But it always starts with what we know how to do. So we know how to do analytical measurements. And we've turned that focus towards larger molecules and more complex molecules both in the bioseparations arena, where there are significant challenges. Even if you take mRNA as an example, in aggregation and separation of these molecules. Lipid nanoparticles or plasmids, and there, we are perfectly capable of making a difference with our internal focus and collaborations with reagents companies and people who know how to do sample prep for biologics. So I think that for me, is the perfect combination. And on the bioprocessing side, we started with a partnership where we wanted our organization to learn the whole bioprocessing domain. And now we -- as we get a better understanding, we will surely be looking at augmenting our capabilities in Indiana on the analytical front. So you will not see us going and buying a bioreactor or a filtration company but you will see us looking at better analytical techniques to elucidate the structure and properties of these complex molecules, but it's a mix. So it's a heavy focus on organic investments, where relevant partnerships and where we see opportunities that beat up the separations of these molecules or as was characterized bioprocessing better, we will be active in the M&A space.\nOperator: That does conclude our Q&A portion of today's conference. I will now turn our call back over to Mr. Udit Batra.\nUdit Batra: Thank you. Thank you all for your participation and your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our first quarter 2022 call which is currently anticipated on May 3, 2022. Thank you and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: This does concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect and have a great rest of your day.",

            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We've ended a very successful year at Waters. In end markets with sustainable growth drivers, we have revived our resilient business and are now focused on growing our portfolio. Despite higher comparables, we saw strong growth continue with an acceleration on a stacked basis as the year went on. The strength we've seen in our instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for the future, as our new products have gained traction and this all supports the sustainable future growth we expect to see in our consumables and service. Before summarizing the quarter and full year, let me start by thanking my colleagues around the globe who represented the indomitable spirit of Waters throughout 2021, remain focused on supporting our customers and delivering exciting new products despite the challenging conditions of the pandemic. Achieving these results in a normal year would have been quite an accomplishment but to do so while balancing the continued ups and downs of the pandemic with a major transformation and a new leadership team is indeed quite remarkable. Now I'm turning to Slide 3, we have three messages. We have a resilient and attractive portfolio of instruments systems, chemistry, consumables and services in end markets that are supported by sustainable growth drivers. We revitalize the score by engaging our customers progressing on a number of growth initiatives and continuing to innovate across our portfolio while launching exciting new products. And now we're focused on growth of our core business as well as accessing high-volume applications and faster-growing adjacencies. I will now provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year operating results as well as commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone line to take your questions. Moving on to Slide 4. In the fourth quarter, our revenue grew 6% as reported and 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad strength across our end markets and geographies with double-digit year-end demand for our instruments and continued growth in our recurring revenue products. This translates to a 7.5% two-year stacked CAGR for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant currency basis. For the full year, revenue grew 18% as reported and 16% in constant currency as we saw strong growth in 2021 across all our regions led by pharma and industrial end markets. This translates to a 7% two years stacked CAGR for the year versus 2019 in constant currency. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.67 per share, up 1% year-on-year and 7% stacked. Excluding the effect of our prior year COVID cost actions and FX, EPS grew 8% versus last year. For the full year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 24% to $11.20 and 12% on a two-year stacked basis. Now looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5. In constant currency first, by operating segment, the Waters division grew 7%, while TA grew 16%. The end market, our largest market category, pharma grew 8%, industrial grew 7% and academic and government grew at 5%. In pharma, we saw continued broad-based strength in sales across segments, geographies and applications. Biopharma and contract organizations grew well above 20%. In industrial, growth was led by our TA business, which saw strong global strength in thermal as well as microcalorimetry and rheology. Within the Waters division, we saw broad demand for LC instruments across our geographies as well as our customers, as well as our customer segments who continue to invest in new capital equipment. Turning to academic and government, we saw an improvement with growth across most of our geographies into the year-end. We're actively revitalizing our relationships with KOLs, which is an integral part of achieving long-term success in academic and government. While it takes some time for us to regain traction, Waters has familiarity and a fan base amongst KOLs, who have often used instruments throughout their careers. Just last week, I was talking with the head of a leading core lab at one of our \u2013 one of the top medical institutions in the United States. He has worked closely with Waters for the better part of two decades to build up proteomics capabilities at this institution and currently has over 40 Waters LCs and 20 mass spec instruments from our company. Moving now, to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 9% with China up 13%, Americas 8%, with U.S. up 8% and Europe grew 5%. In China, we saw strong demand throughout the quarter with growth led by contractors, biopharma and a strong recovery in clinical. We also saw strong growth in food testing and chemical assays. In the U.S. growth came from ongoing strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. In pharma, sales was strong in LC and mass spec, which combined grew in the mid-teens with chemistry up low double digits. In industrial, our TA business saw strong instrument placement across applications, led by advanced materials, chemicals and battery testing. In Europe, all end markets continued to grow led by pharma and industrial with food and environmental businesses, resulting in strong demand for our Tandem Quads. Meanwhile, pharma sales remained solid with growth led by large molecule applications. By product and services, customer demand for our instruments finished the year strong, continuing the trend of instrument growth that we saw throughout the year, while demand for recurring revenue products remained strong. Overall instrument sales grew 12% for the quarter with a robust demand driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. In LC, Arc HPLC continued to see strong global growth in our core segments as demand continues to ramp. Meanwhile, our acuity and arc premier instruments continued to see strong adoption, driven by applications in large molecule and novel modality such as mRNA. In mass spec, we saw growth in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, led by Xevo TQ-XS, Xevo TQ-XS micro. We also saw strong demand from our biopharma and CRO customers as well as for food safety applications. In our high risk mass spec portfolio, we saw the demand for cyclic with drug discovery applications. We're also encouraged by the early adoption of our new, SELECT SERIES MRT, Time-of-Fight platform, the customers using it for biopharma discovery and OMEX applications. For recurring revenues, despite the quarter having six fewer days in the fourth quarter of 2020, chemistry sales grew 5%, led by continued high utilization biopharma customers. Our new MaxPeak, Premier Columns continued to provide incremental growth for our chemistry business. This technology provides important benefits in separation and purification of mRNA, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans, which is effectively answering the needs of our customers as they work with more complex molecules. Service grew to 2% despite a tough double-digit comparison a year ago with strong growth in both China and in India, which has been a theme throughout the year. Finally, TA had another great quarter, with sales up 16% led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong in all regions, the growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals including batteries and electronics. Looking now, at our top line results for the full year on Slide 6, in constant currency, the Waters division grew 15%, while TA grew 25%. By end market, pharma grew 19% and industrial grew 15%, while academic and government came at 5% for the year. Pharma which is our largest market has grown 10% on a two-year stack basis driven by strong demand in our instruments and recurring revenues with strength in both large and small molecule applications. We've also seen ongoing strength in our industrial and applied market, which has grown 6% on a two-year stack basis led by China as well as North America and Europe. In academic and government, which has been our slowest market to recover sales in Europe and the U.S. are close to pre-pandemic levels as China has further in its recovery as university spending continues to be constrained. By geography, Asia grew 19%, China growing 25%, Americas grew at 16% with the U.S. growing at 14% and Europe also grew 14%. For the full year on a two-year stack basis, our three largest geographies, the U.S. China and Europe was 6%, 7% and 8% respectively. What is especially pleasing is that the demand is balanced across all geographies including a robust recovery in the U.S. By products and services, instruments grew 23% for the year, chemistry 15% and service grew 9%. On a stack basis instruments grew 6%, chemistry 9% and service 6%, showing strong performance above our historical averages. The strength we've seen in our LC instrument portfolio throughout the year remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables as well as service. Our growth in recurring revenues has also been supported by the progress we've made in ecommerce as well as delivering higher attachment rates in service. Given the global nature of our business, we're certainly not immune to the ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. But we are proactively addressing these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers. Now moving on to Slide #7. We covered this in our Q3 earnings call and also at the recent JPMorgan conference. Our initiatives across instrument replacement, service attachment, contract organizations, ecommerce and new product launch excellence have all been important components for us to gaining our momentum and delivering strong performance in 2021. We've continued to exceed expectations and milestones on these initiatives and believe that each has further one way not just in 2022 but in years beyond providing an average incremental growth impact of roughly 100 basis points annually across the base business in the next two to three years, as our transformation program is firmly on track. Moving now on to Slide 8. The strength of our business is being supported by instrument innovation with recent product launches that have revitalized our core. Waters continues to build on its robust base with customer relationships. And importantly, it's highly technical team of scientists and engineers with deep understanding of our customers problems to solve. For example, Arc HPLC which was launched in 2020, allows customers to increase the performance and capabilities for their high volume workhorse instruments without revalidating their existing methods. This is absolutely critical in compliant environments and helps us provide the benefits of newer technology to our customers while ensuring backwards compatibility. Meanwhile, our MaxPeak Premier technology provides important benefits and applications where sensitivity and reproducibility is key by virtually eliminating the metal binding affinity of compounds, like mRNAs, oligonucleotides, peptides and glycans. On the instrument side, acuity Premier is a UPLC that was custom designed for biologics and novel modality applications, providing 100x better detection sensitivity than non-premier instruments and a 50% reduction in peak scaling. Within our chemistry portfolio MaxPeak premier columns which also offer this high performance, surface coatings have set a record in terms of uptake for new columns as this technology continues to be well received by our final customers. Turning to a mass spec portfolio, one additional example of innovation is our Select Series MRT, which is a high resolution multi reflecting time of flight instrument that provides remarkable accuracy at high speed with outstanding clarity. This instrument is setting the benchmark and mass accuracy. It's high throughput is enabling large sample studies of proteins and metabolites which previously would have taken too much time to conduct. Additionally, you may have seen our announcement this morning of what is this acquisition of charge detection mass spec technology CDMS. CDMS overcomes limitations of conventional mass spec in characterizing, analyzing and quantifying complex large molecules. This investments will allow Waters to develop and commercialize CDMS technology to solve significant unmet needs and novel modality settings such as cell and gene therapy for drug development. For the discipline my colleagues, Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett have brought into launches new products meaningfully grown in their contribution this year and with our product vitality index around 150 basis points up around 150 basis points to approximately 15% in Q4. Turning now to Slide 9. A key element of our informatics strategy is to provide customers with tools that help them better manage their workflows and achieve faster, easier results with high quality compliant data. Last month, we extended our next generation informatics platform Waters Connect to our Tandem Quad mass spectrometers for core quantitation starting with food testing. As any scientist who works in mass spec will tell you current software across the industry is powerful, but designed to fit all purposes and as a result can be complicated and difficult to use. A new software is built around the purpose and end market application for which it is being used. Delivering on our key principle of providing advanced technology that is fast, robust and easy to use. It reduces review times by up to 50% compared to the current market leading platform by allowing labs to meet their compliance and data integrity requirements. The overriding benefit here is that analysts can reduce review time to a minimum which is one of the largest bottlenecks in the lab, improving workflows for quantitative LCMS and mass spec data review is critical for our customers as it helps improve the throughput and efficacy. I spent time with our launch team last week and the rollout has begun with food testing applications and the plan to extend it to other applications in the near future. Now turning to Slide 10. Let me turn to the critical problems in higher growth adjacencies that we identified this year and believe we can solve overtime. First, in Bioseparations, we see an opportunity to take our chemistry expertise from small molecule separations and apply it to novel modalities and large molecule separation. Despite the rapid growth, there are significant challenges in characterizing and confirming the quality of these large complex molecules. Take mRNA as an example. The industry has a key unmet need of sustaining analytical control when measuring molecular integrity. Current practices for newer modalities like this are not as reproducible as desired, because there is not enough precision. So by advancing a biologic capabilities, we can unleash our chemistry expertise and our engineering expertise to better characterize and separate these molecules and then identify items such as process related impurities and degradation that are critical in later stage development and high volume manufacturing. In this area specifically, we're looking at bioseparations solutions for mRNA and other nucleic acids, proteins and lipid nanoparticles, as well as viral vector gene therapies and vaccines, and adeno associated viruses. Second, in bioprocess characterization, one of the key differences in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing is that once you define the manufacturing process, you're effectively stuck with it and cannot optimize it without completely revalidating the process because it is tied to the drug master file. By providing analytical techniques that are powerful enough to characterize the product sufficiently, we believe that we can overcome this barrier and separate the process from the product. This is a significant need in the industry and has the potential to be a very attractive market. Our partnership with Sartorius is a key step in this journey and as we bring the processing power of LCMS [outlines] [ph] the biocode in a workflow that is simple, powerful and fast and can be easily used on site by bioprocess engineers. The third application is of LCMS and diagnostics, where we need a fast, unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe mass spec has a significant role to play here. They've already demonstrated a proof of concept that the U.K. government in characterizing the past CoV2 virus with excellent sensitivity and selectivity, leading to a lower false positive rate than many other techniques. In review, our strong fourth quarter results cap a very successful year for Waters with broad based across our end markets and geographies. We sustained our momentum with strong two years stack revenue growth throughout the year, without transformation now embedded in how we operate. Our core business has been revitalized with growing contributions from innovative new products and initiatives. We are laser focused on our commercial execution. The market we serve remain in a healthy state and our regions have rebounded solidly from pandemic lows. Meanwhile, we see opportunities in higher growth adjacencies that will raise our exposure to faster growing market segments as we start to solve the critical problems we've identified over time. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the fourth quarter and full year financials as well as our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2022. Amol? Thank you, Amol. In summary, we are pleased with our performance this year. Our core business is reenergized, our transformation is on track. And we built really good commercial momentum going into 2022. And we are laser focused on our commercial execution and accelerating innovation through our portfolio while reaching higher growth, close adjacent markets. With a new leadership team in place and our transformation well underway, we're also expanding our focus on environmental, social and governance topics. We've initiated a complete materiality assessment which will allow us to look at areas where Waters can contribute and ensuring we do our part to leave the world better than we found it. I look forward to sharing an update on this later this year. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? Yes. So Vijay, thank you for the question and good morning. Look, we've seen strong instrument growth momentum throughout the year and Q4 is no exception. And this is largely attributed to our commercial. Our commercial initiatives, especially the replacement initiative and the successful launch of new products, especially the Arc HPLC, the Acuity Premier, and more recently, the high res mass spec platform. The full year numbers from an instrument perspective, I would say even more interesting. I think their instruments have really led the growth with mid 20s sort of growth rate with LC coming around that range, mass spec a little bit slower and TA really endearing in the high 20s in growth rate. So instruments have really led the charge in terms of our recovery and that bodes, as you know, very well for the future for our service and recurring businesses. So to summarize, really, it's commercial momentum, new products that we've seen throughout the year and nothing sort of dramatic that was taking place at the end of the year. That was very different from what we have seen throughout the year. Sure. Good morning, Dan. Look, overall, the best way to look at this is to look at stacked growth rates, right? If you just look at the stacked growth rates, we finished the year around 7% overall in the business where pharma came in higher at double-digit. And what we've seen on the pharma side is really strong uptake, not just the demand, not just the increasing demand in the market. So it's slightly higher than historical averages, but also water specific execution. First, from a commercial perspective, across our five commercial initiatives, as well as new product introduction which has had very good uptake, especially in pharma, arc HPLC has done very well, especially in China. And increasingly in the U.S. and Europe, the acuity premier with the MaxPeak technology has really hit a real sweet spot with novel modalities, which have higher affinity to metal surfaces. So new products, especially on the instrument side. And now we have introduced our next generation of informatics platform for mass spec. So we expect new products to continue to do well. So to summarize, the pharma end market has been a bit more robust than historical averages. But in that robust market, we have been executing extremely well from a commercial perspective, as well as with new product introductions. So that bodes well for what we think about in the future for this largest end market. Dan, I mean, China, thanks for the question, really excited. I mean, it all starts with leadership. We have a new leader in China who's really executing what I've talked about at a global level from a commercial perspective. Overall, I mean, as the overall business grew 16% for the year, China was in the mid-20s, driven again, by very, very strong instrument growth rates, well in excess of 30% growth where LC is doing very well. From an end market perspective in China, pharma, and/or especially our focus on CDMOS there has grown the business in excess of 40%. So excited about what we're seeing in China. New products are doing extremely well. And there's no reason to believe that that should slow down going into the New Year. If anything, we expect newer products to gain even more traction. And there's a lot more to do in China, by the way, increasing penetration across the board. And then, turning to your question on bioproduction, look, in general, the two growth initiatives that we've highlighted, that are focused on biologics and novel modalities are number one on bioseparations, and number two on bioproduction. On bioseparations, we are a world leader in separating small molecules. And with our chemistry and engineering expertise, we're simply turning that to larger molecules, like mRNA oligonucleotides proteins. And then from a bioproduction perspective, we've talked about first, the collaboration, we have Sartorius, where we first focused on characterizing the process for a high volume application called clone selection, where we took the workflow from about six weeks to less than a week. And that has a lot of traction with our customers, we are now adding on other attributes that we want to measure for the process, creating a seamless software bridge between the [indiscernible] of Sartorius as well as the biocode that we have. And then looking at other applications, be it scale up to larger bio reactors, or other modalities like again, oligonucleotides and more complex protein. So a lot of runway on the bioproduction side, and the deal that we announced a small tuck-in as you know, CDMS, thanks for asking about it. It's something that's good and dear to my heart. And I must admit, I started off as a skeptic. When I first heard about the technology, the team sent me some publications and said, hey, it's a technology. And I thought it's another hobby, but it's a really good fit, right. So basically, the CDMS technology takes mass spec to larger molecules, where we can now separate mRNA as well as viral vectors, which are larger proteins, intact proteins where mass spec reaches its limits. And what excited us the most is a demonstration we did with our customers several months ago, where we expected roughly 20 customers to come in Kendall Square, where we have our immerse lab roughly 40 showed up, I was so excited, I asked them all and our Head of Strategy. Dan Welch to join me to listen to the customers that sealed the deal, right? So we basically said, look, this is a technology that our customers really, really want. It's going to allow them to analyze more complex molecules much more carefully. And now we have the development, commercialization manufacturing rights for the technology. So super excited about what we are seeing in the bioproduction, bioseparations area. Puneet, the way I would think about the contribution across the five initiatives instrumental placement, service attach ecommerce, CDMO is about 100 basis points of acceleration beyond what we see in the market. So that's how I would look at that piece, sort of lump it all together and it's about 100 basis points give or take. Second, on the new growth initiatives, as I commented in the previous quarter, as well as at a recent conference. This is something that we expect to meaningfully contribute in the mid to long term. We are very excited about the traction we have on bioprocessing with our collaboration with Sartorius. We're doing very well on the early stages of adapting SCMS for specialty applications in diagnostics. And we have a very good start on bioseparations as well as some other initiatives. So you should expect that to contribute in the midterm. In the short-term, about 100 basis points from our initiatives that are already ongoing. And in the midterm, these other initiatives will start to contribute meaningfully. It's a great start. But I would say the midterm starting '23, '24 is when you should start seeing an impact of these initiatives. Puneet, you asked two maybe three questions in one, I'll try to take them each in turn. First, in terms of the order book, it's extremely strong. We don't get specific numbers on the backlog. But it's higher than it's been in the past, you can safely assume that orders are growing faster than sales. Now in terms of challenges that we're facing on supply chain on pricing, let's take a step back. We're not immune to those challenges like anybody else. Especially on the material side, where there are material constraints, what I would say on that front, having now extreme transparency into the primary, secondary, tertiary suppliers, deep sort of discussions with those colleagues in different companies. And the fact that we have a nimble organization here our size and our simple portfolio is a huge advantage. We're able to communicate any sort of changes rapidly through the organization through supply chain into commercial and be able to deal with it. And we've dealt successfully with any sort of disruption in Q3 and Q4. I'm not saying it was easy, but we've dealt with it, given the transparency and given the communication we have internally and externally with stakeholders. And by contrast, I think Q1 is like summer vacation versus Q4. So I'm not diminishing the topic, it's still with us. But we have developed that muscle. And in terms of pricing and freight. Look, we've had about 100 basis points or so of pricing in 2021, you should expect, say 150 basis points give or take. But what I would like to emphasize here, this is not a willy-nilly transfer of pricing to our customers. We have, as I said many times very, very strong relationship with our customers, we have open discussions and wherever we see challenges, we discuss them. And there's a lot of understanding as we pass on some of the increases in pricing that we see. So I think I've addressed several of your questions. And Amol, do you to \u2013 Not really didn't see, I would say what we saw, of course, there's always a run up at the end of the year in this business. But I would say it's nothing unusual. And the way -- the reason I say that we're seeing similar trends persist into the year as well. So we're seeing really a continuation of what we saw towards the year end. And the orders, as we commented earlier, orders are outpacing the sales. So that gives us confidence that this is not sort of a big pull forward of any sort of products. And when you look at Waters are specific reasons, right, so we can, and again, I'll draw your attention to the overall stacked growth numbers. We've basically ended the year with the second half being stronger than the first half of the year, overall for the year, it's roughly 7% stacked growth. Where instruments are roughly 6% growth, which is well above our historical averages. And, again, the same thing for consumables which are close to double-digit growth. This is, again, above historical averages, but there are Waters specific reasons driving both of those. So in both cases, we have commercial initiatives that have driven that and new products that have contributed. So nothing really that one should look at as a blip. I mean, this is something that we expect to continue both the commercial as well as the new product momentum. I think just to sort of conclude the formula is very simple. I mean, we drive the top line with our initiatives, there's a lot of leverage in the P&L. And with the productivity initiatives, we make a bit more room. We're not skimping on the investments. We believe that these are really necessary and helpful for us to set up the future. And hence we deliver a 20 to 30 basis points increase in margin. So the idea is very simple. And Josh, not much different than what you would have seen in and how we exited 2021. So 7% stack rose with consumables being closer to double-digit, instrument being slightly lower at 6%, but well above historical averages. Thanks, Mike. On academic and government look, we're pleased with how we ended the year with a 5% growth. But it's still very choppy across the geographies and across the portfolio. We saw nice recovery in Europe, very much driven by our mass spec portfolio like so and there the businesses rather lumpy. So that said, what I'd rather focus on in that end market is what we're trying to do to establish a basis is reviving our KOL relationships. And recently I was with a KOL, who's been with Waters for a very long time, Head of our Proteomics Institute at one of the top medical schools in the U.S. And he basically said in no uncertain terms that have careers been sort of built together with Waters, especially on the mass spec side. So we are very optimistic on what we will be able to do in that market. But it's early days, right on the academic and government market. And then on M&A, on the Megadalton deal, this is a very good fit. So for large novel modalities to characterize them better with mass spec, and we know mass spec really, really well. You should expect us to continue to look for such technology accelerators. But also, we're open to building our portfolio, as I mentioned earlier, both on the floor as well as the faster growth adjacencies wherever we find something relevant. But I will remind you that look, our core business is performing extremely well. And that is the number one focus to continue the commercial momentum, to continue delivering new products across our base portfolio. And as you noticed, across the LC portfolio, across the mass spec portfolio now informatics, we're seeing a drumbeat of new products that are adding on to the field. So the focus is on the core. And we are very open to looking at M&A that accelerates and sentence our position. Amol? Patrick, I mean, it's a great question. I mean, we don't have a dogma there. But it always starts with what we know how to do. So we know how to do analytical measurements. And we've turned that focus towards larger molecules and more complex molecules both in the bioseparations arena, where there are significant challenges. Even if you take mRNA as an example, in aggregation and separation of these molecules. Lipid nanoparticles or plasmids, and there, we are perfectly capable of making a difference with our internal focus and collaborations with reagents companies and people who know how to do sample prep for biologics. So I think that for me, is the perfect combination. And on the bioprocessing side, we started with a partnership where we wanted our organization to learn the whole bioprocessing domain. And now we -- as we get a better understanding, we will surely be looking at augmenting our capabilities in Indiana on the analytical front. So you will not see us going and buying a bioreactor or a filtration company but you will see us looking at better analytical techniques to elucidate the structure and properties of these complex molecules, but it's a mix. So it's a heavy focus on organic investments, where relevant partnerships and where we see opportunities that beat up the separations of these molecules or as was characterized bioprocessing better, we will be active in the M&A space. Thank you. Thank you all for your participation and your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our first quarter 2022 call which is currently anticipated on May 3, 2022. Thank you and have a wonderful day."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of 836 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 8% in constant currency and an increase of 6% as reported. We had a record instrument sales this quarter, which increased 12% versus prior year and 8% on a two year stack basis. Despite six fewer calendar days, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 3% for the quarter. Chemistry revenues were up 5% and service revenues were up 2%, both of which had tough comparisons in the prior year. The six fewer calendar days in the quarter, translated to a growth headwind of approximately 6% for recurring revenue and approximately 3% for total revenue. For the full year, sales grew by about 16% in constant currency and 18% as reported, recurring revenues grew 11% with chemistry up 15% and service up 9%, while instrument sales grew 23%, driven by strong customer demand and new product introductions. Our two-year stacked constant currency sales growth was 7.5% for Q4 and 7% for the second half of 2021 versus 6.5% for the first half. This acceleration underscores our good commercial momentum heading into 2022. Looking ahead, comparing 2022 to 2021, there is one fewer day in the first quarter, no change in the second or third quarters and one additional day in the fourth quarter. Now I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter came in as expected at 58%. On a full year basis, gross margin was 58.5% compared to 57.4% in the prior year with improvements driven primarily by volume leverage and a 30 basis points tailwind from FX. Moving down the P&L for Q4 operating expenses increased by approximately 12% on a constant currency basis and include an increase of approximately 7% due to the normalization of our prior year COVID-related cost actions. For the year, operating expenses were approximately 18% higher in constant currency and include an increase of 15% due to the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost actions. In the quarter and for the full year, our effective operating tax rate was 14.4% and 13.8%, respectively. For the full year, our effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points due to a favorable change in our income mix by jurisdiction. Our average share count came in at 61.4 million shares, which is about 1.1 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 1% to $3.67 in comparison to $3.65 last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the normalization of prior year COVID-related cost reductions, non-GAAP EPS increased 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $3.52 compared to $3.49 last year. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was up 24% at $11.20 versus $9.05 in the prior year. On a GAAP basis, full year earnings per share was $11.17 versus $8.36 a year ago, the increase was driven primarily by sales volume, partially offset by the normalization of our COVID-related cost action. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow capital deployment on our balance sheet, we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow was 187 million after funding 45 million of capital expenditures, excluded from the free cash flow was 9 million related to the investments in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and 5 million in costs relating to one-time litigation settlement. For the full year, free cash flow was 675 million, with approximately $0.24 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. In the fourth quarter, accounts receivable DSOs came in at 66 days, down four days compared to the fourth quarter of last year and down five days compared to the last quarter. Inventory DIO decreased by nine days, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Given higher sales volumes and our proactive measures to secure supply, inventory increased by 52 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 448,000 shares of our common stock for 156 million in Q4. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was 945 million with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about one. Our capital deployment priorities are investing for growth, maintaining balance sheet strength and flexibility and returning capital to shareholders along with focus on deploying capital to well thought out attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 11. In 2021, our momentum has progressively accelerated, driven by a robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we head into 2022, we expect our momentum to continue and that we will be able to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and believe that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. These dynamics support full year 2022 guidance of 5% to 7% constant currency sales growth. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately one percentage point, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30% to 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately 35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 61 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022 and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share have now projected in the range of $11.75 to $12. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately two percentage points at today's rates. Looking at the first quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately three percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately four percentage points at today's rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Good morning, Vijay, and thanks for the question. So look, I mean, the gross margin for Q4 came in as we had guided. And if you compare it versus prior year, the gross margin is lower because of three factors. There is a 50 basis points headwind from exchange rate. But then there were also prior year COVID cost actions that normalize this year. And then, the quarter was heavier on instruments and instruments are lower margin compared to other elements of our portfolio. So when you put those three things together, it sort of reconciles with the gross margin last year. Where we are guiding for 22 at approximately 58% is in line with what we did this year. And on the operating margin side, we are saying about 30% to 30.5%. So it's sort of slightly better than 30.2% on the top end of the range. What is in there is also the tax rate, we are saying tax rate, we are expecting 15.5%. That's higher than the tax rate we had this year, primarily because the 2017 regs have a provision in place, which requires capitalization of R&D expenses, and our x-U.S. R&D expenses when capitalized will have an impact on the guilty provisions. So that has added about a little over a percentage point to the tax rate. That's included in our guidance. I mean just to build on it, Puneet, as you know, I mean, our products are differentiated. And that's not just instruments. I mean, we have very innovative chemistry portfolio that the customers like. We have a great track record and a seamless service. And we have an informatics platform that's really valued by our customers. So that puts us in a great spot to have these discussions to with our customers walk them through what's happening in the market. And then internally, what we've done is, we're keeping a close eye on how prices are moving in the market, especially labor freight and electronic components. We are constantly training and educating our sales teams so that they are aware about what's happening on the operation side so that they can have productive dialogue with our customers. And through Q4. we've navigated that well and that gives us a lot of confidence going into 2022. Yes, thanks. That's a great question. So as we get into 2022, our focus is to drive productivity gains through various different initiatives that are in place across service productivity, operational excellence in manufacturing, both direct and indirect procurement programs, as well as things like digitization and building capability center in India. And those will provide a great amount of space for us to fund the high growth adjacencies that we've talked about. And so net of that we think, as we've said at JPMorgan conference, allows us to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. And that's what is embedded in our guide. So we've guided at 30% to 30.5% versus 30.2% for 2021. So at the higher end of the guide, you do get the 20 to 30 basis points that we had \u2013 Yes. Look, I mean, as we've traditionally seen, you would see service growth at the midpoint of the guide. Instrument growth is slightly lower than that and chemistry growth is slightly about that about two percentage points spread plus or minus. I just wanted to add on the previous question, so on the academics and government, China is one area of focus for us because if you look at China, we grew on a stack basis in [indiscernible] constant currency, industrial stack 16%. But what brought it down was academics and government. And we are laser focused on revitalizing growth in that business. There are two parts to the problem, part of it is our own commercial execution, which we are focused on. But there's also drag from the VAT reimbursement issue, which we think will progressively resolve over the course of 2022."

In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters President and CEO, Udit.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar. And good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have reported another quarter of strong, broad-based momentum across our portfolio and geographies. We first thank our over 7,000 colleagues around the globe who represent the indomitable spirit of Waters.  Our teams have remained focused on supporting our customers and developing and delivering exciting new products, despite the continuing impact of the pandemic. September 1st, marked one year since I joined the Company, and what a year it has been. I'm often asked what is different. I would first like to talk about what is the same, because that is what is giving us the ability to compete more effectively.  Our brand stands for these scientific expertise, a clear understanding of our customers' challenges, and courage to invest in game-changing innovation. This remains the same. What we have injected with our new leadership team is a stronger focus on execution, a sense of urgency and accountability. We are a work in progress, but the trend is positive. Now moving to Slide 3, which summarizes where we are on our journey.  Firstly, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with another strong quarter, delivering SPAC sales growth of 6%, showing solid business performance with minimum COVID ailment. Meanwhile, our commercial initiatives and strong traction of new products by Premier Columns and instruments and Arc HPLC were Venn positioned to deliver market plus growth through 2022.  Finally, we're building on this momentum by taking decisive steps in solving key problems that are present in higher growth adjacencies, like Biologics Manufacturing. I will now provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as commentary on our end markets geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in did you guys provide comments on our updated financial outlook, we will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  Moving now to slide 4, in the third quarter, our revenue grew 11% as reported, and on a constant currency basis, reflects the second continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. That is demand for our instruments and regarding revenue products. This translates to a 6% stacked cater for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant-currency basis. Year-to-date, revenue has increased 21% with the constant currency stack CAGR versus 2019, also about 6%. Our top-line growth resulted in Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, growing 23% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share have grown 39% to $7.54.  Looking more closely at our top-line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First, by operating segment, the Waters division grew 9%, while TA grew by 27%. By end-market, our largest market category Pharma, grew 16%, industrial grew 9%, while academic and government declined by 11%. In Pharma, we saw a broad-based continued strength in sales across customer segments, geographies and applications.  Spend was both in small molecule and large molecule applications, which both grew in mid-teens for the quarter. industrial, growth was reasonably broad. And next our beauty business, which saw strong growth globally internal micro Calvin imagery and Realogy. Turning to academic and government, which is about 10% of our business, continued strength in Europe was offset by softer performance in China and other regions. Moving off last year's performance by geography on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas grew 16%, with the U.S. growing 13%, sales in Europe grew 8%, sales in Asia grew 8%, with India over 40%, and China sales were down 3%.  Now to the bit of clarification on China. Demand remains very healthy, as does the execution of our initiatives. A shipment of approximately $12 million got delayed at an airport in the last few days of the quarter due to a third-party shipping issue and has been delivered in the first few days of the fourth quarter. Looking, therefore, at China orders for the quarter, this was up mid-teens, year-over-year.  So, really no challenge from a demand perspective. In the U.S., growth was led by a broad-based continued strength in our pharma and industrial-end markets. In pharma, we saw strength across our instrument and Galaxy portfolios. In Industrial, our Waters and [Indiscernible] businesses both saw strong growth. In Europe, demand remains robust across all end markets with continued strength in pharma, industrial, and academic, and government. For the quarter, India was our fastest-growing market, driven by very strong growth in instrument sales to our common customers.\nCaspar Tudor: As you know, India is primarily a small molecule and generic market for export, and this is indicative of continued strength in global pharmaceutical demand for small molecule drugs. At products and services, customer demand for our instruments, remained strong, after an invested first half of the year, when recurring dividends also continued to see sustained growth.  Overall, instrument sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by robust demand on improved commercial execution, new product contribution, and instruments replacement. In LC, the newly released Arc HPLC continued to see strong growth and uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and the ACQUITY, especially for applications in novel modalities like mRNA and Biologics remains solid.\nUdit Batra: The strength we're seeing in our LC instrument portfolio remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables and service. In mass spec, demand strength from pharma, customers continued with a strong demand for our single-quads, led by users for Oligo and Biologics purification, as well as strength in our Tandem-quads used in late-stage drug development.  We're also encouraged by early interest in our SELECT SERIES MRT Time-of-flight platform, which delivered highest quality resolution at fast speeds. Now for recurring revenues Chemistry sales grew 13% driven by an increase in utilization of our pharma customers, as well as strength in our industrial end markets. Demand for our new Premier Columns remain strong, while our e-commerce initiative is progressing and making it easier for our customers to do business with us.  So far this year, our chemistry consumables have grown almost double-digits when compared to the -- compared to our 2019 [Indiscernible] We're pleased that our Premier Technology is continuing to provide important benefits in separation and certification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules, given its unique ability to reduce selected binding of plasmids and mRNA to various surfaces. Service also grew double-digits again this quarter, even as last year's comps have become tougher. On a two-year stack basis, service grew 7% in constant currency for the quarter and 6% year-to-date.  By focusing on our value proposition and commercial execution, we have seen an increase in service fan attachment rates and revenues. Finally, DA had its -- had a great quarter with sales up almost 30% as demand has rebounded with strong growth across all regions. DA instrument sales have grown at 8% on a 2-year stack basis so far this year, driven by strong demand for our common instruments used in the analysis of advanced materials, as well as microperimetry instrument demand for our pharma and academic customers.  Moving now to slide 6, let me now focus on why we believe that we will continue to deliver market plus growth. I think you're used to seeing these initiatives, so let me use the same frame, starting from the left-hand side of the slide. In 2021, we expect our instruments investment initiatives to become over $40 million, which means an incremental 10 million over 2021. The Fusion is positively impacting our service business with land companies.  Having increased by 2% so far this year, compared to the first three quarters of 2019. In 2022, we think a further 100 basis points of expansion in service plan, adoption is available. Growth and e-commerce adoption also remains strong, with chemistry sales to our e-commerce channels approaching roughly 30% versus the 21% we saw in 2019. We expect this to continue reaching over 35% by the end of next year. So far, this year, revenue from contract organizations has grown over 40% versus the comparable period in 2019.  Next year, expect us to grow that low double-digits for the year versus 2021. And new products continue to do well. We are just taking the example of Arc HPLC and Premier to illustrate the point here. Both Arc HPLC and Premier continue to be strong drivers with over 45 million revenue expected from these sources for this year in total in separate and unseparate to the replacement initiative. 2022, we are expecting this number to be over $60 million. So in all these initiatives alone should give us approximately 1% over our base business growth for 2022, which we upon our beliefs in market fast growth rates.  Moving now to Slide 7, we operate -- we operate a strong core business in healthy and [Indiscernible] end-markets. This strong foundation provides us a platform for solving critical problems facing our industry where we can bring our scientific expertise and product portfolio capabilities. I would like to say that our 3 years of focus, which also happened to be in high-growth end markets both in the Biologics arena, on the reagent side and bio separations.  We believe there are significant problems to solve in separating and purifying these newer modalities. Having a deeper understanding of reagents, coupled with our chemistry expertise, will allow us to solve these problems. Second, in bioprocessing, the largest challenge I cited as an engineer in bioprocessing, versus small molecule processing, was that once you defined the process, you got stuck with it, because it wasn't in a drug master file. We have to decouple the process from the product. Separately, the process development timescale, our number was a small molecule, given the sheer complexity of attributes you need to measure. A simple and robust tool that can measure multiple absolutes is a potential solution.  We believe that the BioAccord is the right LC-MS tool that can begin to address this challenge. Third area is diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe, again, mass spec has a significant role to play here. Moving now onto slide 8, let me illustrate what I mean by sharing what we're doing to solve some of the key problems in bioprocessing. Last week, we announced a partnership with Cytori's, a leader in bioprocessing.  If you could combine our waters BIO4 system as a bioprocess analyzer with Cytori's and their bioreactors, giving scientist both faster and at-line direct access to our launch quantity characterization information. Scientists across Cytori's, Waters, and some of our customers have already shown that the combined offering will shorten product development timelines considerably, making what currently takes 6 weeks to analyze down to only 2 days. It also lays the foundation for using the BioAccord as a bioprocess analyzer for process control and quality testing in the future.  BioAccord is both versatile and easy-to-use, and we expect that most of engineers will be able to master its operation within 1 to 2 weeks. In fact, one of our customers had summer intern use the BioAccord and gave raving reviews on how simple it is to use. I'm also an engineer who has been out of the lab for many years, and I was able to learn quickly. Resulting configuration with our direct analysis of rough substance, not just cell-culture media while targeting over 250 cell-culture media analyzed. Separately, we also announced a multi-year collaboration with the University of Delaware to develop technology for analytical characterization of manufacturing processes for Biologics and Novel modalities.  [Indiscernible] partnerships, researchers from both Waters and the university of Delaware would identify and develop solutions. That can provide better aseptic sampling, makes center and analytical instrument improvements, and develop data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to characterize biological manufacturing processes in order to drive improvements in quality, deals, efficiency, and process control.  In summary, 2021, so far, has been a very successful year for Waters. We are laser-focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions have rebounded solidly from dynamic loss. Meanwhile, I'm convinced of the great opportunity that lies ahead of us in higher growth adjacencies to impact and deliver value by extending our scientific expertise and product portfolio towards helping customers solve the most complex problems in our industry. With that, I'd like to pass the call Operator Amol for a deeper review of third quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $659 million in the Third Quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%. Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 11% for the quarter. While instrument sales increased 10%. [Indiscernible] revenues were up 13% and service revenues were up 10%.  As we noted in our last earnings call, that recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, that are 6 fewer days in fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020. Now, I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior-year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9% compared to 55.8% in the third quarter of 2020. Improvement was driven primarily by one leverage and revenues. Acquired exchange benefit in the quarter was about 1%. More inbound to P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 17% on a constant-currency basis and on a reported basis.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs due to the normalization of prior-year cost actions, as well as higher variable compensation on the higher sales volume. In the quarter on our effective operating tax rate was 11.7%, a decrease from last year due to some inevitable or specific discrete items. Excluding the impact of these discrete items, our year-to-date tax rate is consistent with the prior year.  Our average share count coming in at 61.9 million shares or about 400 thousand less than the third quarter of last year. As a result of our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased 23% to $2.66 in comparison to $2.16 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully-diluted share increased to $2.60, compared to $2.03 last year.  A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in the press release issued this morning and the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and exclude special items. In the third quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $140 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures.  Excluded from the free cash flow was $12 million, relating to investment in our content precision chemistry operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased to [Indiscernible] million and approximately $0.25 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. In the third quarter, accounts receivable DSO, came in at 71 days, down 5 days compared to the third quarter of last year. And down 2 days compared to the last quarter [Indiscernible] DIO decreased by 13 days compared to the third quarter of last year. Given the higher sales volume our proactive measures to secure a supply in monthly increased by $62 million in comparison to the prior year.  We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 369,000 shares of our common stock for 151 million in Q3. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was 958 million, with net debt to EBITDA ratio about one. Our capital deployment priority [Indiscernible] to invest in growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, return capital to shareholders, and to deploy capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities.  As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you with some update on our parts for 2021 on slide 11. Throughout this year, we've seen good momentum driven by robust, end-market demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue and expect our near-term growth initiatives to continue to contribute meaningfully to our performance. Looking at the fourth quarter, the comparison is more challenging.  As it was the first quarter in our transformation journey, and was further favorably impacted by forced lockdown, elevated year-end budget plus spending. In addition, we have six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. These dynamics supports updated full-year 2021 guidance and 15% to 16% constant currency sales growth. At current exchange rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1% decline, resulting in full-year reported sales growth guidance of 16% to 17%.  Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% to 59%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. We expect our full-year net interest expense to be $34 million, and full-year net rate to be 14% to 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately $62 million. Our share [Indiscernible] purchase program will also continue into Q4 and will provide quarterly updates as appropriate [Indiscernible] August together on a non-GAAP basis [Indiscernible] 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $10.94 to $11.04.  This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 2% points at today's rate and assumes no material at worse supply impact from COVID. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 5% to 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2% decline, resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales look guidance of 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3% points at today's rate. And assumes no material had worse supply impact from COVID. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. Before I wrap things up, I would like to make a few comments on our ESG efforts and our core principles to fuel innovation and make a positive impact. This includes doing our part to reduce our environmental footprint and leave the world better than we found it. Being representative of a diverse society we live in and providing effective governance that enhances long-term shareholder value pack. You will see more of our progress in each of these areas in our 2021 sustainability report coming out later this month.  Turning to Slide 10. I was particularly moved recently by the new internship program we developed with team New England, designed to increase access to stem education for students of all backgrounds. Over the course of six weeks,we give high-school students, a hands-on learning experience with a mix of science, business, and soft skills. Over 70 Waters employees were involved who gave practical exposure and mentorship. We look forward to continuing these efforts in the future. In summary, we continue to be pleased with our performance this year.  We're sustaining our commercial momentum with our initiatives which continue to perform well and should provide a multi-year benefit as we continue to strengthen our core. They're continuing to crack 6% on a two-year CAGR tax 6% on a two-year CAGR for our revenue in constant currency, showing that our core is strong. Our focus on accelerating innovation to our portfolio and reaching these higher growth rate area in adjacent markets. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Thank you. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Dan Brennan Alan. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan Alan: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the call, Thanks for the questions here. Maybe first off, Udit, just on 2022, you had provided some early look here with some of the drivers, come to how they're going to impact -- and just wondering if we think ahead, given the comp becoming off of for 2021, what's the right way to think about the in the early look for 2022 here? Consensus had you growing organically about 5%, which would imply a pretty nice acceleration on a 2-year stack basis.\nUdit Batra: Thanks for the question [Indiscernible] Look for us just to -- just to this year. I mean, we're [Indiscernible] at 6% plus sort of stack growth rate. So really the base business is doing rather nicely and we would seem that the transformation is now hitting its strike. So the base business should continue to track along those lines. Now, we've always had market plus and what gives us conviction that it's going to be market [Indiscernible] the initiatives that we've outlined, including the replacement, including additional penetration in different channels, and better launch of new products.  So wherever the market is, we expect them to be market plus, given the initiatives. And in terms of what you should expect for next year, again, the same logic applies, right? As the market has four, we should be for Black diversified, we should be fighting, and at 6, we should be 6 plus. And there's no reason to believe that the market should slowdown.  All our end markets are doing super well, I mean, you saw that year-to-date both pharma and industrial are tracking close to 20% on a two-year basis. They're well ahead of what we've seen over the history of Waters. So we really good going into the next year and we have concrete initiatives that make us believe that we should be [Indiscernible]\nDan Brennan Alan: Great. And then, just maybe as a follow-up, you've been at the helm about a year plus right now. You've done, obviously, you've outlined some areas for improvement which you've executed on in terms of new product, commercial execution, customer identification, where you were lagging, how do you think about the evolution of your impact on the business? Should we expect at some point here, as we enter 2022, that there's going to be possibly a new wave of initiatives? Just thinking through what the next leg is for Waters. And related to that, just wondering how M&A fits into that? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Dan, thanks. Thanks for the question. But first, we have to make sure we do more of the same, right? I mean, and that's -- that I feel really good about, especially with the leadership of John Pratt and [Indiscernible], really executing even further on our initiatives. Second, feel very good about our ability to bring in new products to the market. They have tremendous, tremendous traction, right, especially the products that we launched recently, Arc HPLC, the Premier Columns, both adding significantly to the top line. and the MRT.  The SELECT SERIES MRT has a lot of interest from our customers across proteomics, across imaging, and across many different segments. We're feeling very good about what our pipeline is contributing and there is more to come there. And finally to your question on M&A, look, we've outlined the areas of growth we're interested in. And I think what you will see is that we're not just interested in entering these areas. Really meaning we are really thinking hard about what are the other key problems to solve.  So as an example, with bioprocessing, as an engineer and freshly [Indiscernible] after finishing my PhD days into my new job, I was actually doing manufacturing plant where we were still I manufacturing vaccines using chicken embryo eggs. So a fact with eggs, opening them up, and I will tell you the rest of the process. The process was designing many, many years ago, probably decades ago.  And the reason that you were -- that is -- and that's how MMR vaccines are [Indiscernible] manufacturer today, why we much better technology in some culture to be able to manufacture the same type of vaccine. And the reason for that sort of conservatism is that the process and the products are indistinguishable in the drug master file that you filed of to Biologics. And that's something that we really want to work on. We believe that our collaboration with the University of Delaware will help us make strides in that direction.  And I'm super excited about what we've just announced with Sartorius. I mean Sartorius is a leader in bioprocessing and they have probably the deepest penetration of small early-stage bioreactors that are used for clone selection. And that collaboration has two benefits. One we're able to take the BioAccord and improve a process that takes about six weeks to down to two days. And that's been shown by -- in collaboration with Sartorius scientists and our scientists, as well as customers, so very excited about that.  There are several 100 Amber [Indiscernible] area where we would have not otherwise entered. I mean, in this case, we want to enter with the capabilities that people feel extremely good about the initiatives. So in summary, continuing the commercial momentum, second, recharging innovation, and third, looking to enter these faster growth areas through partnerships, and increasing the open to M&A, if it makes sense. But I remind you that for M&A, we are a financially disciplined Company, so you won't see us jumping in [Indiscernible] into something that [Indiscernible]\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. Udit, maybe I'll start with China. You noted the $12 million shipment delay, it doesn't sound like you're flagging any demand issues, but I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in that market and then any comments on supply?\nUdit Batra: China year-to-date is over 30% growth. Only second to India in organic growth. From a demand perspective, for the quarter we were up mid-teens. And unfortunately, the shipment got stuck in the last few days of the quarter, which made it to our customers now. And if you included that into the Q3 numbers, it will be high single-digits to low-teens for China growth. So really, nothing to flat from a China perspective. In fact, I would say very happy with our new leader in China who's been implementing initiatives really really well, Arc HPLC has great traction.  We have built really strong commercial momentum even in our food and environmental markets [Indiscernible]. we are extremely good about where we are in China, so nothing is really to flag from a demand perspective. And on your question on supply chain, look, like everybody else in fact -- like everybody else, we are seeing constraints in shipping in different boards that appear sporadically, right? We don't think it's a systemic issue. It's a sporadic issue, and we're not unique in experiencing those challenges.  In fact, I was with a few colleagues from different industries last week, and virtually, everyone is experiencing sort of a little bit of unpredictable changes in supply chains. So we're not immune to that, and I think if somebody tells you that they are -- that's why we're not shipping as much. And then the other two pieces are of the supply chain s that are being talked a lot are are inflation; we do see inflation specifically in U.S. labor.  But nothing we haven't been able to offset by price increases with our customers. So hopefully that gives you enough color on how we feel to China. Really nothing to flag, no problem at all from a demand perspective, and from a supply chain perspective. Feeling what everybody else feels, really happy with the way our teams are working through some of these issues and starting on prices where it makes sense to our customers.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then for the follow-up, academic government is only 10%, but it was down 11%. Can you touch on what you're seeing there and do you expect that to turn this fourth quarter with the budget flush?\nUdit Batra: And then Tycho, for AMG, I mean, we do year-to-date growing up 36%. And if you look at the consumables revenue, that's tracking nicely. So there's activity across our customers. So tracking in double-digits, so the recurring revenues are still growing double-digit with other end-market. So nothing to point out systemically overall, if you look at the market. Now, the performance is a bit different by region.  Europe is doing extremely well. But as China and the U.S. are bit slower, and that has to do with [Indiscernible] One, I do have pointed out, academic endowment is a small portion of our business and historically has not been a huge focus for Waters. We have, with John 's arrival, we had started to increase our focus on that segment, as well. And if you think about the instruments part of the business, that really depends on the [Indiscernible] relationships and customer relationships.  And this over time -- and pharma slowed down in many markets. And in Europe, we've come out of the gates very well. We've started to reestablish those relationships and you'll see the impact on the results year-to-date. In U.S. and China, that's work in progress and we'll give you updates as we go along. I'm optimistic with the activity I see, especially on the e-commerce and in procurement. And you see the results in our consumables business. And on the instruments side, we're improving [Indiscernible] relationships. I expect that to return, as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is Vijay Kumar, Evercore?\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, good morning and thanks for taking my question. Udit, that one for you. The $12 million shipping delay in 2Q. What segment did that impact? Was the instrument impact or government, academia. I'm curious how do you risk as Q4 from any supply chain disruption, I'm a bit curious which visibility you have.\nUdit Batra: First Vijay, good morning, and similar to what I just said to Tycho, really nothing to be concerned about from a demand perspective in China, that the $12 million have made it to the customers. And it is a bit spread, that it's -- what it's basically all instruments. It's not any consumables, so it's all instruments and it's made it to the customers. A bit spread across the different customer segments online, industrial, as well as academic and government.  So nothing one segment, feeling more pain. And in terms of how we're dealing with these issues, look and, have a superb supply chain department. We have extreme transparency on the shipments and the timing of the shipments. And we started to build inventory where we see order spikes in the different regions. And so we feel that we should be able to manage through the volatility that you are seeing in different [Indiscernible].\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Udit. I did have one on gross margins. 3Q gross margin is very consistent with 2Q, but if we recall, FX has an impact on you guys, at the gross margin line. Given the 200 basis points headwind in Q4, any comments on FX impact on gross margins either in Q4 or as we look through fiscal '22?\nAmol Chaubal: So we tell you -- we do expect our gross margins in Q4 to be about 58% to 59%, right? And we've seen so far in Q3, as we said, 1% tailwind onto cross margin. Looking ahead, I mean, the dollar has strengthened and we do have -- most currencies we are operationally has to accept bound and that's the currency where we are exposed. But other than that, we've sort of included that in our guide, and that's where you see BDO close to $0.10 headwind on EPS versus the last earnings call in our Q4 EPS guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering that -- just get a little bit more color on the shipment you flagged in China, the 12 million. So that was delivered in October. Obviously, the supply chain dynamic seems to be getting incrementally more challenging each week. So was just curious what you'd -- how things are going there, and do you think -- does your guidance contemplate any orders could slip from 4Q and 2022 as well?\nUdit Batra: Morning, Jack. Look, nothing that we have visibility on that will go from Q4 to Q1. As I said, there is increased inventory in the different regions where we are seeing the demand going extremely, extremely well. And from an overall perspective, the $12 million was shipped rather promptly in Q4, right? It's just unfortunate that hinge on the days of Doug and the shipping throughout that Doug do it at the end of the quarter.  So I don't see anything that gives us visibility at this point that would tell us that they would be an impact in Q4. And in terms of what is within our hands or you heard me talk about earlier, the extreme transparency that we have on supply chain, the processes that are much, much improved over the last year, and then finally, the increased inventory is a different reason. So feel reasonably comfortable that we should be able to manage a rather ambitious end of the year.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then, was just curious about labor trends. You called out the fact that you are now above -- recovering from the pre -pandemic levels. Was just curious if you felt like there was more spend coming in 4Q and just maybe overall competition for labor, how you think your managing, in terms of retention?\nAmol Chaubal: Yeah, look, U.S. labor continues to be a place where we're seeing inflationary pressures, right? I think with a strong HR function, we've put a lot of measures in place to reduce attrition and sustained talent, right? However, that doesn't play out so much in terms of cost and operating expenses into Q4. What -- as you model Q4, what you have to keep in mind is Q4 is a heavy revenue partner for us. And that results in commission payment accrued heavily in Q4, which is why it's typically seen as historically operating expenses especially as G&A on every other Q4. And that's reflected in archives.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks, guys. Udit. maybe one on the '22 commentary. You said you appreciate you're expecting to continue to grow above market. When we look at 2021, it feels like one of the accelerants for you guys with the replacement cycle, I think last quarter you talked about maybe setting up as an opportunity for you guys to continue on that front or was that mainly condensed into 2021 when we think about what the growth rate could look like there?\nUdit Batra: Patrick, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, I was learning baseball, like if using a baseball analogy and people have talked sense into me to start talking in revenue numbers. So that's why we put that slide together to slide 6. Brad remarks. Look [Indiscernible] off what save 1% to 1.5% extra [Indiscernible] on a stack basis. Due to the initiatives and the initiatives we're not just the instruments that basement. We saw solid attachment increase of aftermarket. We saw e-commerce adoption growth from 20-27-28%. Contact of [Indiscernible] grew, which was a new channel for us, grew roughly 40% on a two-year basis. And new product contribution also did extreme good.  So across-the-board 1% to 1.5%, sort of benefits, or what I would say the base growth and robust end markets. Next year, we think that's roughly 1% versus a base market growth of whatever the base market goes with lease. So for instrument replacement, this year, we had roughly 30 million or so of benefit. Next year to be $40 million, which is 10 million incremental, right. So that's how I would think about it, right.  So for service, 200 basis points, another 100 basis points on top. So the 200 basis points already benefits us next year. And then e-commerce goes, and anything we can read the charts. So I think that for me is how I would think about 2022 and beyond, right? And as you think about what's happening beyond, this is now part of our CRM system.  This is part of our execution that John Pratt and Jianqing are implementing, right. So we now have the full list of HPLC, UPLC, as well as the Tandem-quads in the CRM system that our reps are going through step-by-step and replacing. And this will continue next year, and will go on into the year after. Same thing is true for our service attachment rates. We know where the attachment rates are.  We're using that database to now go after it. So it has become part of the DNA of the organization, and I think that gives me confidence that we will be able to accelerate also next year. And then finally, new products, as I mentioned are doing very well. MRT has just started to pick up a lot of interest, we've talked about Arc HPLC and Premier doing very well. So we feel really good about that 1% incremental over what would be any sort of market growth.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful. Appreciate that. And then maybe just a quick one on the industrial market [Indiscernible] a pretty good results there. It's has been a little more mixed across the sector, you could fuse talk about what you're seeing there and expectations going forward?\nUdit Batra: I mean, across all end markets, right? I mean, you look at pharma and all you'd look at Industrial. Industrial, it's roughly 6% to 6.5% stack growth, right? Historically, that's been 4% to 5%. So we're [Indiscernible] even bigger acceleration, relatively speaking in Industrial versus you seeing [Indiscernible] pharma. And I must say, we're seeing extremely, extremely good performance out of the TA business.  So it's nice performance across the different customer segments, be it in advance materials, be it batteries, where we test studies for renewable batteries. And I don't need to tell you why that's important these days. Electronics that's going in the high teens, double-digits, the Life Science part of our TA business is also growing nicely. So in TA, we're seeing really, really good momentum, and again on a stack basis, even outpacing the overall business of the 8% or so growth.  So I think industrial, we feel that our customers have found a way to work despite the pandemic. Our service engineers and our sales teams have access to many of these customers, initially virtually, but in many regions, increasingly also, physically, our service engineers both across Waters and TA are actually more welcome at our customer side. And many of our -- many of their own employees. So industrial is -- has picked up nice, strengthened. It's true across all geographies. China is doing well. U.S., Europe, the rest of Asia also doing really quite well. That's the real area of strength, and we're lucky to have a business like TA that's pointed in that direction.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.\nMichael Ryskin: Thanks for taking my question. This is my question on for Derik. I want to follow up a little bit on the instrument performance you saw in the quarter. I was wondering if you could break out anything you saw different in terms of the LC versus mass SPAC. And it's generally sort of tying it back to the academic and government question. I'm wondering if that was more on the mass SPAC side of me, sort of how do you see some of those new product introductions playing out this quarter and going forward?\nUdit Batra: Actually, overall -- and again, I talked more in terms of stack growth, the estimated growth for the year is roughly 30% and mass SPAC doing extremely well as even higher than 30% mass spect psyche Shiloh's 30%. So nothing that you will between the two sort of product platforms. But I think it makes more sense to talk about it on a stack basis. And historically, Waters have seen instrument growth between 3% and 4%. We've sort of steadily now year-to-date stack fuel is steadily on 5%.  So really nice momentum. And this is through both of course, as well as mass specs and nothing really can sort of differentiate the two. Now, you asked about mass spec in particular. In mass spec, the demand is driven by across all our portfolios for us, I mean, across users in IVAS mass spec across our Tandem-quads, which are both used -- with the single quarter used for intact masks and also our Tandem-quads that are used in development, as well as food and environmental.  And then of course, as I mentioned, the bioprocessing yields momentum and a lot of interest in the bioprocessing arena. So mass spec is going from strength to strength. Coming to the second part of your question on new products, as I pointed out on the -- in the prepared remarks right on -- just focusing on HPLC for a minute.  Arc HPLC, as well as the premier technology, which includes columns, as well as the application of this unique technology to our instruments as that to roughly $45 million in sales in 2021, we expect that to go up to $60 plus million, sort of $15 million or so incremental. That's in the anticipate on March SPAC. New applications from BioAccord, I already mentioned that in the prepared remarks.  And the MRT has a lot of interest from many of our customers, especially ones who want to use it in the proteomics space and for imaging with our DESI technology, which can be used under ambient conditions which is quite unique. Again, new products, what is that? How HQ, introducing game-changing new products. I think what we're doing differently is just making sure that there is a lot of collection once we launch these products. And they're not just [Indiscernible].\nMichael Ryskin: Quick follow-up on the OpEx side of [Indiscernible] both came in a little better than we expected our model. I was just wondering if there's any onetime effect there. I know that probably played a role that as well being less of a tailwind. Just wondering if you could comment on any trends there. And the 12 million shipment that got the weight of 4Q in China, how should that flow through the model? Is that about a $0.05 to $0.10 benefit to 4Q EPS?\nAmol Chaubal: Yeah. So on the two questions, the first one, there's no one-time activity in R&D or SG&A. So it's pretty straightforward. On the 12 million shipment that got delayed and I mean, you could assume it's largely instruments and modeling that instrument in gross margin.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink, your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So first one is just I wanted to clarify. Obviously, it's instrumentation was strong last quarter. And if you pull in this $12 million order back into 3Q, that would be strong this quarter as well, since -- just wanted to understand if there is sort of application-wise, what is driving the instrumentation sale?  And maybe just if you could elaborate a little bit, if there was any in terms of QA/QC of vaccines, maybe the analysis of mRNA cap structure, there were some applications, notes published by Waters teams around that. So I just wanted to understand if you're working on QA/QC side of the proteins or mRNA Vaccines, or what does the applications that are driving the instrumentation growth that we've seen here over the last few quarters?\nUdit Batra: Look, the instrument growth is driven by strong, robust end markets at our commercial execution. Again, it's our initiatives, the age replacement via your products and your question is, what is increased applications. And I would break it into two parts. One, we had indeed seen increased application of our technology in oligonucleotide mRNA. So claims to sign that somebody from the leading mRNA companies, Cambridge recently and they basically said, look, huge aggregation problems with plasmics with us, help them solve these problems by using Premier and to [Indiscernible] by using LC-MS to elucidate the [Indiscernible] of the molecules themselves.  So good application there. And a lot of them being in development, in discovery. And hopefully increasingly in QA/QC. Second area that I would comment on is the wider application of the BioAccord if you'll recall, product was initially launched, really focused on LC-MS, which we still \u2013 in QA/QC, we still believe that LC-MS has a strong place in QA/QC provided, the instrument that you have is simple, robust, and fast, and give you faster results.  But, that same value proposition is equally relevant in early stage development of complex Biologics. And we're seeing really good application there. We demonstrated with Sartorius that some experiments that take 6 weeks can now be turned around within two days. And this has been replicated in Sartorius ' labs, our labs and in several customer labs. As you can imagine, there's a ton of excitement on that front. And the BioAccord is rather unique here, the results are fast. It's a simple-to-use instrument, even somebody like me can use it.  And it provides you a wide range of results, not just on cell-culture media applications, where it is much wider than any sort of application used today, but also on the drug substance. So seeing wider application of our technologies, I'm really excited about where LC-MS is going -- especially the BioAccord with its simplicity and robustness, [Indiscernible] early stage development of [Indiscernible].\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you could provide a breakout of growth in LC and MS separately, here in the quarter? I don't think you provided those numbers. I missed them if you did. And I guess broadly, it seems like the Waters instrument business was a bit lighter than expected. I mean, any additional color you can provide on maybe what drove this would be helpful was it largely timing-related or is it more reflection of possibly a normalization in orders?\nUdit Batra: The second question, on a year-to-date instrument growth is roughly 30%, quite good about that -- I don't know [Indiscernible] In Q3, we saw nice growth, double-digit again on instruments with [Indiscernible] comps in Q3 for last year already. So double-digit growth across the 2 pieces of -- 2 lines of instruments as we [Indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis and the quarter is the same, LC grew an excess of 30% mass spec in the mid 20s.  So really nothing to choose between the 2 instrument backlogs, makes less sense to look at it quarter-by-quarter, given the instrument trajectory. But again, nothing to choose between the two field, that both LC and Mass Spec have significant momentum in Q3 and year-to-date. So, and also going into Q4, we're really feeling very good about where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. I guess just first on the instrument side of the business, revenue was down about 8% constant currency last year. Do you think you've largely recaptured that revenue at this point, or is there still some of the makeup, or do you think there's some that is just revenue that won't be recaptured. Will just be curious how you would allocate across those three buckets.\nUdit Batra: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I think on the instrument side, we really feel that we're on a very, very good track. I mean, if you just look at historical averages, right, I mean, 2020 can confound they've given all the multiple impact on a stack basis. So mostly nicely in excess of 5%, close to 6% in some cases, for our instrument business, and historically that average for Waters and across the industries between 4%.  So really nicely year of the historical averages. And in terms of how much have they floored back, when you think that -- just looking at three sort of data points, one, comparing our stacks growth rates, move instrument and consumables with the rest of the industry where they were comparable products, we feel very good that we are operating well in -- well ahead of the market, that's market plus performance on -- that's the first data point that makes us fee that we're clawing back rather nicely.  Second, we have the loss ratio that we measure internally. Those have been tracking ahead of historical averages for the last 4 quarters. And finally, there are public reports that are available which are either lot of idiosyncratic because they change the definitions [Indiscernible] also are doing pretty well as on our market share.  So we [Indiscernible] very good about how we're reversing rates [Indiscernible] our footage?. And we are a work in progress, there's a lot more to do, a lot more opportunity as well. A lot of applications for our instruments, a lot of -- lot more penetration to be [Indiscernible] but we're really good so far, better that we had.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the questions session of today's call.\nUdit Batra: Thank you very much for your participation and questions and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our fourth quarter 2021 call, which is going to be on February 1st, 2021. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. This does conclude today's call. You may disconnect your lines and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar. And good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We have reported another quarter of strong, broad-based momentum across our portfolio and geographies. We first thank our over 7,000 colleagues around the globe who represent the indomitable spirit of Waters.  Our teams have remained focused on supporting our customers and developing and delivering exciting new products, despite the continuing impact of the pandemic. September 1st, marked one year since I joined the Company, and what a year it has been. I'm often asked what is different. I would first like to talk about what is the same, because that is what is giving us the ability to compete more effectively.  Our brand stands for these scientific expertise, a clear understanding of our customers' challenges, and courage to invest in game-changing innovation. This remains the same. What we have injected with our new leadership team is a stronger focus on execution, a sense of urgency and accountability. We are a work in progress, but the trend is positive. Now moving to Slide 3, which summarizes where we are on our journey.  Firstly, we're sustaining our commercial momentum with another strong quarter, delivering SPAC sales growth of 6%, showing solid business performance with minimum COVID ailment. Meanwhile, our commercial initiatives and strong traction of new products by Premier Columns and instruments and Arc HPLC were Venn positioned to deliver market plus growth through 2022.  Finally, we're building on this momentum by taking decisive steps in solving key problems that are present in higher growth adjacencies, like Biologics Manufacturing. I will now provide a brief overview of our third quarter operating results, as well as commentary on our end markets geographies and technologies. Amol will then review our financial results in did you guys provide comments on our updated financial outlook, we will then open up the phone lines to take your questions.  Moving now to slide 4, in the third quarter, our revenue grew 11% as reported, and on a constant currency basis, reflects the second continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets. That is demand for our instruments and regarding revenue products. This translates to a 6% stacked cater for the quarter versus 2019 on a constant-currency basis. Year-to-date, revenue has increased 21% with the constant currency stack CAGR versus 2019, also about 6%. Our top-line growth resulted in Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share of $2.66, growing 23% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share have grown 39% to $7.54.  Looking more closely at our top-line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First, by operating segment, the Waters division grew 9%, while TA grew by 27%. By end-market, our largest market category Pharma, grew 16%, industrial grew 9%, while academic and government declined by 11%. In Pharma, we saw a broad-based continued strength in sales across customer segments, geographies and applications.  Spend was both in small molecule and large molecule applications, which both grew in mid-teens for the quarter. industrial, growth was reasonably broad. And next our beauty business, which saw strong growth globally internal micro Calvin imagery and Realogy. Turning to academic and government, which is about 10% of our business, continued strength in Europe was offset by softer performance in China and other regions. Moving off last year's performance by geography on a constant currency basis, sales in the Americas grew 16%, with the U.S. growing 13%, sales in Europe grew 8%, sales in Asia grew 8%, with India over 40%, and China sales were down 3%.  Now to the bit of clarification on China. Demand remains very healthy, as does the execution of our initiatives. A shipment of approximately $12 million got delayed at an airport in the last few days of the quarter due to a third-party shipping issue and has been delivered in the first few days of the fourth quarter. Looking, therefore, at China orders for the quarter, this was up mid-teens, year-over-year.  So, really no challenge from a demand perspective. In the U.S., growth was led by a broad-based continued strength in our pharma and industrial-end markets. In pharma, we saw strength across our instrument and Galaxy portfolios. In Industrial, our Waters and [Indiscernible] businesses both saw strong growth. In Europe, demand remains robust across all end markets with continued strength in pharma, industrial, and academic, and government. For the quarter, India was our fastest-growing market, driven by very strong growth in instrument sales to our common customers. The strength we're seeing in our LC instrument portfolio remains a positive indicator for sustainable future growth in consumables and service. In mass spec, demand strength from pharma, customers continued with a strong demand for our single-quads, led by users for Oligo and Biologics purification, as well as strength in our Tandem-quads used in late-stage drug development.  We're also encouraged by early interest in our SELECT SERIES MRT Time-of-flight platform, which delivered highest quality resolution at fast speeds. Now for recurring revenues Chemistry sales grew 13% driven by an increase in utilization of our pharma customers, as well as strength in our industrial end markets. Demand for our new Premier Columns remain strong, while our e-commerce initiative is progressing and making it easier for our customers to do business with us.  So far this year, our chemistry consumables have grown almost double-digits when compared to the -- compared to our 2019 [Indiscernible] We're pleased that our Premier Technology is continuing to provide important benefits in separation and certification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules, given its unique ability to reduce selected binding of plasmids and mRNA to various surfaces. Service also grew double-digits again this quarter, even as last year's comps have become tougher. On a two-year stack basis, service grew 7% in constant currency for the quarter and 6% year-to-date.  By focusing on our value proposition and commercial execution, we have seen an increase in service fan attachment rates and revenues. Finally, DA had its -- had a great quarter with sales up almost 30% as demand has rebounded with strong growth across all regions. DA instrument sales have grown at 8% on a 2-year stack basis so far this year, driven by strong demand for our common instruments used in the analysis of advanced materials, as well as microperimetry instrument demand for our pharma and academic customers.  Moving now to slide 6, let me now focus on why we believe that we will continue to deliver market plus growth. I think you're used to seeing these initiatives, so let me use the same frame, starting from the left-hand side of the slide. In 2021, we expect our instruments investment initiatives to become over $40 million, which means an incremental 10 million over 2021. The Fusion is positively impacting our service business with land companies.  Having increased by 2% so far this year, compared to the first three quarters of 2019. In 2022, we think a further 100 basis points of expansion in service plan, adoption is available. Growth and e-commerce adoption also remains strong, with chemistry sales to our e-commerce channels approaching roughly 30% versus the 21% we saw in 2019. We expect this to continue reaching over 35% by the end of next year. So far, this year, revenue from contract organizations has grown over 40% versus the comparable period in 2019.  Next year, expect us to grow that low double-digits for the year versus 2021. And new products continue to do well. We are just taking the example of Arc HPLC and Premier to illustrate the point here. Both Arc HPLC and Premier continue to be strong drivers with over 45 million revenue expected from these sources for this year in total in separate and unseparate to the replacement initiative. 2022, we are expecting this number to be over $60 million. So in all these initiatives alone should give us approximately 1% over our base business growth for 2022, which we upon our beliefs in market fast growth rates.  Moving now to Slide 7, we operate -- we operate a strong core business in healthy and [Indiscernible] end-markets. This strong foundation provides us a platform for solving critical problems facing our industry where we can bring our scientific expertise and product portfolio capabilities. I would like to say that our 3 years of focus, which also happened to be in high-growth end markets both in the Biologics arena, on the reagent side and bio separations.  We believe there are significant problems to solve in separating and purifying these newer modalities. Having a deeper understanding of reagents, coupled with our chemistry expertise, will allow us to solve these problems. Second, in bioprocessing, the largest challenge I cited as an engineer in bioprocessing, versus small molecule processing, was that once you defined the process, you got stuck with it, because it wasn't in a drug master file. We have to decouple the process from the product. Separately, the process development timescale, our number was a small molecule, given the sheer complexity of attributes you need to measure. A simple and robust tool that can measure multiple absolutes is a potential solution.  We believe that the BioAccord is the right LC-MS tool that can begin to address this challenge. Third area is diagnostics, where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection. We believe, again, mass spec has a significant role to play here. Moving now onto slide 8, let me illustrate what I mean by sharing what we're doing to solve some of the key problems in bioprocessing. Last week, we announced a partnership with Cytori's, a leader in bioprocessing.  If you could combine our waters BIO4 system as a bioprocess analyzer with Cytori's and their bioreactors, giving scientist both faster and at-line direct access to our launch quantity characterization information. Scientists across Cytori's, Waters, and some of our customers have already shown that the combined offering will shorten product development timelines considerably, making what currently takes 6 weeks to analyze down to only 2 days. It also lays the foundation for using the BioAccord as a bioprocess analyzer for process control and quality testing in the future.  BioAccord is both versatile and easy-to-use, and we expect that most of engineers will be able to master its operation within 1 to 2 weeks. In fact, one of our customers had summer intern use the BioAccord and gave raving reviews on how simple it is to use. I'm also an engineer who has been out of the lab for many years, and I was able to learn quickly. Resulting configuration with our direct analysis of rough substance, not just cell-culture media while targeting over 250 cell-culture media analyzed. Separately, we also announced a multi-year collaboration with the University of Delaware to develop technology for analytical characterization of manufacturing processes for Biologics and Novel modalities.  [Indiscernible] partnerships, researchers from both Waters and the university of Delaware would identify and develop solutions. That can provide better aseptic sampling, makes center and analytical instrument improvements, and develop data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to characterize biological manufacturing processes in order to drive improvements in quality, deals, efficiency, and process control.  In summary, 2021, so far, has been a very successful year for Waters. We are laser-focused on our commercial execution. The markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions have rebounded solidly from dynamic loss. Meanwhile, I'm convinced of the great opportunity that lies ahead of us in higher growth adjacencies to impact and deliver value by extending our scientific expertise and product portfolio towards helping customers solve the most complex problems in our industry. With that, I'd like to pass the call Operator Amol for a deeper review of third quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol? Thank you, Amol. Before I wrap things up, I would like to make a few comments on our ESG efforts and our core principles to fuel innovation and make a positive impact. This includes doing our part to reduce our environmental footprint and leave the world better than we found it. Being representative of a diverse society we live in and providing effective governance that enhances long-term shareholder value pack. You will see more of our progress in each of these areas in our 2021 sustainability report coming out later this month.  Turning to Slide 10. I was particularly moved recently by the new internship program we developed with team New England, designed to increase access to stem education for students of all backgrounds. Over the course of six weeks,we give high-school students, a hands-on learning experience with a mix of science, business, and soft skills. Over 70 Waters employees were involved who gave practical exposure and mentorship. We look forward to continuing these efforts in the future. In summary, we continue to be pleased with our performance this year.  We're sustaining our commercial momentum with our initiatives which continue to perform well and should provide a multi-year benefit as we continue to strengthen our core. They're continuing to crack 6% on a two-year CAGR tax 6% on a two-year CAGR for our revenue in constant currency, showing that our core is strong. Our focus on accelerating innovation to our portfolio and reaching these higher growth rate area in adjacent markets. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Thank you. Operator? Thanks for the question [Indiscernible] Look for us just to -- just to this year. I mean, we're [Indiscernible] at 6% plus sort of stack growth rate. So really the base business is doing rather nicely and we would seem that the transformation is now hitting its strike. So the base business should continue to track along those lines. Now, we've always had market plus and what gives us conviction that it's going to be market [Indiscernible] the initiatives that we've outlined, including the replacement, including additional penetration in different channels, and better launch of new products.  So wherever the market is, we expect them to be market plus, given the initiatives. And in terms of what you should expect for next year, again, the same logic applies, right? As the market has four, we should be for Black diversified, we should be fighting, and at 6, we should be 6 plus. And there's no reason to believe that the market should slowdown.  All our end markets are doing super well, I mean, you saw that year-to-date both pharma and industrial are tracking close to 20% on a two-year basis. They're well ahead of what we've seen over the history of Waters. So we really good going into the next year and we have concrete initiatives that make us believe that we should be [Indiscernible] Dan, thanks. Thanks for the question. But first, we have to make sure we do more of the same, right? I mean, and that's -- that I feel really good about, especially with the leadership of John Pratt and [Indiscernible], really executing even further on our initiatives. Second, feel very good about our ability to bring in new products to the market. They have tremendous, tremendous traction, right, especially the products that we launched recently, Arc HPLC, the Premier Columns, both adding significantly to the top line. and the MRT.  The SELECT SERIES MRT has a lot of interest from our customers across proteomics, across imaging, and across many different segments. We're feeling very good about what our pipeline is contributing and there is more to come there. And finally to your question on M&A, look, we've outlined the areas of growth we're interested in. And I think what you will see is that we're not just interested in entering these areas. Really meaning we are really thinking hard about what are the other key problems to solve.  So as an example, with bioprocessing, as an engineer and freshly [Indiscernible] after finishing my PhD days into my new job, I was actually doing manufacturing plant where we were still I manufacturing vaccines using chicken embryo eggs. So a fact with eggs, opening them up, and I will tell you the rest of the process. The process was designing many, many years ago, probably decades ago.  And the reason that you were -- that is -- and that's how MMR vaccines are [Indiscernible] manufacturer today, why we much better technology in some culture to be able to manufacture the same type of vaccine. And the reason for that sort of conservatism is that the process and the products are indistinguishable in the drug master file that you filed of to Biologics. And that's something that we really want to work on. We believe that our collaboration with the University of Delaware will help us make strides in that direction.  And I'm super excited about what we've just announced with Sartorius. I mean Sartorius is a leader in bioprocessing and they have probably the deepest penetration of small early-stage bioreactors that are used for clone selection. And that collaboration has two benefits. One we're able to take the BioAccord and improve a process that takes about six weeks to down to two days. And that's been shown by -- in collaboration with Sartorius scientists and our scientists, as well as customers, so very excited about that.  There are several 100 Amber [Indiscernible] area where we would have not otherwise entered. I mean, in this case, we want to enter with the capabilities that people feel extremely good about the initiatives. So in summary, continuing the commercial momentum, second, recharging innovation, and third, looking to enter these faster growth areas through partnerships, and increasing the open to M&A, if it makes sense. But I remind you that for M&A, we are a financially disciplined Company, so you won't see us jumping in [Indiscernible] into something that [Indiscernible] China year-to-date is over 30% growth. Only second to India in organic growth. From a demand perspective, for the quarter we were up mid-teens. And unfortunately, the shipment got stuck in the last few days of the quarter, which made it to our customers now. And if you included that into the Q3 numbers, it will be high single-digits to low-teens for China growth. So really, nothing to flat from a China perspective. In fact, I would say very happy with our new leader in China who's been implementing initiatives really really well, Arc HPLC has great traction.  We have built really strong commercial momentum even in our food and environmental markets [Indiscernible]. we are extremely good about where we are in China, so nothing is really to flag from a demand perspective. And on your question on supply chain, look, like everybody else in fact -- like everybody else, we are seeing constraints in shipping in different boards that appear sporadically, right? We don't think it's a systemic issue. It's a sporadic issue, and we're not unique in experiencing those challenges.  In fact, I was with a few colleagues from different industries last week, and virtually, everyone is experiencing sort of a little bit of unpredictable changes in supply chains. So we're not immune to that, and I think if somebody tells you that they are -- that's why we're not shipping as much. And then the other two pieces are of the supply chain s that are being talked a lot are are inflation; we do see inflation specifically in U.S. labor.  But nothing we haven't been able to offset by price increases with our customers. So hopefully that gives you enough color on how we feel to China. Really nothing to flag, no problem at all from a demand perspective, and from a supply chain perspective. Feeling what everybody else feels, really happy with the way our teams are working through some of these issues and starting on prices where it makes sense to our customers. And then Tycho, for AMG, I mean, we do year-to-date growing up 36%. And if you look at the consumables revenue, that's tracking nicely. So there's activity across our customers. So tracking in double-digits, so the recurring revenues are still growing double-digit with other end-market. So nothing to point out systemically overall, if you look at the market. Now, the performance is a bit different by region.  Europe is doing extremely well. But as China and the U.S. are bit slower, and that has to do with [Indiscernible] One, I do have pointed out, academic endowment is a small portion of our business and historically has not been a huge focus for Waters. We have, with John 's arrival, we had started to increase our focus on that segment, as well. And if you think about the instruments part of the business, that really depends on the [Indiscernible] relationships and customer relationships.  And this over time -- and pharma slowed down in many markets. And in Europe, we've come out of the gates very well. We've started to reestablish those relationships and you'll see the impact on the results year-to-date. In U.S. and China, that's work in progress and we'll give you updates as we go along. I'm optimistic with the activity I see, especially on the e-commerce and in procurement. And you see the results in our consumables business. And on the instruments side, we're improving [Indiscernible] relationships. I expect that to return, as well. First Vijay, good morning, and similar to what I just said to Tycho, really nothing to be concerned about from a demand perspective in China, that the $12 million have made it to the customers. And it is a bit spread, that it's -- what it's basically all instruments. It's not any consumables, so it's all instruments and it's made it to the customers. A bit spread across the different customer segments online, industrial, as well as academic and government.  So nothing one segment, feeling more pain. And in terms of how we're dealing with these issues, look and, have a superb supply chain department. We have extreme transparency on the shipments and the timing of the shipments. And we started to build inventory where we see order spikes in the different regions. And so we feel that we should be able to manage through the volatility that you are seeing in different [Indiscernible]. Morning, Jack. Look, nothing that we have visibility on that will go from Q4 to Q1. As I said, there is increased inventory in the different regions where we are seeing the demand going extremely, extremely well. And from an overall perspective, the $12 million was shipped rather promptly in Q4, right? It's just unfortunate that hinge on the days of Doug and the shipping throughout that Doug do it at the end of the quarter.  So I don't see anything that gives us visibility at this point that would tell us that they would be an impact in Q4. And in terms of what is within our hands or you heard me talk about earlier, the extreme transparency that we have on supply chain, the processes that are much, much improved over the last year, and then finally, the increased inventory is a different reason. So feel reasonably comfortable that we should be able to manage a rather ambitious end of the year. Patrick, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, I was learning baseball, like if using a baseball analogy and people have talked sense into me to start talking in revenue numbers. So that's why we put that slide together to slide 6. Brad remarks. Look [Indiscernible] off what save 1% to 1.5% extra [Indiscernible] on a stack basis. Due to the initiatives and the initiatives we're not just the instruments that basement. We saw solid attachment increase of aftermarket. We saw e-commerce adoption growth from 20-27-28%. Contact of [Indiscernible] grew, which was a new channel for us, grew roughly 40% on a two-year basis. And new product contribution also did extreme good.  So across-the-board 1% to 1.5%, sort of benefits, or what I would say the base growth and robust end markets. Next year, we think that's roughly 1% versus a base market growth of whatever the base market goes with lease. So for instrument replacement, this year, we had roughly 30 million or so of benefit. Next year to be $40 million, which is 10 million incremental, right. So that's how I would think about it, right.  So for service, 200 basis points, another 100 basis points on top. So the 200 basis points already benefits us next year. And then e-commerce goes, and anything we can read the charts. So I think that for me is how I would think about 2022 and beyond, right? And as you think about what's happening beyond, this is now part of our CRM system.  This is part of our execution that John Pratt and Jianqing are implementing, right. So we now have the full list of HPLC, UPLC, as well as the Tandem-quads in the CRM system that our reps are going through step-by-step and replacing. And this will continue next year, and will go on into the year after. Same thing is true for our service attachment rates. We know where the attachment rates are.  We're using that database to now go after it. So it has become part of the DNA of the organization, and I think that gives me confidence that we will be able to accelerate also next year. And then finally, new products, as I mentioned are doing very well. MRT has just started to pick up a lot of interest, we've talked about Arc HPLC and Premier doing very well. So we feel really good about that 1% incremental over what would be any sort of market growth. I mean, across all end markets, right? I mean, you look at pharma and all you'd look at Industrial. Industrial, it's roughly 6% to 6.5% stack growth, right? Historically, that's been 4% to 5%. So we're [Indiscernible] even bigger acceleration, relatively speaking in Industrial versus you seeing [Indiscernible] pharma. And I must say, we're seeing extremely, extremely good performance out of the TA business.  So it's nice performance across the different customer segments, be it in advance materials, be it batteries, where we test studies for renewable batteries. And I don't need to tell you why that's important these days. Electronics that's going in the high teens, double-digits, the Life Science part of our TA business is also growing nicely. So in TA, we're seeing really, really good momentum, and again on a stack basis, even outpacing the overall business of the 8% or so growth.  So I think industrial, we feel that our customers have found a way to work despite the pandemic. Our service engineers and our sales teams have access to many of these customers, initially virtually, but in many regions, increasingly also, physically, our service engineers both across Waters and TA are actually more welcome at our customer side. And many of our -- many of their own employees. So industrial is -- has picked up nice, strengthened. It's true across all geographies. China is doing well. U.S., Europe, the rest of Asia also doing really quite well. That's the real area of strength, and we're lucky to have a business like TA that's pointed in that direction. Actually, overall -- and again, I talked more in terms of stack growth, the estimated growth for the year is roughly 30% and mass SPAC doing extremely well as even higher than 30% mass spect psyche Shiloh's 30%. So nothing that you will between the two sort of product platforms. But I think it makes more sense to talk about it on a stack basis. And historically, Waters have seen instrument growth between 3% and 4%. We've sort of steadily now year-to-date stack fuel is steadily on 5%.  So really nice momentum. And this is through both of course, as well as mass specs and nothing really can sort of differentiate the two. Now, you asked about mass spec in particular. In mass spec, the demand is driven by across all our portfolios for us, I mean, across users in IVAS mass spec across our Tandem-quads, which are both used -- with the single quarter used for intact masks and also our Tandem-quads that are used in development, as well as food and environmental.  And then of course, as I mentioned, the bioprocessing yields momentum and a lot of interest in the bioprocessing arena. So mass spec is going from strength to strength. Coming to the second part of your question on new products, as I pointed out on the -- in the prepared remarks right on -- just focusing on HPLC for a minute.  Arc HPLC, as well as the premier technology, which includes columns, as well as the application of this unique technology to our instruments as that to roughly $45 million in sales in 2021, we expect that to go up to $60 plus million, sort of $15 million or so incremental. That's in the anticipate on March SPAC. New applications from BioAccord, I already mentioned that in the prepared remarks.  And the MRT has a lot of interest from many of our customers, especially ones who want to use it in the proteomics space and for imaging with our DESI technology, which can be used under ambient conditions which is quite unique. Again, new products, what is that? How HQ, introducing game-changing new products. I think what we're doing differently is just making sure that there is a lot of collection once we launch these products. And they're not just [Indiscernible]. Look, the instrument growth is driven by strong, robust end markets at our commercial execution. Again, it's our initiatives, the age replacement via your products and your question is, what is increased applications. And I would break it into two parts. One, we had indeed seen increased application of our technology in oligonucleotide mRNA. So claims to sign that somebody from the leading mRNA companies, Cambridge recently and they basically said, look, huge aggregation problems with plasmics with us, help them solve these problems by using Premier and to [Indiscernible] by using LC-MS to elucidate the [Indiscernible] of the molecules themselves.  So good application there. And a lot of them being in development, in discovery. And hopefully increasingly in QA/QC. Second area that I would comment on is the wider application of the BioAccord if you'll recall, product was initially launched, really focused on LC-MS, which we still \u2013 in QA/QC, we still believe that LC-MS has a strong place in QA/QC provided, the instrument that you have is simple, robust, and fast, and give you faster results.  But, that same value proposition is equally relevant in early stage development of complex Biologics. And we're seeing really good application there. We demonstrated with Sartorius that some experiments that take 6 weeks can now be turned around within two days. And this has been replicated in Sartorius ' labs, our labs and in several customer labs. As you can imagine, there's a ton of excitement on that front. And the BioAccord is rather unique here, the results are fast. It's a simple-to-use instrument, even somebody like me can use it.  And it provides you a wide range of results, not just on cell-culture media applications, where it is much wider than any sort of application used today, but also on the drug substance. So seeing wider application of our technologies, I'm really excited about where LC-MS is going -- especially the BioAccord with its simplicity and robustness, [Indiscernible] early stage development of [Indiscernible]. The second question, on a year-to-date instrument growth is roughly 30%, quite good about that -- I don't know [Indiscernible] In Q3, we saw nice growth, double-digit again on instruments with [Indiscernible] comps in Q3 for last year already. So double-digit growth across the 2 pieces of -- 2 lines of instruments as we [Indiscernible]. As I mentioned earlier, on a year-to-date basis and the quarter is the same, LC grew an excess of 30% mass spec in the mid 20s.  So really nothing to choose between the 2 instrument backlogs, makes less sense to look at it quarter-by-quarter, given the instrument trajectory. But again, nothing to choose between the two field, that both LC and Mass Spec have significant momentum in Q3 and year-to-date. So, and also going into Q4, we're really feeling very good about where we are. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I think on the instrument side, we really feel that we're on a very, very good track. I mean, if you just look at historical averages, right, I mean, 2020 can confound they've given all the multiple impact on a stack basis. So mostly nicely in excess of 5%, close to 6% in some cases, for our instrument business, and historically that average for Waters and across the industries between 4%.  So really nicely year of the historical averages. And in terms of how much have they floored back, when you think that -- just looking at three sort of data points, one, comparing our stacks growth rates, move instrument and consumables with the rest of the industry where they were comparable products, we feel very good that we are operating well in -- well ahead of the market, that's market plus performance on -- that's the first data point that makes us fee that we're clawing back rather nicely.  Second, we have the loss ratio that we measure internally. Those have been tracking ahead of historical averages for the last 4 quarters. And finally, there are public reports that are available which are either lot of idiosyncratic because they change the definitions [Indiscernible] also are doing pretty well as on our market share.  So we [Indiscernible] very good about how we're reversing rates [Indiscernible] our footage?. And we are a work in progress, there's a lot more to do, a lot more opportunity as well. A lot of applications for our instruments, a lot of -- lot more penetration to be [Indiscernible] but we're really good so far, better that we had. Thank you very much for your participation and questions and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our fourth quarter 2021 call, which is going to be on February 1st, 2021. Thank you."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $659 million in the Third Quarter, an increase of 11% in constant currency. Reported sales growth was also 11%. Looking at product line growth, our recurring revenue, which represents the combination of chemistry and service revenue, increased by 11% for the quarter. While instrument sales increased 10%. [Indiscernible] revenues were up 13% and service revenues were up 10%.  As we noted in our last earnings call, that recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, that are 6 fewer days in fourth quarter of this year compared to 2020. Now, I would like to comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior-year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9% compared to 55.8% in the third quarter of 2020. Improvement was driven primarily by one leverage and revenues. Acquired exchange benefit in the quarter was about 1%. More inbound to P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 17% on a constant-currency basis and on a reported basis.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs due to the normalization of prior-year cost actions, as well as higher variable compensation on the higher sales volume. In the quarter on our effective operating tax rate was 11.7%, a decrease from last year due to some inevitable or specific discrete items. Excluding the impact of these discrete items, our year-to-date tax rate is consistent with the prior year.  Our average share count coming in at 61.9 million shares or about 400 thousand less than the third quarter of last year. As a result of our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased 23% to $2.66 in comparison to $2.16 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully-diluted share increased to $2.60, compared to $2.03 last year.  A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in the press release issued this morning and the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and exclude special items. In the third quarter of 2021, free cash flow was $140 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures.  Excluded from the free cash flow was $12 million, relating to investment in our content precision chemistry operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow has increased to [Indiscernible] million and approximately $0.25 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. In the third quarter, accounts receivable DSO, came in at 71 days, down 5 days compared to the third quarter of last year. And down 2 days compared to the last quarter [Indiscernible] DIO decreased by 13 days compared to the third quarter of last year. Given the higher sales volume our proactive measures to secure a supply in monthly increased by $62 million in comparison to the prior year.  We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 369,000 shares of our common stock for 151 million in Q3. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was 958 million, with net debt to EBITDA ratio about one. Our capital deployment priority [Indiscernible] to invest in growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, return capital to shareholders, and to deploy capital to well thought out, attractive and adjacent growth opportunities.  As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you with some update on our parts for 2021 on slide 11. Throughout this year, we've seen good momentum driven by robust, end-market demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue and expect our near-term growth initiatives to continue to contribute meaningfully to our performance. Looking at the fourth quarter, the comparison is more challenging.  As it was the first quarter in our transformation journey, and was further favorably impacted by forced lockdown, elevated year-end budget plus spending. In addition, we have six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. These dynamics supports updated full-year 2021 guidance and 15% to 16% constant currency sales growth. At current exchange rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1% decline, resulting in full-year reported sales growth guidance of 16% to 17%.  Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% to 59%, and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29% to 30%. We expect our full-year net interest expense to be $34 million, and full-year net rate to be 14% to 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately $62 million. Our share [Indiscernible] purchase program will also continue into Q4 and will provide quarterly updates as appropriate [Indiscernible] August together on a non-GAAP basis [Indiscernible] 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $10.94 to $11.04.  This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 2% points at today's rate and assumes no material at worse supply impact from COVID. Looking at the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 5% to 7%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2% decline, resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales look guidance of 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings for fully diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3% points at today's rate. And assumes no material had worse supply impact from COVID. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for summary comments. Udit? So we tell you -- we do expect our gross margins in Q4 to be about 58% to 59%, right? And we've seen so far in Q3, as we said, 1% tailwind onto cross margin. Looking ahead, I mean, the dollar has strengthened and we do have -- most currencies we are operationally has to accept bound and that's the currency where we are exposed. But other than that, we've sort of included that in our guide, and that's where you see BDO close to $0.10 headwind on EPS versus the last earnings call in our Q4 EPS guidance. Yeah, look, U.S. labor continues to be a place where we're seeing inflationary pressures, right? I think with a strong HR function, we've put a lot of measures in place to reduce attrition and sustained talent, right? However, that doesn't play out so much in terms of cost and operating expenses into Q4. What -- as you model Q4, what you have to keep in mind is Q4 is a heavy revenue partner for us. And that results in commission payment accrued heavily in Q4, which is why it's typically seen as historically operating expenses especially as G&A on every other Q4. And that's reflected in archives. Yeah. So on the two questions, the first one, there's no one-time activity in R&D or SG&A. So it's pretty straightforward. On the 12 million shipment that got delayed and I mean, you could assume it's largely instruments and modeling that instrument in gross margin."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Lynch, Waters' Vice President and Corporate Treasurer. This is Amol's first conference call as Waters' CFO. Welcome, Amol.\nAmol Chaubal: Thanks, Udit.\nUdit Batra: I would like to start the call on Slide 3 by paying our respects to the founder of our company, Jim Waters, who passed away on May 17. Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. I met Jim the first time in 2019, when he came to talk to me about the merits of a technology we had acquired in a previous company. We spent hours in front of a whiteboard debating how to manage innovation and in particular how the application of certain technology could deliver benefit. Jim continued reaching out to me, not just on technology, but also on our mutual love for science education and then more recently on Waters. Jim's legacy will live on with each and every one of our innovations as we continue to strive to deliver benefits. Our teams around the globe have continued to manage admittedly through the pandemic, which is still very much with us. Most of all, we've kept the working environment safer employees and have remained flexible and resourceful as we continue to support our customers. I remain grateful for the ongoing resilience, commitment and dedication that our team has shown. Moving on to Slide 4, during today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. I will also update you on the progress of our transformation plan. We continue to be focused on three primary objectives: number one, regaining our commercial momentum, number two, further strengthening our organization, and number three, building on a core \u2013 on a strong core to access even higher growth areas. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated third quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies. Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis. This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again on a constant currency basis. Our strong top-line growth resulted in a year on \u2013 year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share. Our top and bottom line performance translated into solid free cash flow performance and allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. Looking more closely at our top-line results in the quarter on Slide 6, first by operating segment, our Waters' division grew 27% while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis. By end market, our largest market category pharma grew 31% in constant currency, industrial grew 28% and academia and government grew 7%. A continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications. Late stage drug development activity drove sales of our tandem quad MS instrument systems such as the Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S micro, small molecule applications in manufacturing QA and QC grew across Asia, Europe and North America and was particularly strong in India. Industrial end market growth was also broad-based across geographies and applications, continuing its recovery so far this year. Food testing and environmental demand grew nicely in the quarter as did our thermal and geometry portfolios. Turning into academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business. Growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China. Year-to-date, our primary geographies have all returned to growth versus last year. Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis. Sales in Asia grew 28% with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%, sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26% and sales in Europe grew 25%. In the U.S. all end markets had strong year-over-year performance led by pharma and industrial. Academic and governments saw a return to growth for the quarter as the market continues to recover. Europe's growth was also broad-based across end markets and sub-regions. Overall, pharma drove growth with strong demand with small molecule and large molecule applications. Industrial and academic and government markets continued their recovery with both having strong quarters and strong starts to the first half of the year. China sales were up sharply in our pharma business, and we had solid growth in our industrial and applied end market there as well. We're encouraged by our continued strength in the contract labs business due to strong execution of our growth initiatives. In India, sales for the quarter were again very strong even as the country continued to feel the effects from the pandemic. We're really grateful for the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, who persevered through these challenging and tragic conditions. Trends in Q2 and year-to-date for our LC instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for sustainable growth in consumables and service plans. In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies at more than 40% growth driven by our instrument replacement initiative and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our PREMIER instruments both Arc and ACQUITY lines. This week, I spent time with customers at our Immerse innovation lab in Cambridge, discussing the separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules. While mRNA vaccines have developed at a record pace, we are far from solving key issues such as aggregation and selective binding of plasmids and mRNA molecules to various surfaces, something that our PREMIER technology addresses really well. Further strengthening our UPLC portfolio, the Arc system was launched earlier this year for customers, who need ultimate sensitivity. The Arc PREMIER delivers fivefold improvement in detector sensitivity and tenfold improvement in asset to asset precision helping labs accelerate time to market. Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30% driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications. This included high-resolution systems used for research applications such as the Xevo QTof, tandem quad led by our Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S Microsystems and our SQD and QDa single quad detectors utilized in high-performance LCMs applications. We introduced the Waters' SELECT SERIES MRT, a high resolution mass spectrometer that combines Multi Reflecting Time-of-Flight, MRT technology with both enhanced DESI and new MALDI imaging sources. The MRT provides scientists with a unique combination of speed, resolution and mass accuracy, especially relevant for applications in proteomics. We have been in conversations with customers to see how we can collaborate using MRT to analyze libraries of samples to create a database of proteins and metabolites to further understand the impact of therapeutics on a variety of issues. Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28% driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand. Demand for our premier columns continues to be strong. The low double-digit two years stack growth of chemistry columns revenue in Q2 when compared to our 2019 base underscores the rebound and customer activity, the strong position of our portfolio and building momentum of our e-commerce initiative. Service also showed strong double-digit growth. Our service engineers continue to have good and improved access to our customer sites and I'm grateful for the way they have served customers while continuing to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. Finally, with respect to TA demand continues to rebound and was balanced across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe. Let me now give you some highlights on our progress with implementation of our transformation plan on Slide 7. Starting that our first priorities are gaining our commercial momentum. We continue to see progress in our instrument replacement initiative, a released Arc HPLC has played an important role in the LC replacement initiative. It's improved mechanical specs and ability to seamlessly transfer methods from alliance HPLC or other HPLC platforms have been very well received by our customers. We're already crossing the mid-single digit stack growth versus 2019 on a year-to-date basis in LC. With our CRO and CDMO customers, our ability to develop and provide method transfer support continues to be a strong driver of growth. This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019. Early trends that we saw in China has now been replicated in Europe, as well as in the U.S. Our e-commerce and recurring revenue attachment initiatives are also starting to boost the momentum of drug in our year-to-date two years stacked CAGR for chemistry and service revenue. Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8. We have strengthened our organization with the addition of wage to our Board of Directors. They currently serve as President of their pharmaceuticals for China and APAC. As results driven experience will further \u2013 they further expand the perspective of the Board that directly aligns with what are the strategy to accelerate growth and innovation. I'm also pleased to welcome Dr. Daniel Rush to Water as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Transformation. Dan joins us from Bristol-Myers, where he was VP of Worldwide Commercialization Strategy and Innovation. Dan joined several of our technically trained executive committee members that experience in orchestrating transformations in M&A, in relevant to customer segments like pharma and diagnostics. This things need to our third priority of building our core to drive durable growth. As you will see on Slide 9, Waters' already has a strong foundation in large and going at markets with a leading position of science and innovation and a roughly $65 billion market. A high exposure \u2013 high exposure to end markets that go around mix single digits that has deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA-QC. A large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic race with over 40% \u2013 almost 40% sales in Asia and industry leading margins are the strong financial flexibility. So you'll agree with me that this is a solid base to build off? Now I'm on Slide 10. To build a team of leaders who have a strong track record of execution, both Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett, Heads of the Waters division, and the TA division respectively are highly experienced commercial leaders and are now very focused on building capabilities to sustain our commercial momentum. What gives me most pleasure is that we have started to hit our stride with new product introductions across the portfolio. And these are contributing to our sales momentum, already. Leadership that is focused on execution and innovation is preparing us well to further build our portfolio to access even faster, growing adjacencies. They are exploring and nurturing opportunities, both organic and inorganic to increase our exposure to biologics, be it bio-processing reagents are novel modalities. They are actively shaping the promise of LCMs and diagnostics and proteomics discovery applications and advancing lab connectivity applications to our informatics portfolio. High growth areas such as sustainable polymers and renewable energy are a focus of the TA division. In summary, we've had a strong start to the year with a broad base \u2013 with broad based contributions from our end markets, product portfolio and geographies to our revenue growth. In addition to the impressive growth versus our 2020 base of comparison, our business dynamics and customer demand look healthy on a two-year runway basis. Markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions are re-bonding solidly from pandemic lows. We remain focused on the continued progress and success of our short-term initiatives in that tactically strengthening our core business. We're confident in the opportunities ahead to bring LCMS products, separations expertise, and compliant data management experience into high-growth biopharma and diagnostic applications. I look forward to continuing to share more with you as we progress on these various fronts. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the second quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outline, we recorded next sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%. Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%. Chemistry revenues went up 28%, and servicing revenues were up 13%. As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of days for the third quarter either. However, please note there are six fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year, compared to 2020. Now, I would like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Before I do so, a reminder that in the second quarter of 2020 we took decisive actions to manage our costs as part of our near-term cost savings plan in light of the pandemic, while our COVID cost savings plan was successful, totaling approximately $100 million for 2020; it does have some implications in not year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points, despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020. This improvement was driven by volume leverage and productivity gains. Moving down to P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis, and 42% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and variable compensation, the majority of which relates to normalization of the prior year cost actions. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period including some unfavorable discrete items. Our average share count came in at 60.2 million shares, approximately flat versus a second quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares increased to $2.69 come back to $1.98 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and exclude's special items. In the second quarter of 2021 free cash flow declined 12% year-over-year to $155 million after funding $37 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation, a $38 million tax reform payment, and 3 million litigation's settlement receipt. In the second quarter this resulted in $0.23 of each $1 of sales converted into free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow has increased 17%, to $348 million. In the second quarter accounts receivable DSO came in at 73 days, down 14 days compared to the second quarter of last year. Inventories increased slightly by 5 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of our common stock for $168 million in the second quarter. At the end of second quarter, our net debt position was $940 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. In addition, we will evaluate deploying capital to well taught out attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you some update on our parts for 2021 on Slide 11. In the first half of the year, we saw good momentum in our market segments, driven by robust demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue in the second half of the year, but the comparisons are more challenging. Fourth quarter of 2020 was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by higher year end budget plus spending. In addition, we have six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also keeping a watchful eye on the potential impact of newer COVID variance and the likely disruption they may cause to both supply and demand. We expect our near-term growth initiatives and commercial momentum to contribute meaningfully to our performance. These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth. At current rates the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 to 2 percentage points resulting in a full-year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $37 million and full year tax rate to be 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately 62 million. Throughout the year we'll evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all of these together and on a non-GAAP basis full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range $10.50 to $10.70. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID. Looking at the third quarter of 2021 we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%. At today's rates currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point resulting in third-quarter reporting sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage point at today's rates and also assumes no worst demand or supplying back from COVID. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. In summary, there is much to be pleased about the first half of the year driven by strong growth across our major end markets. Thanks to solid execution and double-digit growth in instrument sales we saw broad-based revenue growth across every region. Our transformation plan continues to progress the commercial momentum and strong leadership team in place. We now turn towards deploying our strategy in large and growing end markets. We operate through accelerating innovation to our portfolio as well as progressively aligning our portfolio with higher growth areas in adjacent markets. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan and your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hi, good morning. Nice quarter. Udit, I want to start with the replacement cycle. I know you talked about the Arc HPLC driving replacements on that side. I'm just wondering if you could share your latest thinking on how you're sizing that opportunity. I know last quarter you opened it up to competitive instruments. So if you could talk about the LC and MS side in terms of where we are in that replacement cycle and latest thinking on the size of that opportunity. That would be great.\nUdit Batra: So, thank you, Tycho, for the question. Look the LC placement cycle, last time I said we are in the third innings using a baseball analogy. I would say we're now in the seventh inning or so in terms of having tracked down all customers that are relevant for replacement, especially our own and to some extent our competitors. I would say we have reached out to almost 80% of our own customers and 20% to 30% of the competitive replacements, both across LC as well as mass spec. And we've recently, as I told you, added that UPLC segment to it as well. So really we start with the customers really solid, solid feedback, and especially with the introduction of Arc HPLC last year and now the promise of the Arc PREMIER, as well as the ACQUITY premier columns, which are really relevant for high-end separations. We're having very good luck with and very good performance with our LC replacement initiative. So from an overall contribution perspective, I would say we should think about it in terms of the stacked growth. So if you just look at our first half of the year, our organic constant currency stacked growth versus 2019 is roughly 7%. And if you compare it to our peer group over the same period on a stacked basis, and we've seen numbers anywhere ranging from about 2.5% to 3% to closer to 5-ish percent. So that if you take a weighted average gives you a lead of let's say 2% to 3% versus the roughly defined market. And I would say part of it is explained by our initiatives and part of it is explained \u2013 there's 2% to 3% lead versus the market, part of it is explained by outperformance of our initiatives and the LC replacement initiative being a strong contributor to it and part of it is replaced by really a strong uptake of our new products. I hope that gives you a bit of color and some quantification, and the best way to compare it is to just look at the stacked growth versus the overall market. And we are now trending, I think, probably second or third quarter in a row of our market plus organic performance.\nTycho Peterson: Yes, that's very helpful. And then second question on that with the guidance increase, I am just wondering across kind of the three key end markets, pharma, industrial and academic, how you're thinking about transaction in the quarter sustainability as a moment you are seeing into the back of the year. Can you just provide some updated thoughts across each of those three groups?\nUdit Batra: Sure. So again, just first the facts, Tycho. For the second half of the year, stack growth would lead us to between slightly \u2013 north of 5% to slightly north of 6%, right. So that's, I mean, a year ago who would have thought that we would be here already. So, I mean, we're very happy with the ability to provide such a guidance. Across the three end markets, pharma goes from strength to strength and our strong presence in pharma benefits us as you can see disproportionately, so we expect that to continue. And on industrial, as you know, it can be quite a lumpy market, but if you again look at the fact growth of industrial, we are slightly higher than our overall average, which is closer to 5%, so we're closer to 6% on a stock basis for industrial growth on a year-to-date basis. So that again bodes well, I mean, again if you look at it over a longer period of time, it bodes well for what we're seeing on the industrial side, barring any sort of cyclicality due to the pandemic reemerging strongly. We think that trend should continue for the balance of the year. And then finally, academic and government, which is our smallest segment has backed quite an important one to place, especially our mass spec instruments, for the first half of the year was roughly on a stack base was roughly around 17% growth versus last year. And we expect that trend to start emerging even more strongly in the second half of the year. So we feel reasonably good across all three markets. I mean in the simplest way despite the pandemic, most of our customers and our teams have figured out how to work through the difficulties. I mean that's \u2013 there's not 100% access everywhere, but I feel they figured out a way to work through the ups and downs of the pandemic. I hope that gives you some color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Congrats on a good print this morning and thanks for taking my question. Udit and Amol maybe one on the Q in this guidance. If you at instruments, Udit, 40% growth. That is an impressive number and no doubt. But sequentially, we're just at 45% in Q1 perhaps a slight decal and I look at the segments, maybe academia a little bit soft. So I'm curious on the trends driving your instrument performance in the Q and what's implied in the back half? And Amol, on the back half, you mentioned six fewer selling days for Q4, can you quantify what the impact is?\nUdit Batra: Well, let me start with the instrument piece and then I'll pass over to Amol for the second part of the question. Under instrument piece, Vijay, I mean, we are really, really pleased with what we're seeing from \u2013 for three reasons. Number one, our initiatives are working extremely well, I mean, having a 40% to 45% growth versus last year, and then more impressively trending above our long-term average and we're already at mid single digits on instrument growth on a stack basis bodes very well. Second, it's equally important as you look at the recurring revenues and the impact on the recurring revenues, and you start to see some of that impact on the recurring revenues for the first half of the year already, the more \u2013 the larger the instrument placement, the larger the recurring revenues. And then finally, the third piece is around innovation. I mean our innovation across and this is probably the most enduring aspect of the transformation now. Our innovation is starting to hit its strides across the portfolio, right? You've talked \u2013 you asked about the instruments, so let me focus on that. We introduced Arc HPLC last year and I've talked several times about its benefit in China and the rest of the world for the workhorse \u2013 HPLC segment, we launched the Arc and the ACQUITY PREMIERE, which are also doing extremely well. In fact, ironically, the launch of ACQUITY PREMIERE has led to even increased demand for I-Class and H-Class \u2013 H-Class portfolio, which is meant for separating biologics and looking at high-end separations. So the portfolio across LC is really, really revitalized. And then on the mass spec side, having introduced new platforms for the tandem quads in 2019, the latest is the MRT, the multi-reflecting Tof and we have a lot of interest from our customers on that front. It's early days on where the sales will land on that. As you know, these are big ticket items, and they're also dependent upon capital outlays, but I feel very good about where we stand with our instrument initiative, the instrument replacement initiative, but even more importantly, how innovation is helping us to stay in that placement. Going forward, I mean, Jon Pratt and [indiscernible] thing will integrate this instrument replacement approach into our commercial execution. So this would not be new starting \u2013 starting late this year or early next year. So very happy with where we are. Amol, on the guide?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes, sure. And, Vijay, to follow on your question on six fewer days in Q4, I mean, that impacts our recurring revenue particularly service because service is accrued on a day-by-day basis for the annual contracts, as well as it impacts our chemistry revenue because of lesser utilization days in the quarter. And so at this point with six days it has roughly 3 percentage point impact in the sales realized in the quarter from six less days.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Amol. And, Udit, one follow-up. There's been some chatter about Alzheimer's is being a new opportunity for the entire life science tool space, but particularly for you guys in LT, historically, it hasn't been an instrument that's known for biologic area. Is there something different about this opportunity on the Alzheimer's side? That makes it different. Is this a meaningful opportunity for you guys? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: So, Vijay, we're very happy that there are additional therapies, so Alzheimer's coming out to the market and that was great news for patients. Look, it's very early to quantify and start thinking about exactly the impact of this therapy on our business. And it's suffice it to say we are well specked in most of the compounds that are in the late stages, especially in the QA-QC domain of large and small molecules. So, that's where I'll \u2013 that's as much as I will comment on it. I think it's too early to comment on the specifics and the quantification of such an opportunity.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hi, good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So, clearly, The Street is giving Waters a lot of credit for the solid progress made over the past few quarters under your leadership, Udit, and I know you wouldn't take full credit. It's you and the team by one way or the other. You're doing a great job and the stock reflects that. That said, it's still hard from the outside to tell how much of this is favorable multi-year comparisons versus better execution keeping in mind that the company really struggled for a few years relative to peers heading into the pandemic. It's obviously a bit of both and you tried to help to cut through this by providing stacked growth figures relative to 2019. But again, even that's noisy given how the company was performing heading into the pandemic? So cutting through all of that, what arguably matters most is how we should think about the future outlook for Waters' growth at the top line? Your stacked analysis that you talked about in your prepared remarks pointed to 6% to 7% growth at the top-line. As we sit here today, based on the progress you've made and just cutting through the comps, are you comfortable asserting that Waters has built to compound revenue growth annually at 6% to 7% moving forward?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Doug. I can't help, but laugh about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question, I just \u2013 it's a long \u2013 it's a serious progress in a year. But to answer your question legitimately, I would say it has to \u2013 if you look at the long-term growth, I won't give you a number. I think it's very difficult to do it. What you can safely assume is our ambition is to remain a top-tier performer, especially when you look at the organic growth, right. So we've now for the last two or three quarters on a stacked basis have been market plus and our margins remain at the high-end of the industry. So that's our ambitions, right. So, I mean, that's what I'll tell you. Is it 4%, 5%, 6%? I don't know, but if it's 4%, we have the ambition to be higher than 4%, if it's 5%, it's higher, and you can go on from there. But there are two drivers that make me confident, actually three drivers that make me confident that we can be at the higher-end of the market. Number one, we've put a very solid team together with experienced leaders, who have shown in the past that they can execute very well above market \u2013 on the above market growth and they have experience in of course conducting transformations and integrations. So I feel very good about the team we've put together. Second, we're starting to develop a rhythm in our execution and you end up seeing the results, but we see a lot of leading indicators. And I've tried to give you some color around the different initiatives. And these are initiatives should \u2013 that should help us in longer-term. The LC replacement initiative has changed the way we work at Waters or probably brought us back to where Waters started long time ago, and looking at each and every replacement initiative and diligently going after through our CRM channel. That's a long-term improvement and execution. E-commerce, last year, at the same time we were less \u2013 less than 20% of our consumables went through the e-commerce channel. Today that number is in excess of 25%, that's in less than a year. And there is a long runway ahead of us in seeing the benefit of that execution. We've started to tap into newer customer segments. And again, I mean, I was pretty open about how underweighted we were in the CRO, CDMO, food testing segments in China. And there we've just started to hit the side. And you can see on a two year stack basis that's 60% growth, on a one year stacked basis that's a 40% growth in the same channel. And we are seeing our value proposition resonate very well with our customers. Our sales teams are super excited about what we're hearing from our customers. So these \u2013 the execution platforms that we've built, and I've just gone through three of these are going to help us for many, many years to come. And the last piece is innovation, which is most endearing to me. I mean, we have really been very precise about identifying unmet needs, and this is something definitely I don't take credit for. This has been going on at Waters for a long period of time. It was just starting to rekindle it and focusing us on the right problems to solve. We've seen already the impact of the recent launches in LC, the MRC is strengthening our high-res mass spec portfolio, the PREMIERE launch for the PREMIER \u2013 the PREMIER technology for columns as \u2013 could not have come at a better timing given the need for continued separation of more complex modalities, which have a higher affinity to metal. So I feel very good that there is a team in place that has a strong execution track record both organic and inorganic execution and the pipeline is starting to hit its stride. And I think that gives me confidence that wherever the market is, we can have the ambition to be a market class. Okay, I hope that gives you color.\nDoug Schenkel: Yes, that's helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up kind of along the same lines, recognizing higher instrument mix and the impact that has margin some of your comments on FX having a negative impact on margin in the quarter. I think the incremental margin was only 21%, 22%. And I think guidance for the year implies a high 20s incremental margin on really strong top-line growth. I think two of the big questions as it relates to Waters are the longer-term growth outlook at the top-line, which is why I asked the first question. The other question continues to be where margins can go from here. Recognizing mix, recognizing FX, recognizing you're investing in long-term initiatives over time, do you think the incrementals can get into the 30s over the next few years?\nUdit Batra: Thanks. Thanks again, Doug. I'll let Amol comment on how we're thinking about margin progression in a second. But I mean you should also look at the impact of additional instrument placement on the recurring revenues. And then when I talk about innovation and sustainability, the recurring revenues on a two year stack basis are double digits, right? Especially \u2013 our two year stack basis \u2013 sorry, chemistry is double digits and recurring revenues are high single digits on a two year stack basis, on a one year stack basis it's a double digit performance. So instrument placement helps with consumables placement, which are, of course, higher margin part of the business. I'll let Amol comment on your \u2013 on the breakdown of the margin.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Now, let me look from a longer-term outlook point of view from our margin profile, as you know, we have one of the best margins within the industry. We have a very disciplined sort of margin management profile within the company. And then as you step back, there are so many opportunities in terms of margins, right. One, as Udit mentioned, there is a huge opportunity in increasing our recurring revenue attachment rates and recurring revenue is a higher margin product or between chemistry and service, and that helps expand margin. As you look into operations, I mean, there's a huge effort underway on operational excellence and our procurement programs, which are starting to deliver and that would help our margin profile. We have a similar program underway on our service productivity initiatives, and that will expand margin and then there is the whole area around capability centers, and we haven't really invested in capability centers so far, and that will bring margin expansion. Now at the same time, as Udit outlined we continue to explore and nurture really fantastic adjacent growth opportunities, and those opportunities will need some investment. So the general plan is to use this margin expansion in some way to fund some of these investment opportunities and yet to deliver part of a steady margin profile. And as these programs deliver growth, you will see margin expansion show up over time.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hello, good morning.\nUdit Batra: Good morning.\nDerik De Bruin: So a couple of questions. So the constant currency number in 2Q, it didn't include any acquisitions, I don't think. And I guess, can we talk a little bit about capital deployment and sort of like how you're thinking about balancing share buy backs with M&A opportunities. And it also, I know you're talking about investing in certain new initiatives and diagnostics in so many other areas, because as you put a little bit more clarity on where you sort of see some of the more likely near term opportunities for bolt-ons?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So thanks Derik. I think off the bat, I mean, of course we can't be specific on where the immediate M&A opportunity or the midterm M&A opportunity is for obvious reasons. But from a capital deployment perspective, I mean, we remain flexible, right? I think that's been our \u2013 that's been our approach and disciplined, right? So this is basically something that you've heard us say many, many times. Now, in terms of the specific \u2013 in terms of the specific areas where we're interested, of course, given our very strong core, I mean we want to continue to invest in our core. If there are better technologies to perform separations that are dedicated to novel modalities to biologics, I mean we are very well placed to nurture those and capture those. And that's an area that we're looking at cheaply. We're looking at augmenting our instruments with automation. We continue to chase that space rather carefully. If I move to informatics, Empower is the leader in chromatography data that we also have the concept of creating a connected lab. And there too, we look for partnerships and expanding our portfolio, that's in the core. If you look outside the core, really where we see our technology is growing and some of the attractive data that we see our technology is going of course one of them is bioprocessing where we think step decoupling the process from the product is an imperative, and we believe technologies such as LCMS and technologies such as BioAccord in particular can help us help us achieve that objective. And we're seeing very good traction on that front, especially as we seed instruments earlier and earlier with our customers. So I feel very good about that. And then secondly, in and I've talked about LCMs in particular, and I'll let Amol comment on this as he gives you this view on capital deployment as well. On LCMs in particular we feel it's a technology that belongs in diagnostics and enhancing our ability to examine proteins in addition to \u2013 in addition to being genomics into that segment. So I feel very good about what we are doing on the LSMs front its early days, but we've done some pilots. We think we can do a fair bit organically, but we also might require partnerships. So that hopefully gives you a flavor of the areas we're thinking off. Amol, did you want to comment a bit on how we are thinking about.\nAmol Chaubal: I think you've covered it well, and Derik as we outlined in our prepared remarks, right, our priority with the clear product there is growth and the team work there is well thoughtout as we look at, I guess in growth opportunities, and that's how we will look at capital deployment, right? We will pursue growth, remain flexible, but be well thought out in what we choose.\nDerik De Bruin: Okay. One follow-up if I may; what was the percentage of new products \u2013 percentage of revenues from new products? I mean, do you have a vitality index and was there any COVID either you would call out COVID related sales in prior quarters, and just curious, do you have an update on that? Thanks.\nAmol Chaubal: Sure. So we do track our product vitality index and we look at it as products on the instrument side launched in the last three years and products on the chemistry side launched in the last five years. On our product quality index was close to 12% in the second quarter. We had very little, over to be nothing in terms of COVID impact on our Q2 revenue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your lines are open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Maybe one on China, the performance there, obviously 1Q, I think you had up over 100% growth and then the very easy comp. This is around 40% this quarter, obviously still very strong. Can you just talk about what you saw there sequentially, I mean, was 1Q kind of a bit of a catch-up on the span and this quarter a little more normalized, it seems to be we are going out what's going on in space, but we'd love your take on China here?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Thanks, Patrick for the question. I'm super excited about what's happening in China. We have a new leader for the last few months, and she's been making a tremendous changes that I've lead to acceleration. In the first quarter you'll remember that, that the pandemic hit China first. So the first quarter also actually weaker than the second quarter in China until you'll see a bit of a comp effect, but fundamentally all the initiatives that we've launched at global level are on China speed in China, right? So let me explain. From a factual perspective, right, so the second quarter growth was roughly 40% versus the previous year driving that instruments, the Arc HPLC was the design for the China market, and it's done very well, especially given its better performance in any of the \u2013 any of the other instruments available in the market. Second, from a consumables perspective we've seen really good progress on in China, in \u2013 mostly in the \u2013 even in excess of the instrument growth in some cases. And then finally on the CRO, CDMO and CTO sort of initiative; remember we talked about the food market in the past and we've said we were underweight in the food market. In China we've seen very good growth there; almost doubling of the business versus the same period last year. And then sort of CRO and the CDMO piece are -- the growth that I've mentioned was a global growth meaning 60% on a full year \u2013 on a two year stack basis. This in China is \u2013 this turnaround of growth for CRO, CDMO segment started in China. So feel very good about what's happening in China. And we'll just, I would say we've just begun on looking at newer segments, like the contract testing segments, both in food and pharma. We've started to work really efficiently and effectively on our presence and placement of instruments. And I feel very good about what we're going to do on the consumer growth side as well. So I hope that gives you a bit of color on what we see in China.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And Amol, welcome to the world of LCs and mass specs from amino acids. Really great to have you on board here. So first one is a bit, it is really around the instrument replacement cycle. My main question there is you pointed to arc replacement being in the seventh inning, correct me if I'm wrong about 8,000 instruments or so. So my question is absolutely first of all, it's great to see the replacements cycle, but in terms of when we think about next year, this does create tougher compares for 2022. You are replacing your own legacy LT Alliance here. So I'm just trying to understand what are some other initiatives that you have ongoing, including acuity replacement, tandem triple quads, replacements that you've talked about before. So just should we think about this level of growth continuing into next year with further replacement cycles? Because obviously, mass spec at Tandem Quads and liquidities are \u2013 there's a, maybe a smaller install base there than the Arc one. So if you could clarify that for next year, that'd be great? Thank you\nUdit Batra: Just to first quantify a little bit, right, so we said there are about 8,000 or so alliance instruments that that required a placement at our own 4,000-ish which is half the number for UPLC Acuity, and about 1,000 Tandem Quads, right? So varying degrees of progress on all of those, they should continue for a little bit of time, while we work through our own portfolio and then turn our attention to the competitive portfolio as well. Which especially on the LC side, whatever is plugged into Empower with gold, our reps that any time there's a replacement there, we want to be \u2013 we want to be in competition, especially if it's a competitive instrument. So your question is more around what challenges it creates for the future. First, let me start with the opportunity; the opportunity is that as you have more instruments base, you start to see a better recording revenue. I think that is the first and the most important piece. The second is on the placement cycle. This will become modus operandi as soon as we brought to our own installed base, and as we moved to our competitors installed base are playbook, which has been honed over the last six months or so is now becoming standard operating procedure for our reps around the globe. So it will be \u2013 of course, I mean from a mathematical perspective the growth on the instrument side has been terrific. I mean, we think it's a benefit for our recurring revenues both service and consumables. But it's becoming our modus operandi as we go forward. So Waters will no longer be letting instruments and perhaps even competitors go off our install base.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Waldman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Previously you've talked about benefiting from customers investing in all go capabilities. I wondered if you could talk through the opportunity you see here, and I guess what is your, I guess current level of conviction that investments continue to serve as a growth catalyst for waters in the 2022 and beyond. And is it maybe just a one-time bolus that hits here in 2021?\nUdit Batra: Yes. I think Josh, it's a very good question. And last week I was at our Immerse site, Immerse Innovation site in Cambridge Mass, and had an opportunity to talk to several customers, especially ones who are now working in the mRNA space and the SiRNA space. And I would say universally, we're far from having solved the challenges for separating oligonucleotides and mRNA molecules, right. And if you just think of the progression there, number one, large number of large \u2013 very large number of compounds in the pipeline that are now leveraging the mRNA technology. And you must've seen some recent acquisitions in this space as well. But if you break the problem down from a separation standpoint, there's the plasmid, there is the mRNA molecule, and then there's also the lipid nanoparticle. For all three of these [indiscernible] we are far from having solved the aggregation problem, the problem with affinity to metal surfaces. And as I said earlier, the introduction of the premiere technology couldn't have come at a better time. So I believe given the further investment in the pipeline of molecules in this space, basically oligo-based compounds, our technological focus especially on separations of these complex molecules. First with the premier technology and others that we're working on bodes very well for what we see in the future. And I can tell you that I mean customers, while we have delivered \u2013 while the customers and us working together have delivered vaccines in record times, they're very far from having native and efficient process. So something that is a significant opportunity for Waters from an innovation standpoint, as you go forward.\nOperator: And thank you. And our last question for today comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good morning. My question is focused on gross margins. Udit, I was curious if we could start and just give us an update on the supply chain and how you're managing through any constraints you might be seeing? And then just looking at the full year guidance at 58%, it implies that the second half gross margins are below what you did in the first half. How much of this is related to the selling days, or is there some other dynamic related to investments kind of weighing on the seasonality this year?\nUdit Batra: So thanks for your question, Jack. Look from a supply chain perspective we have so far managed really rally with our suppliers and we are monitoring any dynamics in the supply chain, including ships that are stranded on the West Coast of the U.S. So we're very closely monitoring all those changes. We are in constant conversation with our suppliers so far so good. But I mean we are monitoring s things change, especially on electronic box. Let me also we're to Amol, to talk about the gross margin.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So on the gross margin, right, I mean, usually, typically in the March month, we take merit increases up. But that merit increase doesn't travel into the P&L because the inventory turns right on the gross margin side. And if you assume sort of a 3% merit increase, that will only travel into the P&L second half of the year with the inventory turns. So that sort of explains why gross margin is lower in the second half versus the first time.\nJack Meehan: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. That concludes today's conference. I'll go ahead and turn it back over to the speakers at this time.\nUdit Batra: Thank you all for your participation and questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our third quarter of 2021 call, which we currently anticipate holding on November 2, 2021. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. You may disconnect your lines and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning everyone. Along with Caspar joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and John Lynch, Waters' Vice President and Corporate Treasurer. This is Amol's first conference call as Waters' CFO. Welcome, Amol. I would like to start the call on Slide 3 by paying our respects to the founder of our company, Jim Waters, who passed away on May 17. Jim was a brilliant and spirited scientist and a pioneer in liquid chromatography. I met Jim the first time in 2019, when he came to talk to me about the merits of a technology we had acquired in a previous company. We spent hours in front of a whiteboard debating how to manage innovation and in particular how the application of certain technology could deliver benefit. Jim continued reaching out to me, not just on technology, but also on our mutual love for science education and then more recently on Waters. Jim's legacy will live on with each and every one of our innovations as we continue to strive to deliver benefits. Our teams around the globe have continued to manage admittedly through the pandemic, which is still very much with us. Most of all, we've kept the working environment safer employees and have remained flexible and resourceful as we continue to support our customers. I remain grateful for the ongoing resilience, commitment and dedication that our team has shown. Moving on to Slide 4, during today's call, I will provide a brief overview of our second quarter operating results as well as some commentary on our end markets, geographies and technologies. I will also update you on the progress of our transformation plan. We continue to be focused on three primary objectives: number one, regaining our commercial momentum, number two, further strengthening our organization, and number three, building on a core \u2013 on a strong core to access even higher growth areas. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated third quarter and full year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies. Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis. This translates to a 7% stacked CAGR versus 2019 for the first half of the year, again on a constant currency basis. Our strong top-line growth resulted in a year on \u2013 year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share. Our top and bottom line performance translated into solid free cash flow performance and allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. Looking more closely at our top-line results in the quarter on Slide 6, first by operating segment, our Waters' division grew 27% while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis. By end market, our largest market category pharma grew 31% in constant currency, industrial grew 28% and academia and government grew 7%. A continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications. Late stage drug development activity drove sales of our tandem quad MS instrument systems such as the Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S micro, small molecule applications in manufacturing QA and QC grew across Asia, Europe and North America and was particularly strong in India. Industrial end market growth was also broad-based across geographies and applications, continuing its recovery so far this year. Food testing and environmental demand grew nicely in the quarter as did our thermal and geometry portfolios. Turning into academic and government, which is less than 10% of our business. Growth in the U.S. and Europe was partially offset by lumpiness in China. Year-to-date, our primary geographies have all returned to growth versus last year. Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis. Sales in Asia grew 28% with China up almost 40% and India up almost 60%, sales in the Americas grew 28% with the U.S. growing 26% and sales in Europe grew 25%. In the U.S. all end markets had strong year-over-year performance led by pharma and industrial. Academic and governments saw a return to growth for the quarter as the market continues to recover. Europe's growth was also broad-based across end markets and sub-regions. Overall, pharma drove growth with strong demand with small molecule and large molecule applications. Industrial and academic and government markets continued their recovery with both having strong quarters and strong starts to the first half of the year. China sales were up sharply in our pharma business, and we had solid growth in our industrial and applied end market there as well. We're encouraged by our continued strength in the contract labs business due to strong execution of our growth initiatives. In India, sales for the quarter were again very strong even as the country continued to feel the effects from the pandemic. We're really grateful for the hard work and dedication of our colleagues, who persevered through these challenging and tragic conditions. Trends in Q2 and year-to-date for our LC instrument portfolio is a positive indicator for sustainable growth in consumables and service plans. In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies at more than 40% growth driven by our instrument replacement initiative and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our PREMIER instruments both Arc and ACQUITY lines. This week, I spent time with customers at our Immerse innovation lab in Cambridge, discussing the separation and purification of mRNA and oligonucleotide molecules. While mRNA vaccines have developed at a record pace, we are far from solving key issues such as aggregation and selective binding of plasmids and mRNA molecules to various surfaces, something that our PREMIER technology addresses really well. Further strengthening our UPLC portfolio, the Arc system was launched earlier this year for customers, who need ultimate sensitivity. The Arc PREMIER delivers fivefold improvement in detector sensitivity and tenfold improvement in asset to asset precision helping labs accelerate time to market. Mass spec sales grew in excess of 30% driven by demand from pharma research and development and food and environmental applications. This included high-resolution systems used for research applications such as the Xevo QTof, tandem quad led by our Xevo TQ-XS and TQ-S Microsystems and our SQD and QDa single quad detectors utilized in high-performance LCMs applications. We introduced the Waters' SELECT SERIES MRT, a high resolution mass spectrometer that combines Multi Reflecting Time-of-Flight, MRT technology with both enhanced DESI and new MALDI imaging sources. The MRT provides scientists with a unique combination of speed, resolution and mass accuracy, especially relevant for applications in proteomics. We have been in conversations with customers to see how we can collaborate using MRT to analyze libraries of samples to create a database of proteins and metabolites to further understand the impact of therapeutics on a variety of issues. Sales of precision chemistry columns, sample prep kits and reagents grew 28% driven by increased utilization by our pharma customers and improved industrial demand. Demand for our premier columns continues to be strong. The low double-digit two years stack growth of chemistry columns revenue in Q2 when compared to our 2019 base underscores the rebound and customer activity, the strong position of our portfolio and building momentum of our e-commerce initiative. Service also showed strong double-digit growth. Our service engineers continue to have good and improved access to our customer sites and I'm grateful for the way they have served customers while continuing to navigate the challenges of the pandemic. Finally, with respect to TA demand continues to rebound and was balanced across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in the U.S. and Europe. Let me now give you some highlights on our progress with implementation of our transformation plan on Slide 7. Starting that our first priorities are gaining our commercial momentum. We continue to see progress in our instrument replacement initiative, a released Arc HPLC has played an important role in the LC replacement initiative. It's improved mechanical specs and ability to seamlessly transfer methods from alliance HPLC or other HPLC platforms have been very well received by our customers. We're already crossing the mid-single digit stack growth versus 2019 on a year-to-date basis in LC. With our CRO and CDMO customers, our ability to develop and provide method transfer support continues to be a strong driver of growth. This segment grew 60% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2019. Early trends that we saw in China has now been replicated in Europe, as well as in the U.S. Our e-commerce and recurring revenue attachment initiatives are also starting to boost the momentum of drug in our year-to-date two years stacked CAGR for chemistry and service revenue. Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8. We have strengthened our organization with the addition of wage to our Board of Directors. They currently serve as President of their pharmaceuticals for China and APAC. As results driven experience will further \u2013 they further expand the perspective of the Board that directly aligns with what are the strategy to accelerate growth and innovation. I'm also pleased to welcome Dr. Daniel Rush to Water as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Transformation. Dan joins us from Bristol-Myers, where he was VP of Worldwide Commercialization Strategy and Innovation. Dan joined several of our technically trained executive committee members that experience in orchestrating transformations in M&A, in relevant to customer segments like pharma and diagnostics. This things need to our third priority of building our core to drive durable growth. As you will see on Slide 9, Waters' already has a strong foundation in large and going at markets with a leading position of science and innovation and a roughly $65 billion market. A high exposure \u2013 high exposure to end markets that go around mix single digits that has deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA-QC. A large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic race with over 40% \u2013 almost 40% sales in Asia and industry leading margins are the strong financial flexibility. So you'll agree with me that this is a solid base to build off? Now I'm on Slide 10. To build a team of leaders who have a strong track record of execution, both Jon Pratt and Jianqing Bennett, Heads of the Waters division, and the TA division respectively are highly experienced commercial leaders and are now very focused on building capabilities to sustain our commercial momentum. What gives me most pleasure is that we have started to hit our stride with new product introductions across the portfolio. And these are contributing to our sales momentum, already. Leadership that is focused on execution and innovation is preparing us well to further build our portfolio to access even faster, growing adjacencies. They are exploring and nurturing opportunities, both organic and inorganic to increase our exposure to biologics, be it bio-processing reagents are novel modalities. They are actively shaping the promise of LCMs and diagnostics and proteomics discovery applications and advancing lab connectivity applications to our informatics portfolio. High growth areas such as sustainable polymers and renewable energy are a focus of the TA division. In summary, we've had a strong start to the year with a broad base \u2013 with broad based contributions from our end markets, product portfolio and geographies to our revenue growth. In addition to the impressive growth versus our 2020 base of comparison, our business dynamics and customer demand look healthy on a two-year runway basis. Markets we serve are in a healthy state and our geographic regions are re-bonding solidly from pandemic lows. We remain focused on the continued progress and success of our short-term initiatives in that tactically strengthening our core business. We're confident in the opportunities ahead to bring LCMS products, separations expertise, and compliant data management experience into high-growth biopharma and diagnostic applications. I look forward to continuing to share more with you as we progress on these various fronts. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the second quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Amol? Thank you, Amol. In summary, there is much to be pleased about the first half of the year driven by strong growth across our major end markets. Thanks to solid execution and double-digit growth in instrument sales we saw broad-based revenue growth across every region. Our transformation plan continues to progress the commercial momentum and strong leadership team in place. We now turn towards deploying our strategy in large and growing end markets. We operate through accelerating innovation to our portfolio as well as progressively aligning our portfolio with higher growth areas in adjacent markets. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? So, thank you, Tycho, for the question. Look the LC placement cycle, last time I said we are in the third innings using a baseball analogy. I would say we're now in the seventh inning or so in terms of having tracked down all customers that are relevant for replacement, especially our own and to some extent our competitors. I would say we have reached out to almost 80% of our own customers and 20% to 30% of the competitive replacements, both across LC as well as mass spec. And we've recently, as I told you, added that UPLC segment to it as well. So really we start with the customers really solid, solid feedback, and especially with the introduction of Arc HPLC last year and now the promise of the Arc PREMIER, as well as the ACQUITY premier columns, which are really relevant for high-end separations. We're having very good luck with and very good performance with our LC replacement initiative. So from an overall contribution perspective, I would say we should think about it in terms of the stacked growth. So if you just look at our first half of the year, our organic constant currency stacked growth versus 2019 is roughly 7%. And if you compare it to our peer group over the same period on a stacked basis, and we've seen numbers anywhere ranging from about 2.5% to 3% to closer to 5-ish percent. So that if you take a weighted average gives you a lead of let's say 2% to 3% versus the roughly defined market. And I would say part of it is explained by our initiatives and part of it is explained \u2013 there's 2% to 3% lead versus the market, part of it is explained by outperformance of our initiatives and the LC replacement initiative being a strong contributor to it and part of it is replaced by really a strong uptake of our new products. I hope that gives you a bit of color and some quantification, and the best way to compare it is to just look at the stacked growth versus the overall market. And we are now trending, I think, probably second or third quarter in a row of our market plus organic performance. Sure. So again, just first the facts, Tycho. For the second half of the year, stack growth would lead us to between slightly \u2013 north of 5% to slightly north of 6%, right. So that's, I mean, a year ago who would have thought that we would be here already. So, I mean, we're very happy with the ability to provide such a guidance. Across the three end markets, pharma goes from strength to strength and our strong presence in pharma benefits us as you can see disproportionately, so we expect that to continue. And on industrial, as you know, it can be quite a lumpy market, but if you again look at the fact growth of industrial, we are slightly higher than our overall average, which is closer to 5%, so we're closer to 6% on a stock basis for industrial growth on a year-to-date basis. So that again bodes well, I mean, again if you look at it over a longer period of time, it bodes well for what we're seeing on the industrial side, barring any sort of cyclicality due to the pandemic reemerging strongly. We think that trend should continue for the balance of the year. And then finally, academic and government, which is our smallest segment has backed quite an important one to place, especially our mass spec instruments, for the first half of the year was roughly on a stack base was roughly around 17% growth versus last year. And we expect that trend to start emerging even more strongly in the second half of the year. So we feel reasonably good across all three markets. I mean in the simplest way despite the pandemic, most of our customers and our teams have figured out how to work through the difficulties. I mean that's \u2013 there's not 100% access everywhere, but I feel they figured out a way to work through the ups and downs of the pandemic. I hope that gives you some color. Well, let me start with the instrument piece and then I'll pass over to Amol for the second part of the question. Under instrument piece, Vijay, I mean, we are really, really pleased with what we're seeing from \u2013 for three reasons. Number one, our initiatives are working extremely well, I mean, having a 40% to 45% growth versus last year, and then more impressively trending above our long-term average and we're already at mid single digits on instrument growth on a stack basis bodes very well. Second, it's equally important as you look at the recurring revenues and the impact on the recurring revenues, and you start to see some of that impact on the recurring revenues for the first half of the year already, the more \u2013 the larger the instrument placement, the larger the recurring revenues. And then finally, the third piece is around innovation. I mean our innovation across and this is probably the most enduring aspect of the transformation now. Our innovation is starting to hit its strides across the portfolio, right? You've talked \u2013 you asked about the instruments, so let me focus on that. We introduced Arc HPLC last year and I've talked several times about its benefit in China and the rest of the world for the workhorse \u2013 HPLC segment, we launched the Arc and the ACQUITY PREMIERE, which are also doing extremely well. In fact, ironically, the launch of ACQUITY PREMIERE has led to even increased demand for I-Class and H-Class \u2013 H-Class portfolio, which is meant for separating biologics and looking at high-end separations. So the portfolio across LC is really, really revitalized. And then on the mass spec side, having introduced new platforms for the tandem quads in 2019, the latest is the MRT, the multi-reflecting Tof and we have a lot of interest from our customers on that front. It's early days on where the sales will land on that. As you know, these are big ticket items, and they're also dependent upon capital outlays, but I feel very good about where we stand with our instrument initiative, the instrument replacement initiative, but even more importantly, how innovation is helping us to stay in that placement. Going forward, I mean, Jon Pratt and [indiscernible] thing will integrate this instrument replacement approach into our commercial execution. So this would not be new starting \u2013 starting late this year or early next year. So very happy with where we are. Amol, on the guide? So, Vijay, we're very happy that there are additional therapies, so Alzheimer's coming out to the market and that was great news for patients. Look, it's very early to quantify and start thinking about exactly the impact of this therapy on our business. And it's suffice it to say we are well specked in most of the compounds that are in the late stages, especially in the QA-QC domain of large and small molecules. So, that's where I'll \u2013 that's as much as I will comment on it. I think it's too early to comment on the specifics and the quantification of such an opportunity. Thank you, Doug. I can't help, but laugh about the overall question, not that I'm making fun of the question, I just \u2013 it's a long \u2013 it's a serious progress in a year. But to answer your question legitimately, I would say it has to \u2013 if you look at the long-term growth, I won't give you a number. I think it's very difficult to do it. What you can safely assume is our ambition is to remain a top-tier performer, especially when you look at the organic growth, right. So we've now for the last two or three quarters on a stacked basis have been market plus and our margins remain at the high-end of the industry. So that's our ambitions, right. So, I mean, that's what I'll tell you. Is it 4%, 5%, 6%? I don't know, but if it's 4%, we have the ambition to be higher than 4%, if it's 5%, it's higher, and you can go on from there. But there are two drivers that make me confident, actually three drivers that make me confident that we can be at the higher-end of the market. Number one, we've put a very solid team together with experienced leaders, who have shown in the past that they can execute very well above market \u2013 on the above market growth and they have experience in of course conducting transformations and integrations. So I feel very good about the team we've put together. Second, we're starting to develop a rhythm in our execution and you end up seeing the results, but we see a lot of leading indicators. And I've tried to give you some color around the different initiatives. And these are initiatives should \u2013 that should help us in longer-term. The LC replacement initiative has changed the way we work at Waters or probably brought us back to where Waters started long time ago, and looking at each and every replacement initiative and diligently going after through our CRM channel. That's a long-term improvement and execution. E-commerce, last year, at the same time we were less \u2013 less than 20% of our consumables went through the e-commerce channel. Today that number is in excess of 25%, that's in less than a year. And there is a long runway ahead of us in seeing the benefit of that execution. We've started to tap into newer customer segments. And again, I mean, I was pretty open about how underweighted we were in the CRO, CDMO, food testing segments in China. And there we've just started to hit the side. And you can see on a two year stack basis that's 60% growth, on a one year stacked basis that's a 40% growth in the same channel. And we are seeing our value proposition resonate very well with our customers. Our sales teams are super excited about what we're hearing from our customers. So these \u2013 the execution platforms that we've built, and I've just gone through three of these are going to help us for many, many years to come. And the last piece is innovation, which is most endearing to me. I mean, we have really been very precise about identifying unmet needs, and this is something definitely I don't take credit for. This has been going on at Waters for a long period of time. It was just starting to rekindle it and focusing us on the right problems to solve. We've seen already the impact of the recent launches in LC, the MRC is strengthening our high-res mass spec portfolio, the PREMIERE launch for the PREMIER \u2013 the PREMIER technology for columns as \u2013 could not have come at a better timing given the need for continued separation of more complex modalities, which have a higher affinity to metal. So I feel very good that there is a team in place that has a strong execution track record both organic and inorganic execution and the pipeline is starting to hit its stride. And I think that gives me confidence that wherever the market is, we can have the ambition to be a market class. Okay, I hope that gives you color. Thanks. Thanks again, Doug. I'll let Amol comment on how we're thinking about margin progression in a second. But I mean you should also look at the impact of additional instrument placement on the recurring revenues. And then when I talk about innovation and sustainability, the recurring revenues on a two year stack basis are double digits, right? Especially \u2013 our two year stack basis \u2013 sorry, chemistry is double digits and recurring revenues are high single digits on a two year stack basis, on a one year stack basis it's a double digit performance. So instrument placement helps with consumables placement, which are, of course, higher margin part of the business. I'll let Amol comment on your \u2013 on the breakdown of the margin. Good morning. Yes. So thanks Derik. I think off the bat, I mean, of course we can't be specific on where the immediate M&A opportunity or the midterm M&A opportunity is for obvious reasons. But from a capital deployment perspective, I mean, we remain flexible, right? I think that's been our \u2013 that's been our approach and disciplined, right? So this is basically something that you've heard us say many, many times. Now, in terms of the specific \u2013 in terms of the specific areas where we're interested, of course, given our very strong core, I mean we want to continue to invest in our core. If there are better technologies to perform separations that are dedicated to novel modalities to biologics, I mean we are very well placed to nurture those and capture those. And that's an area that we're looking at cheaply. We're looking at augmenting our instruments with automation. We continue to chase that space rather carefully. If I move to informatics, Empower is the leader in chromatography data that we also have the concept of creating a connected lab. And there too, we look for partnerships and expanding our portfolio, that's in the core. If you look outside the core, really where we see our technology is growing and some of the attractive data that we see our technology is going of course one of them is bioprocessing where we think step decoupling the process from the product is an imperative, and we believe technologies such as LCMS and technologies such as BioAccord in particular can help us help us achieve that objective. And we're seeing very good traction on that front, especially as we seed instruments earlier and earlier with our customers. So I feel very good about that. And then secondly, in and I've talked about LCMs in particular, and I'll let Amol comment on this as he gives you this view on capital deployment as well. On LCMs in particular we feel it's a technology that belongs in diagnostics and enhancing our ability to examine proteins in addition to \u2013 in addition to being genomics into that segment. So I feel very good about what we are doing on the LSMs front its early days, but we've done some pilots. We think we can do a fair bit organically, but we also might require partnerships. So that hopefully gives you a flavor of the areas we're thinking off. Amol, did you want to comment a bit on how we are thinking about. Yes. Thanks, Patrick for the question. I'm super excited about what's happening in China. We have a new leader for the last few months, and she's been making a tremendous changes that I've lead to acceleration. In the first quarter you'll remember that, that the pandemic hit China first. So the first quarter also actually weaker than the second quarter in China until you'll see a bit of a comp effect, but fundamentally all the initiatives that we've launched at global level are on China speed in China, right? So let me explain. From a factual perspective, right, so the second quarter growth was roughly 40% versus the previous year driving that instruments, the Arc HPLC was the design for the China market, and it's done very well, especially given its better performance in any of the \u2013 any of the other instruments available in the market. Second, from a consumables perspective we've seen really good progress on in China, in \u2013 mostly in the \u2013 even in excess of the instrument growth in some cases. And then finally on the CRO, CDMO and CTO sort of initiative; remember we talked about the food market in the past and we've said we were underweight in the food market. In China we've seen very good growth there; almost doubling of the business versus the same period last year. And then sort of CRO and the CDMO piece are -- the growth that I've mentioned was a global growth meaning 60% on a full year \u2013 on a two year stack basis. This in China is \u2013 this turnaround of growth for CRO, CDMO segment started in China. So feel very good about what's happening in China. And we'll just, I would say we've just begun on looking at newer segments, like the contract testing segments, both in food and pharma. We've started to work really efficiently and effectively on our presence and placement of instruments. And I feel very good about what we're going to do on the consumer growth side as well. So I hope that gives you a bit of color on what we see in China. Just to first quantify a little bit, right, so we said there are about 8,000 or so alliance instruments that that required a placement at our own 4,000-ish which is half the number for UPLC Acuity, and about 1,000 Tandem Quads, right? So varying degrees of progress on all of those, they should continue for a little bit of time, while we work through our own portfolio and then turn our attention to the competitive portfolio as well. Which especially on the LC side, whatever is plugged into Empower with gold, our reps that any time there's a replacement there, we want to be \u2013 we want to be in competition, especially if it's a competitive instrument. So your question is more around what challenges it creates for the future. First, let me start with the opportunity; the opportunity is that as you have more instruments base, you start to see a better recording revenue. I think that is the first and the most important piece. The second is on the placement cycle. This will become modus operandi as soon as we brought to our own installed base, and as we moved to our competitors installed base are playbook, which has been honed over the last six months or so is now becoming standard operating procedure for our reps around the globe. So it will be \u2013 of course, I mean from a mathematical perspective the growth on the instrument side has been terrific. I mean, we think it's a benefit for our recurring revenues both service and consumables. But it's becoming our modus operandi as we go forward. So Waters will no longer be letting instruments and perhaps even competitors go off our install base. Yes. I think Josh, it's a very good question. And last week I was at our Immerse site, Immerse Innovation site in Cambridge Mass, and had an opportunity to talk to several customers, especially ones who are now working in the mRNA space and the SiRNA space. And I would say universally, we're far from having solved the challenges for separating oligonucleotides and mRNA molecules, right. And if you just think of the progression there, number one, large number of large \u2013 very large number of compounds in the pipeline that are now leveraging the mRNA technology. And you must've seen some recent acquisitions in this space as well. But if you break the problem down from a separation standpoint, there's the plasmid, there is the mRNA molecule, and then there's also the lipid nanoparticle. For all three of these [indiscernible] we are far from having solved the aggregation problem, the problem with affinity to metal surfaces. And as I said earlier, the introduction of the premiere technology couldn't have come at a better time. So I believe given the further investment in the pipeline of molecules in this space, basically oligo-based compounds, our technological focus especially on separations of these complex molecules. First with the premier technology and others that we're working on bodes very well for what we see in the future. And I can tell you that I mean customers, while we have delivered \u2013 while the customers and us working together have delivered vaccines in record times, they're very far from having native and efficient process. So something that is a significant opportunity for Waters from an innovation standpoint, as you go forward. So thanks for your question, Jack. Look from a supply chain perspective we have so far managed really rally with our suppliers and we are monitoring any dynamics in the supply chain, including ships that are stranded on the West Coast of the U.S. So we're very closely monitoring all those changes. We are in constant conversation with our suppliers so far so good. But I mean we are monitoring s things change, especially on electronic box. Let me also we're to Amol, to talk about the gross margin. Thank you all for your participation and questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our third quarter of 2021 call, which we currently anticipate holding on November 2, 2021. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Udit. Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. As Udit outline, we recorded next sales of $682 million in the second quarter, an increase of 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4%, resulting in reported sales growth of 31%. Looking at the product line growth, our recurring revenue which represents combination of chemistry and service revenue increased by 18% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 40%. Chemistry revenues went up 28%, and servicing revenues were up 13%. As we noted in our last earnings call, recurring revenues were not impacted by a difference in calendar days this quarter. Looking ahead, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of days for the third quarter either. However, please note there are six fewer days in the fourth quarter of this year, compared to 2020. Now, I would like to comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Before I do so, a reminder that in the second quarter of 2020 we took decisive actions to manage our costs as part of our near-term cost savings plan in light of the pandemic, while our COVID cost savings plan was successful, totaling approximately $100 million for 2020; it does have some implications in not year-over-year comparisons as we normalize from an abnormally low expense base. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, gross margin improved by 70 basis points, despite higher instrument mix and COVID cost actions in 2020. This improvement was driven by volume leverage and productivity gains. Moving down to P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis, and 42% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributable to higher labor costs and variable compensation, the majority of which relates to normalization of the prior year cost actions. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%, a decrease from last year as the comparable period including some unfavorable discrete items. Our average share count came in at 60.2 million shares, approximately flat versus a second quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares increased to $2.69 come back to $1.98 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and exclude's special items. In the second quarter of 2021 free cash flow declined 12% year-over-year to $155 million after funding $37 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation, a $38 million tax reform payment, and 3 million litigation's settlement receipt. In the second quarter this resulted in $0.23 of each $1 of sales converted into free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow has increased 17%, to $348 million. In the second quarter accounts receivable DSO came in at 73 days, down 14 days compared to the second quarter of last year. Inventories increased slightly by 5 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, repurchased approximately 535,000 shares of our common stock for $168 million in the second quarter. At the end of second quarter, our net debt position was $940 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent, invest for growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities. In addition, we will evaluate deploying capital to well taught out attractive and adjacent growth opportunities. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide you some update on our parts for 2021 on Slide 11. In the first half of the year, we saw good momentum in our market segments, driven by robust demand and strong commercial execution. We believe that this momentum will continue in the second half of the year, but the comparisons are more challenging. Fourth quarter of 2020 was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by higher year end budget plus spending. In addition, we have six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. We are also keeping a watchful eye on the potential impact of newer COVID variance and the likely disruption they may cause to both supply and demand. We expect our near-term growth initiatives and commercial momentum to contribute meaningfully to our performance. These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth. At current rates the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 to 2 percentage points resulting in a full-year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be $37 million and full year tax rate to be 15%. Average diluted 2021 share count is expected to be approximately 62 million. Throughout the year we'll evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all of these together and on a non-GAAP basis full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range $10.50 to $10.70. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at today's rates and assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID. Looking at the third quarter of 2021 we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%. At today's rates currency translation is expected to add approximately 1 percentage point resulting in third-quarter reporting sales growth guidance of 8% to 10%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.25 to $2.35. This includes a positive currency impact of approximately 3 percentage point at today's rates and also assumes no worst demand or supplying back from COVID. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes, sure. And, Vijay, to follow on your question on six fewer days in Q4, I mean, that impacts our recurring revenue particularly service because service is accrued on a day-by-day basis for the annual contracts, as well as it impacts our chemistry revenue because of lesser utilization days in the quarter. And so at this point with six days it has roughly 3 percentage point impact in the sales realized in the quarter from six less days. Yes. Now, let me look from a longer-term outlook point of view from our margin profile, as you know, we have one of the best margins within the industry. We have a very disciplined sort of margin management profile within the company. And then as you step back, there are so many opportunities in terms of margins, right. One, as Udit mentioned, there is a huge opportunity in increasing our recurring revenue attachment rates and recurring revenue is a higher margin product or between chemistry and service, and that helps expand margin. As you look into operations, I mean, there's a huge effort underway on operational excellence and our procurement programs, which are starting to deliver and that would help our margin profile. We have a similar program underway on our service productivity initiatives, and that will expand margin and then there is the whole area around capability centers, and we haven't really invested in capability centers so far, and that will bring margin expansion. Now at the same time, as Udit outlined we continue to explore and nurture really fantastic adjacent growth opportunities, and those opportunities will need some investment. So the general plan is to use this margin expansion in some way to fund some of these investment opportunities and yet to deliver part of a steady margin profile. And as these programs deliver growth, you will see margin expansion show up over time. I think you've covered it well, and Derik as we outlined in our prepared remarks, right, our priority with the clear product there is growth and the team work there is well thoughtout as we look at, I guess in growth opportunities, and that's how we will look at capital deployment, right? We will pursue growth, remain flexible, but be well thought out in what we choose. Sure. So we do track our product vitality index and we look at it as products on the instrument side launched in the last three years and products on the chemistry side launched in the last five years. On our product quality index was close to 12% in the second quarter. We had very little, over to be nothing in terms of COVID impact on our Q2 revenue. Yes. So on the gross margin, right, I mean, usually, typically in the March month, we take merit increases up. But that merit increase doesn't travel into the P&L because the inventory turns right on the gross margin side. And if you assume sort of a 3% merit increase, that will only travel into the P&L second half of the year with the inventory turns. So that sort of explains why gross margin is lower in the second half versus the first time."

Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Waters President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Water's Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim CFO. I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic. We have not yet seen a uniformed recovery as there are still many regions around the world that are being ravaged by the pandemic. As many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment. Our colleagues and customers there are very much on our minds and we are working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families and we're doing all we can to support our customers. During today's call I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our three-phase transformation plan focused on number one, beginning our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening on organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. Next I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter and full-year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Briefly reviewing our operating results for the first quarter, revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year. This strong start to the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier than expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and s strong commercial execution by our team. Looking more closely at our topline results, first from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double-digits during the first quarter. Our largest market category Pharma grew 28% in constant currency. Industrial grew 24% and Academic and Government grew 29%. Moving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 41% with China up 109%. Sales in Americas grew 14% with the U.S. growing 13% and sales in Europe grew 25%. From an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26% while DA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis. Customer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way, driving better than expected trends in recurring revenues and a significant growth in instrument revenue. Recurring revenue grew 15% with Services growing 14% and Chemistry Consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand. LC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth. It is encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units growth double-digits driven by pent up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative. The success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated and the ACQUITY Premier has been received very well by customers since its February launch. Mass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the Pharma market remained robust in addition to rebounds we saw in other markets including clinical food and environmental and biomedical research. Demand was solid for our Tandem Quads in Europe and China, particularly in Pharma and in food. Finally, to TA, revenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma, medical devices and semiconductors. Growth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis. Looking deeper at our sales performance by geography, all major regions grew double-digits. China built further on last quarter strength more than doubling sales year-over-year. Results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions. Pharma was particularly strong in China driven by triple digits growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine. Our food business in China also saw meaningful growth driven by significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that we're above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019. This is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved. India sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country. Europe experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and Academic and Government markets. In the U.S., both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter, while demand in our Academic and Government market remained soft as it lagged behind other markets and reopened. In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broad-based than last quarter, with impressive performance across all our regions, end markets, and product categories. Pharma demand has not subsided and many of our non-pharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year. Now, I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the company, the effectiveness of the markets that we serve and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term. Our three-phased transformation plan is; number one, beginning our commercial momentum; number two, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. Looking at our first priority of regaining our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously. First, instrument replacements initiatives, we delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%. In February, we launched the ACQUITY Premier system augmenting the already solid placement Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020 creating new opportunities for instrument replacements. Additionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging Tandem Quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments. Second, as part of our CRO's CDMO expansion initiative, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double-digits in both these customer segments. Customers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor. Third, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, search engine optimization and page search have led to first impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year. While not every click translates to immediate revenue, increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts. Fourth, driving launch excellence, let me start with liquid chromatography. While the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY Premier. Last year we launched the ACQUITY Premier columns and followed that up with the ACQUITY Premier system last quarter. Though we are still in the early stages of the revenue ramp up for both, the columns and the systems saved the ACQUITY Premier columns as significantly outpacing the prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY columns. Turning to mass spec, in 2019 we launched the BioAccord Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next generation version of our TQ-S micro. Pairing our Tandem Quads with ACQUITY Premier creates industry leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays. With expanding applications of the BioAccord we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile easy to use and robust LC-MS system to the QA-QC space. During Q1 we launched workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new Waters connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level. This adds to already existing simple to use applications of peptide mapping, intact subunit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation. Over the last year we established the BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines. In fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and relief efforts. Lastly, Cyclic was launched in September 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high-resolution mass spec users. Augmenting traditional LCMS with high-resolution ion mobility allows us to separate molecules with additional, but identical molecular weight, based on their different shapes. This is now especially relevant for monitoring structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications and we're addressing this through the development and rollout of our Waters connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio. Today, Waters connect support biopharma characterization and monitoring blood flows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord Xevo QTof and [indiscernible]. And with the launch of our RDa Benchtop -- Benchtop Tof in Q1 Waters Connect also enabled small molecular flows. We are grateful to have earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software. Next on our TA Instruments division, last year we launched the X3 DSC which offers unique advantages for routine high throughput labs and R&D especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials. The ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes, where scientists can evaluate multiple combinations in parallel reducing time to market. The more time I spend with my R&D colleagues together with our customers, the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply technical culture. Moving on to our second priority. You've already seen the planned leadership transitions we announced last month. Amol Chaubal will join us as CFO on May 12. Amol has deep experience in pharma and diagnostics and has led many transformations in his prior roles, through both organic and inorganic growth. I would like to sincerely thank Michael Silveira for his four months of service as Interim CFO. Mike will continue to serve as our corporate controller and I am pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of chief accounting officer. Secondly, we've established a dedicated Innovation Board which I will share, that includes leaders from R&D, business development and marketing. The Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof-of-concept and monitor the execution of top R&D programs. Thirdly, I'd like to thank Mike Harrington and Ian King, our SVPs of Global Markets and Global Products respectively for their decades of dedication to Waters. Though their retirements are effective July 2, they have graciously offered to serve as consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. Finally, we welcome our own Jon Pratt as the leader of the Waters division, while Jianqing Bennett will succeed Jon at the DA Division. Both Jon and Jianqing have brief commercial and transformation experience and global leadership roles in fast growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing. I am really pleased with our new team and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months. That brings us to our third priority, aligning our portfolio with high growth areas. While we won't take our IR commercial execution which remains our top priority we have recently started our strategic planning process. Now I'd like to share with you some high level thoughts on where we are today. Our number one priority is to continue strengthening the core, meaning LC-MS and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service and consumables. Second, we're starting into faster growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers. These adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies, or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LC-MS into diagnostics or other high growth markets. Lastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure, and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top tier ROIC. Over the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainability grow in this attractive market. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mike?\nMichael Silveira: Thank you, Udit. Good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4% resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported. Looking at product line growth, our revenue -- our recurring revenue which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%. Chemistry revenues were up 18% for the quarter driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand. On the service side of our business revenues were up 14%. As customers continued to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance professional services and repair visits. As we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales are impacted by five additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues. Looking ahead, compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter. However, there are six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. Breaking first quarter operating segment sales down further, sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA Instrument sales grew 28%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%. Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable FX. Moving down, the first quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation cost and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years. In the first quarter our effective operating tax rate was 14%, an increase from last year as compared to the comparable period included some favorable discreet items in the prior year. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances. Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment in our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items. In the first quarter of 2021 free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to a $193 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the first quarter this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Our increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and bettered operating margins compared to the prior year. In the quarter accounts receivable days sale outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year. Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes. Waters maintained a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter. These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about one time at the end of the first quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent; investor growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities and as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process. As we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets. As we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021. One, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segment which will help us exceed the 2019 levels. Two, we believe this momentum will continue until the second quarter, but that a strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the six fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter. Three, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Four, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly through our performance. These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for cost and currency sales growth of 8% to 11%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%. Every year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% to 29%, based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID related cost and disciplined expense controls. Moving now, below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows. Net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, a full-year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%, the net impact of our share repurchase program 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly update as appropriate. Drilling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05 which assumes a positive currency impact on full-year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. Looking at the second quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%. At today's rates currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize. At current rates the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point. Now I'd like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Mike. In summary, there is much to be pleased about with our first quarter results driven by strong growth across each of the major end markets with Pharma leading the way. Thanks to solid execution and double-digit growth in instrument sales, we saw broad-based revenue growth across every region, with China sales more than doubling. Our transformation plan is well underway with commercial momentum and a strong leadership team in place. We now turn towards developing a new strategy as we work more closely to align our portfolio with higher growth areas of the market. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: And our first question comes from Dan Brennan, UBS. Sir, your line is open, you may go ahead.\nDaniel Brennan: Great, thank you, thanks for the question and congrats obviously on the strong start to the year. Maybe just looking at the guidance, Udit, if you don't mind, I know you talked about six less days in the fourth quarter and tough comps, but nonetheless you had strong start and the good second quarter guidance, your full-year guidance does imply something on the order of 1% growth in the back half of the year. So maybe could you just tease out a little bit, like what's going on with the back half, like how much are you still assuming to obtain that with us, just any further color there, because I would expect that will be a question that we\u2019re going to be getting?\nUdit Batra: Firstly, thanks Dan and good morning. Look, we are very pleased with the first quarter, and as we look at the rest of the year, I mean as Mike also mentioned, the pandemic is still ongoing, that's the first consideration. Second we saw pent up demand we released in Q1 which had five extra days, so that grew our base quite nicely. And the second half has a higher comp which makes us prudent as we guide towards the full year. Now of course, if our initiatives continue to do what they're doing and we see good execution there, and the other end markets continue to improve, we would be on the higher end of that guidance. So I think to me it's a prudent or to use another word, wise guidance, which basically takes these factors into account.\nDaniel Brennan: Okay, and then you talked a lot about new product launches, particularly on LC side, is it possible to see that a little bit in terms of what impact these are actually having? Again really strong 27% organic growth, but could you give us a flavor for kind of the impact from these new product launches in the quarter, and kind of what you're assuming for the full year? And then if you could also make any comments on what you are seeing from the relative market share trends across LC and LC-MS?\nUdit Batra: Sure. I think first on new products. I'm very excited about our whole portfolio across LC, across mass spec, across informatics. In terms of overall quantitation, I mean I think as we look at the contribution, it's probably 2% to 3%, is it a bit higher or bit lower, I think you would have to do very sophisticated math, but it's 2% to 3% contribution. And that's quite impressive, especially on the LC side given the launch has just took place, right? So for Arc HPLC, it was launched only in June of last year, smack in the middle of the pandemic and that has had great uptake especially in China for general purpose HPLC. And then that ACQUITY Premier, the columns were launched last year and we saw, I would say absolutely terrific uptake, in fact better than the ACQUITY launched originally. And then finally, as I look at the mass spec growth, I mean our replacement initiative is doing well, especially with the launch of our renewed Tandem Quad portfolio. So, really lot to be excited about on the new products side.\nDaniel Brennan: And if I could just one more and this is China obviously you are up against an easy countdown 45 or thereabouts, about 120% growth is certainly significant. Just how do we think about, you know, you were facing some unique challenges in China over the past couple of years in Food and Pharma, how do we think about the door [ph] like what's kind of expected from here as you think about this full 2021 guide for China?\nUditBatra: Yes, absolutely, I mean super happy with China, especially given the pandemic is still not over and our colleagues have really done a great job of implementing our initiatives, and some of that is contributing to the growth. I mean it's terrific growth across all segments, especially Pharma which doubled and then you saw Industrial also grew very nicely. And Academic and Government was in the mid 70%. Right? So, with that said, what I would argue is Pharma is continuing to show strength. Industrial is also starting to get stronger especially in the TA business. Academic and Government on a stack basis still has some work to do. Right? So, we still want to make sure that we focus on it as the market recovers. And then I look at the portfolio side, Instruments grew very nicely, as you again saw from the prepared remarks. And the consumables portion of the business was in the mid-40s in terms of percentage growth. Look, as I look at our -- the implementation of our initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they are contributing nicely. We singled out the Food market in the past for commentary when we talked about transformations, so let me just comment on that. We saw incredible growth in the contract testing market for Food both in the Government segment and with new customers. Right? Remember I spoke about that when we talked about the transformation plan. And with the CDMO segment some of our best performance is in China. And then finally I have a lot to thank in terms of our leadership in China. We have a new leader in China and really has renewed focus on growth. That said, I would caution against taking two data points of recovery and saying that we have completely turned the business. We still remained focused, but I'm very happy with the start.\nDaniel Brennan: Great. Thanks a lot.\nMichael Silveira: Thank you for your questions.\nUditBatra: I didn't answer your question for the full year, full year I think no reason to expect anything less than high-teens in China and that would be a very good stacked growth as well versus last year.\nDaniel Brennan: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey thanks. I want to follow-up on the Instrument growth. You know 45% on a 90% comp is just pretty impressive. I'm just curious how much in your view was market pent up demand versus some of the stuff you are intentionally driving out your replacement cycle initiatives. You mentioned 2% to 3% from the products, so I get that. But how much came from new customer penetration, CROs, CDMOs? You know the main question we are going to get is kind of the sustainability of what you are seeing right now?\nUditBatra: Yes, yes, so Tycho, excellent point. I mean and then I think there are many things to be happy about on the Instrument side, right? I mean if we place more Instruments, we get more consumables and more service down the line and we saw a very nice recovery. It is a mix of everything. Right? So, we saw a recovery front, seeing continued strength in Pharma, but we also saw a nice recovery in Industrials and also in Academia. In terms of the contribution, our initiatives have been doing extremely well. Our LC replacement initiative and now we have added the mass spec initiative as well, is doing super well. And that is now being helped by the launch of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier which are allowing us to focus both on the general purpose segment, but also on the UPLC segment. So, it's very difficult to extract how much is coming from -- going and finding only replacement and then how much is coming from the new products that are actually helping that conversation. So, really added together it's a very good performance. And then also from a stacked comp basis it's looking very good as you've already commented. I mean LC is doing very nicely on a -- from a 29 basis -- from a 2019 basis and mass spec is almost double digits on that front. So, really very happy with what we've been able to do on -- do with our initiatives. And then finally on the CRO, CDMO area, I mean we have had incredible impact. Last Friday I was with -- incredible conversations with CDMOs, especially last Friday I was with the CEO of one of the leading CDMOs and they perceive us as very strong partners to help them transfer methods for complex molecules. And this is something that has come more and more to the front and center globally as we talk to many of these customers. Of course, I mean they are focused on cost, but even more importantly they are focused on transferring these methods from originators. So, I think the initiatives are doing well, but there's a lot more to do there. We've just, I mean I would say in terms of penetration of our Instrument space, we are 30% along the way on mass spec. I would say we are about slightly more than that on the LC side. So we still have fertile ground there to see more growth.\nTycho Peterson: That's helpful. And then you mentioned the Innovation Board, I am just curious, there are implications here in terms of how you are approaching R&D and what you want to spend in R&D, should we assume kind of 6%-6.5% you know if sales are still the bogey or how you think about that?\nUditBatra: Yes, I think Tycho that question came up last time as well. We don\u2019t think of R&D in percentage terms and being an engineer myself and now surrounded by people in the Innovation Board we really look at the quality of the ideas. And if the quality of the ideas are good and we see a market opportunity, we will invest behind it. So, let me give you an example. As LC-MS or Diagnostics, right, so we work very closely with the UK Government on the COVID Moonshot program and we were able to develop LC-MS for as a diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens. This is now going to be submitted as an RUO later, mid this year or later this year for research is only, at least initially, but we see incredible traction in that area and we are investing behind it. So, those are the kinds of examples that come to the Innovation Board and if we see room to invest, we will. Second type of ideas where we invest our platforms, right? So, I already mentioned from a commercial perspective e-Commerce, but also taking the disparate data that exists in the organization and putting them into a data lake. Right? So, I would be loathed to tell you hey, you know, this is the ratio that we're trying to manage. Of course it's a cost conscious organization as you know from the past. We will not do silly things. At the same time if we see good ideas that have good basis, we will invest behind them. So, I hope that's satisfactory.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then just lastly on the model, I am curious, the five extra days could you quantify was that added in the quarter, was that around 300 basis points? And then as we look ahead to the second quarter, given the tragedy unfolding in India, just curious how you are thinking about your exposure there in the second quarter?\nUditBatra: Let me comment on India and then I let Mike comment on the contribution of the extra days. Look, I mean our heart goes out to everybody who is going through the pandemic in India. We have still seen our customers as you can imagine continue to produce small molecules and large molecules to address the challenges of the pandemic. And so our sales are tracking that and we are very heavily focused on the LC market in India, which is still the method of choice to release small molecules that India continues to produce. So, we're seeing very good growth, very good access for our service engineers despite the pandemic. I do expect it to be bumpy, but the underlying demand as we look at the full year I would expect to continue to rise. Mike, on the extra days?\nMichael Silveira: Yes, on the five additional days, it added about 3% of growth to our recurring revenues in the quarter.\nOperator: And thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Kumar, Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on a really strong fin this morning. I proved from the, and may be on the first one. I look at the guidance to 2Q, 14% to 16% constant currency. I mean, your comps actually get easier for 2Q. If I look at the 27% you guys did in Q1, x days it was about 24. So, can you maybe just walk us through the 24 to perhaps 15, 16 for 2Q? Was there any timing element which pulled forward from Q2 or is this perhaps like you said prudent guidance?\nUditBatra: Yes, I think Vijay you answered your own question. It's actually prudent guidance. I mean given that the pandemic is still not over, there was a bit of pent up demand that came also from last year into Q1, not a pull forward from Q2. And then finally, I mean our initiatives are ongoing. They have shown incredible traction. We're very happy with what's happening. However, I think they still are getting traction. Right? I mean despite the pandemic we have seen good traction for our LC initiative. We are seeing good traction for e-Commerce where the page views have increased quite dramatically. We have seen good traction in reaching out to new customers. But two data points don\u2019t make a full trend. So, we're just being wise to use another word. I think that would be the answer.\nVijay Kumar: I understood. And then another guidance question. I guess simplistically you guys beat Q1 EPS by about $0.70 and the annual guidance raised by about $0.50. Is there I guess from an expense standpoint, is this also perhaps prudence from an OpEx perspective or is there something else going on, on the spend perspective? And Mike on the Q1, 300 basis points contribution from extra days should be a zero, a 300 basis headwind in Q4, given the fewer selling days? Thank you.\nUditBatra: Mike, go ahead on the EPS.\nMichael Silveira: So from an EPS perspective, one thing to remember here is, last year with the pandemic we put in place many cost actions. For example, salaries were reduced, furloughs were put in place, spending was reduced significantly throughout the corporation. We are going to experience a huge normalization for rest of this year that will mitigate the growth of the EPS. I guess, said it another way, the kind of normalization that needs to happen this year. As far as the gross margins, this margin there was so much volume that lead to a kind of operating leverage. So that will mitigate itself the rest of the year because of that normalization that I mentioned. So, I would expect for the full year, we're going to get back for the 57.5% to 58%, but I don't expect it to be inconsistent with the past.\nVijay Kumar: Go it, yes, sorry on the days, is that a 300 basis point headwind in Q4?\nMichael Silveira: Headwinds, that would be about a 3%. \nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey thanks. This is Mark Ruskin on for Derik, first he is taking a question. I want to follow up on some of your comments earlier on sort of the Instrument growth you saw in the quarter and you gave a lot of prepared remarks on. Have you been able to drive some of the upgrades and replacements? I am just wondering if you could comment, how many of those were competitive or you are replacing existing product, and you know you are having to discount to drive upgrades there, is there any bundling across the portfolio, sort of what are the puts and takes in that program that's helping you make those gains besides the comps.\nUditBatra: Sure. I think look it's virtually all of the above, but that said, but let's start with especially for LC, I mean we have the focus on solutions for our customers, and as we go in the new products definitely helps. Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premiere, especially help in having the conversation. Anything when we started the program first with our own installed base, then looking at the competitor installed base and the third step would be to look at everybody and anybody who is using Empower. Right? So, it's a pretty large pool and we have just, I would say one-third of the way with our own instruments in terms of getting that replacement cycle done. So, there's a lot of room there. That said, the conversation is more straightforward if you have new products, especially the Arc HPLC, as well the ACQUITY Premier. And then finally, given our reputation as a solid service company and our service engineers absolutely help. So, I think the answer is and your question, it's all of the above. For mass spec also, we've also launched a similar program and there the success rates are absolutely terrific. We're going after our own installed base from a Tandem Quad perspective and replacing the older instruments with the newer generation of Tandem Quads that were introduced in 2019. So nice progress. Some of it is the market, but I think a significant amount is renewed focus on the replacement cycle of older instruments and finding [ph] products and a broader value proposition. As far as pricing and bundling, except the pricing is concerned, we have not had to use heck of a lot of pricing to make this happen. People trust the quality that Waters brings and the innovation that we're bringing to them to solve these problems.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. I appreciate all that color. And then a followup on the on the -- you mentioned the strategic review process one of the areas you are thinking about, some of these faster growth adjacencies, are there any opportunities here that you see organically or is this sort of part of the strategic review that the following can be handled through M&A, obviously recognizing again the really good leverage position here?\nUditBatra: All of the above. Right? So, we will have organic initiatives. We will have partnership opportunities and we will look at inorganic options as well. Right? so, all of the above. From an organic standpoint, I can give you examples. We think the electrodiagnostics space is interesting and LC-MS is ripe to get into that space. We have made really serious progress in working closely with many academics in the UK and the NHS, to take LC-MS into their diagnostics space for pathogens with COVID-19. We also worked with folks in Sweden on the same topic and we will introduce LC-MS as a research use only technique rather in the near future. So, organically we see tremendous opportunity as well. And another example would be entering bioprocessing. We are looking at partnerships with the leading academic institutions and many of our partners to take LC-MS into the bioprocessing suite and not just leave it in the QA-QC space where we still have room to grow. And then finally on inorganic, inorganic areas we are looking at that very, very carefully and they'll be more to say about it as time progresses, so all of the above.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDouglas Schenkel: Hey, good morning everybody and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one end market question and then one guidance question. The end markets, specifically industrial, cyclical, recognizing all end markets were pretty solid, I'd love to hear more about what you're seeing in terms of the pickup and cyclical demand? And how did that evolve over the course of Q1 and are there signs that demand is picking up in a sustainable way that you know meaning just as in the catch up, it is actually a function of global economic improvement? And if you are seeing signs of that as exemplified for things, I think like backlog? Are there certain geographies where this is more or less notable? So that\u2019s the first topic. The second topic is just, again sorry to go back to guidance, but specifically below the topline as we think about operating spend, when I look at our model for Q1, R&D and SG&A together were about $10 million below our forecast. And I think we were the high on the Street for revenue and you came in $50 million above our forecast, so that was really nice leverage in the model. I'm just wondering was there any hold back on investment in the early part of the year, just given all the uncertainty because it doesn't seem like you're looking at this as any normal. I say that because it seems like guidance assumes there's going to be an increase in operating investment moving forward over the balance of the year, which I think makes sense given the strength in your business and some of the initiatives you've talked about in your prepared remarks Udit. So, I guess, I'm just hoping you could provide some clarity there. It seems like Q1 operating leverage is the new normal just because you want to invest, I just want to make sure we got that right, thank you.\nUdit Batra: Excellent question Doug. Look first on the other two end markets, Industrial and Academic and Government, I think you rightly note that it is one quarter and we are seeing a nice rebound. And I\u2019m cautious here. Right? So we\u2019re seeing good conversations with our customers about the industrial end markets are disconnect. Right? I mean, they go from polymers to semiconductors and other areas which inherently are cyclical. They are seeing good demand for hardware, especially on the TA side, but that I would say is one quarter, we\u2019re seeing good conversations, I would not start to immediately extrapolate and this is why we are a little cautious on or prudent on the guidance. On the stack growth basis, when you look at specific regions, I mean China is almost 20%, Europe is in the mid-teens in Industrial and the U.S. is mid-single-digits. So even on a stack basis this is a good performance on the Industrial end market, but largely driven by a lot of hardware spend. Now on Academic and Government, which is also the cyclical, I know you were not asking in particular, but I will take the opportunity to comment on this. Already, we saw very good growth, I mean, 29% growth overall largely driven by what we saw in China and Europe continued its strength, also 70% growth. The U.S. is still spotting and recovering. On a stacked basis, there\u2019s still work to do on China and the U.S. I mean both are still not positive versus 2019, Europe is. So I think Industrial, a little bit more confidence in the overall trend, but Academic and Government we're seeing slow return back into the different labs, more so in Europe, definitely in China but still a bit of hill to climb and Europe is 40 up and U.S. is 40 across the country. If I move to your guidance question, I will firstly give a qualitative remark and then Mike can comment on the numbers as well. We\u2019re not holding back any investment Doug. I mean, in fact, if you look at how much we have approved in terms of operating investment it\u2019s fairly significant in Q1 to start, to support our initiatives that we already mentioned. So expanding our field force in contract testing, having more informatics folks to build up Waters, Waters Connect even further and to invest behind our R&D programs, I mentioned LC-MS already and there are several others. It\u2019s just a question of the recruiting cycle taking a bit of time and people finding the right people and getting them into the system. So, really not holding back there at all. Mike, do you want to comment on the numbers?\nMichael Silveira: Sure, I will just add, with the strong customer demand that we\u2019re actually seeing, we have started to make the investment into the P&L, but all of our expenses haven\u2019t hit Q1 P&L. So you are going to see some increase in expense as we move to the rest of the year that catches up with these initiatives that Udit was referring to. This is a gated process and we do look at projects, one on, we do look at each of the products initiatives and spending on what it is and we navigated processes and we'll make sure it makes sense before we actually start the process. So it's - it is a gated process and we will expect not the leverage to be not as good as it was in Q1 the rest of this year.\nUdit Batra: And then I think one closing remark on that Doug, just reminding you how we talked about the transformations and we said look we want to get our top line growth back first. This is such a gate business and such a good install based, there\u2019s tons of leverage in the P&L that allows us to invest without any dilution. And you\u2019re seeing the sustainability of the business as we recover our topline, and it\u2019s not just towards this last year Q1, it\u2019s also on a stack basis across many different segments and geographies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hi, thanks, good morning. In terms of some of your e-commerce initiatives, are you starting to see any incremental pull-through in terms of consumables, revenue that, did you quantify and kind of what\u2019s next in terms of the e-commerce strategy and some of those initiatives over the balance of the year?\nUdit Batra: Brandon, thank you. From an e-commerce, basically just search engine optimization and paid search we saw a 45% increase according to our own numbers and I know you look at it independently as well on the number eye balls coming on to our site. It's very difficult to translate that, as you know, into the exact impact on revenues, so I won't attempt that, but you can imagine the largest impact is on the consumable side. And especially, with newer products it\u2019s worked out extremely well having the ability to drive more people onto the channel and find out more information, leading to purchase and a great uptake for our ACQUITY Premier launch. Now, in terms of the overall plan for e-commerce, I mean this is just a start. Right? So, remember I had said early on that we want to take the hand we have and do the best we can with it at the beginning as we make our plans to revitalize our platforms and I mentioned a couple of those investments in the previous question as well. So we do believe that investing in a data lake that takes all unstructured and structured data from different parts of the organization and putting that into an easily accessible middle layer will help us service our e-commerce customers better. We do believe investing in content even more is going to lead to better conversion on the e-commerce channel. We do believe investing in mobile is going to lead to a better conversion. So, you can see that there are some infrastructural investments that we have started to look at and as the organization becomes stronger and stronger, you\u2019ll start to see us invest in those. So the e-commerce plan as of few phases is the first one was just to get the quick wins and we\u2019re not done with that yet that\u2019s just the start. And there is a long term plan that will build a world class e-commerce platform for Waters. Hope that helped.\nOperator: Thank you, our next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on the capital deployment side, you know, it seems you\u2019re a bit more open about pursuing some inorganic opportunities. Can you just talk about the size that we should be thinking about how large you guys would go and then again what verticals make the most sense for you guys to pursue inorganically versus the organic investments you reckon?\nUdit Batra: Patrick, you know that I won\u2019t take that, I won\u2019t talk too much about the size and the exact ideas and the exact domains. I mean in general, you can assume that the part of the market we\u2019re in is a good mid-single-digit grower. I mean we have a bit of catch up to do, so you\u2019ll see us doing better than that in the short to midterm given the initiatives we've put in place, and the market share we\u2019ve had to, we want to climb back and gain. Right? So, I think that will be the first lift. As you look at the adjacencies there are ones that fundamentally go faster like molecular diagnostics, like bioprocessing and bioreagents and we are looking at each of those categories to see how we can organically enter those, how we can do partnerships and also looking at inorganic ideas. I mean, the process has begun and you\u2019ll hear more about it as we progress further with concrete ideas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.\nJoshua Waldman: Hi guys, I wondered if you could provide more color on the replacement initiative. I guess, what inning do you think we are in here? And I think I remember you previously saying there were about 8000 systems that you are targeting. Is this still how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity or has that number gone up? And then I guess lastly, do you think it is driving replacement of only your systems or at this point are you seeing it replace maybe competitor systems, just thinks like growth of 40% from the LC businesses, it\u2019s probably representing share gains?\nUdit Batra: Yes, thanks. I'm sure of picking it up Josh. Look, LC, the 8000 number was HPLC and UPLC only and especially on the Waters Instrument. And when you talk about innings, if you're talking about baseball, probably we are in the third inning. There\u2019s a lot more work to do and lot more to pick up there. And we haven't done that in past. We haven\u2019t replaced our own instruments. So, I mean we are going in and it\u2019s working out super well, especially with the new products being available as well and both on the HPLC side and the UPLC side. So, we\u2019re very happy with where we are there. To your question on competitor instruments, definitely that\u2019s the second step and then there\u2019s a third step everybody and anybody who is using Empower, that probably also hits the competitor set. So there is a large installed base and anytime somebody is trying to replace an HPLC or UPLC, you should expect Waters to be in that conversation, especially and then this is especially important given that Empower is installed as the most ubiquitous CDS system. So, we are going to leverage the strength of Empower to try and make sure that we have a seat at the table virtually everywhere. The second thing that I wanted to add is from an instrument perspective. I mean, don't forget mass spec. Mass spec also has an older army of instruments that we've sold over many years, and there too, we completely renewed our Tandem Quad portfolio in 2019 and we're using that to get in and have conversations with our customers. So, that also \u2013 that probably is in your baseball analogy in the first innings and that's also started off very well. So, expect to hear more as the year progresses and we do intend to make sure that that continues and gets tracked very carefully. And the last piece on that that I'll add, this is also to a previous question on the areas we are investing in, we've been invested in basically collecting all the data that we have on the installed base, be it Empower based, be it Instrument based, and of course to automate it and to make it readily usable you have to invest in technology and that's what we're doing. I hope that gives you more color. \nOperator: And thank you. And our last question today comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys, congrats on the quarter and thanks for the questions. I guess first you made a comment in your prepared remarks on the CRO and CDMO side that your customers view you as a collaborator rather than a competitor. And just given some of the M&A we've seen in this space do you think that\u2019s a concern among customers that some of the analytical instrument providers are increasingly becoming customers, and do you see this as a competitive advantage that you can take advantage of?\nUditBatra: Yes, I mean we are definitely hearing that. I mentioned the conversations I've had with heads of CDMO organizations, this is front and center. I mean, they view us as a collaborator who they can trust with their methods, with their ideas and I think this is something that we are definitely hearing and we intend to take, we intend to service our customers accordingly. So I think you've heard right. And I mean especially, I would even argue, especially given Waters, its technical strength and unique focus on science and technology, I mean they view us as people who can help them transfer methods, get deeper into them -- deeper with them into technical conversations and are not worried about us competing or using their technology for our own purposes. So, I would say quite a benefit, but two drivers, one might be what's happening in the competitor's universe, but the other is our own reputation as a strong scientifically based organization. At this point I want to thank you for your participation and questions and on behalf of our full management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 2021 call, which we currently anticipate to hold on August 3, 2021.Thank you all.\nOperator: And thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael Silveira",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit. Good morning everyone. In the first quarter, we recorded net sales of $609 million, an increase of approximately 27% in constant currency. Currency translation increased sales growth by approximately 4% resulting in sales growth of 31% as reported. Looking at product line growth, our revenue -- our recurring revenue which represents a combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue, increased by 15% for the quarter, while instrument sales increased 45%. Chemistry revenues were up 18% for the quarter driven by strong pharma market growth and improving industrial demand. On the service side of our business revenues were up 14%. As customers continued to reopen labs and catch up on performance maintenance professional services and repair visits. As we noted on our last earnings call, reoccurring sales are impacted by five additional calendar days in the quarter, which primarily impacted service revenues. Looking ahead, compared to 2020, there is no year-over-year difference in the number of calendar days for this year's second or third quarter. However, there are six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year. Breaking first quarter operating segment sales down further, sales related to Waters Division sales grew 26%, while TA Instrument sales grew 28%. Combined LC and LC-MS instrument sales were up 47%, while TA system sales grew 34%. Now I'd like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.2%, a 350 basis point increase compared to 54.7% in the first quarter of 2020, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and favorable FX. Moving down, the first quarter P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. The increase was primarily attributed to higher labor incentive compensation cost and higher depreciation from IT investments we made over the last few years. In the first quarter our effective operating tax rate was 14%, an increase from last year as compared to the comparable period included some favorable discreet items in the prior year. Net interest expense was $7 million for the quarter, a decrease of about $3 million as anticipated on lower average outstanding debt balances. Our average share count came in at 62.6 million shares, flat with the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 99% to $2.29 in comparison to the $1.15 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.37 compared to $0.86 last year. The reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment in our balance sheet, I would like to summarize our first quarter results and activities. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures and excluding certain special items. In the first quarter of 2021 free cash flow grew 60% year-over-year to a $193 million after funding $40 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $14 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operation. In the first quarter this resulted in $0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow. Our increased free cash flow was primarily a result of sales growth and bettered operating margins compared to the prior year. In the quarter accounts receivable days sale outstanding came in at 84 days, down 15 days compared to the first quarter of last year. Inventory decreased by $16 million in comparison to the prior year quarter on higher sales volumes. Waters maintained a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well structured debt maturity profile. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares of common stock for $173 million in the first quarter. These capital allocation activities along with our free cash flow results in cash and short-term investments of $810 million and debt of $1.7 billion on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. This resulted in a net debt position of $893 million and a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about one time at the end of the first quarter. Our capital deployment priorities remain consistent; investor growth, maintain balance sheet strength and flexibility, and return capital to shareholders. We remain committed to deploying capital against these priorities and as Udit commented earlier, we have begun a new strategic planning process. As we continue to execute against our priorities, we will evaluate deploying capital to open up attractive and adjacent markets. As we look forward to the remainder of the year ahead, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2021. One, while the business environment remains subject to volatility, we are seeing good momentum in our market segment which will help us exceed the 2019 levels. Two, we believe this momentum will continue until the second quarter, but that a strong double-digit growth will mostly occur in the first half of the year due to more challenging comparisons in the second half of the year and the six fewer calendar days that we will have in the fourth quarter. Three, we continue to expect that all major geographies will perform better this year than they did in 2020, led by growth in China. Four, our near-term growth initiatives are expected to continue to ramp, led by our LC replacement initiative, which we expect to contribute increasingly through our performance. These dynamics support updated full-year 2021 guidance for cost and currency sales growth of 8% to 11%. At current rates, the positive currency translation to 2021 sales growth is expected to be approximately 1 to 2 percentage points. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be between 57.5% and 58%. Every year we look to balance growth, investment and profitability. Accordingly, we expect 2021 operating margins of between 28% to 29%, based on a combination of investments, the normalization of COVID related cost and disciplined expense controls. Moving now, below the operating income line, other key assumptions for the full year guidance are as follows. Net interest expense of $35 million to $38 million, a full-year tax rate in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%, the net impact of our share repurchase program 2021 that will result in an average diluted 2021 share count of 61.5 million to 62 million shares outstanding. Over the course of the year, we will evaluate our share repurchase program and provide quarterly update as appropriate. Drilling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2021 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $9.85 to $10.05 which assumes a positive currency impact on full-year earnings per share growth of approximately 3 percentage points. Looking at the second quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 14% to 16%. At today's rates currency translation is expected to increase second quarter sales growth by approximately 3 percentage points. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.25 as the significant prior year COVID cost savings actions start to normalize. At current rates the positive currency impact on second quarter earnings per share growth is expected to be approximately 1 percentage point. Now I'd like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Thank you for your questions. Yes, on the five additional days, it added about 3% of growth to our recurring revenues in the quarter. So from an EPS perspective, one thing to remember here is, last year with the pandemic we put in place many cost actions. For example, salaries were reduced, furloughs were put in place, spending was reduced significantly throughout the corporation. We are going to experience a huge normalization for rest of this year that will mitigate the growth of the EPS. I guess, said it another way, the kind of normalization that needs to happen this year. As far as the gross margins, this margin there was so much volume that lead to a kind of operating leverage. So that will mitigate itself the rest of the year because of that normalization that I mentioned. So, I would expect for the full year, we're going to get back for the 57.5% to 58%, but I don't expect it to be inconsistent with the past. Headwinds, that would be about a 3%. Sure, I will just add, with the strong customer demand that we're actually seeing, we have started to make the investment into the P&L, but all of our expenses haven't hit Q1 P&L. So you are going to see some increase in expense as we move to the rest of the year that catches up with these initiatives that Udit was referring to. This is a gated process and we do look at projects, one on, we do look at each of the products initiatives and spending on what it is and we navigated processes and we'll make sure it makes sense before we actually start the process. So it's - it is a gated process and we will expect not the leverage to be not as good as it was in Q1 the rest of this year."

            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Bryan, and good morning, everyone. Along with Bryan joining me on this morning's call is Mike Silveira, Water's Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim CFO. I would like to start by expressing how grateful I am to our colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment especially to those who are continuing to experience the devastating effects of the pandemic. We have not yet seen a uniformed recovery as there are still many regions around the world that are being ravaged by the pandemic. As many of you are aware, India is facing a particularly dire situation at the moment. Our colleagues and customers there are very much on our minds and we are working closely with our team in India to ensure safety of our employees and their families and we're doing all we can to support our customers. During today's call I will provide you a brief overview of our first quarter operating results as well as an update on our three-phase transformation plan focused on number one, beginning our commercial momentum; number two, further strengthening on organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. Next I will provide some thoughts on how our business is positioned to drive sustainable growth. Mike will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our updated second quarter and full-year financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Briefly reviewing our operating results for the first quarter, revenue grew 31% as reported, 27% on a constant currency basis and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share grew 99% year-over-year. This strong start to the year was driven by growth across all end markets as we saw continued strength in pharma and earlier than expected recovery in non-pharma spending by our customers, new product traction and s strong commercial execution by our team. Looking more closely at our topline results, first from a customer end market perspective, all our end markets grew double-digits during the first quarter. Our largest market category Pharma grew 28% in constant currency. Industrial grew 24% and Academic and Government grew 29%. Moving now to our sales performance by geography. On a constant currency basis, sales in Asia grew 41% with China up 109%. Sales in Americas grew 14% with the U.S. growing 13% and sales in Europe grew 25%. From an operating segment perspective, our Waters division grew 26% while DA grew by 28% on a constant currency basis. Customer activity continued to improve in the first quarter with pharma leading the way, driving better than expected trends in recurring revenues and a significant growth in instrument revenue. Recurring revenue grew 15% with Services growing 14% and Chemistry Consumables revenue growing 18%, driven by combined pharma strength and improved industrial demand. LC instruments grew across all of our major geographies and market categories with more than 40% growth. It is encouraging to see both HPLC and UPLC instrument units growth double-digits driven by pent up demand, integration of the Arc HPLC and strong execution of our LC replacement initiative. The success of the launch of the Arc HPLC in the general purpose HPLC space cannot be understated and the ACQUITY Premier has been received very well by customers since its February launch. Mass spec sales were also strong in the first quarter with growth in excess of 50% as demand in the Pharma market remained robust in addition to rebounds we saw in other markets including clinical food and environmental and biomedical research. Demand was solid for our Tandem Quads in Europe and China, particularly in Pharma and in food. Finally, to TA, revenue grew 28% as demand rebounded in the core industrial business and strength continued in pharma, medical devices and semiconductors. Growth was robust across all major geographies and product lines with particular strength in thermal and electrophoresis. Looking deeper at our sales performance by geography, all major regions grew double-digits. China built further on last quarter strength more than doubling sales year-over-year. Results were strong across all end markets as China continued its recovery from last year's COVID disruptions. Pharma was particularly strong in China driven by triple digits growth in both contract labs and traditional Chinese medicine. Our food business in China also saw meaningful growth driven by significant rebound in contract testing organizations to the level that we're above those we saw in 2018 and in 2019. This is just one quarter and not indicative of a trend, but it demonstrates that the market is recovering and our execution has improved. India sales grew double-digits for the third consecutive quarter despite worsening conditions and continued pandemic challenges throughout the country. Europe experienced broad-based strength across all customer end markets including meaningful sequential improvements in both industrial and Academic and Government markets. In the U.S., both pharma and industrial markets had strong growth in the quarter, while demand in our Academic and Government market remained soft as it lagged behind other markets and reopened. In summary, we had a great start to the year with strong year-on-year growth that was broad-based than last quarter, with impressive performance across all our regions, end markets, and product categories. Pharma demand has not subsided and many of our non-pharma markets are now in the process of recovering, which gives us greater confidence as we look to the remainder of the year. Now, I would like to talk more broadly about our business and its overall direction moving forward, including the strength of the company, the effectiveness of the markets that we serve and our deep commitment to innovation as we look beyond this quarter into the longer term. Our three-phased transformation plan is; number one, beginning our commercial momentum; number two, strengthening our organization with leadership and performance management; and number three, aligning our portfolio with growth areas. Looking at our first priority of regaining our commercial momentum, let me review some initiatives I mentioned previously. First, instrument replacements initiatives, we delivered a significant acceleration in instrument revenue growth to 45%. In February, we launched the ACQUITY Premier system augmenting the already solid placement Arc HPLC launched in June of 2020 creating new opportunities for instrument replacements. Additionally, we have gained traction with customers to replace aging Tandem Quad mass spec instruments with newer instruments. Second, as part of our CRO's CDMO expansion initiative, we've seen revenue growth accelerate to strong double-digits in both these customer segments. Customers continue to perceive us as a strong technical partner as they transfer methods from originators and they see us as a strong collaborator rather than a competitor. Third, our e-commerce initiative has begun to deliver tangible results, search engine optimization and page search have led to first impressions that are up more than 40% year-on-year. While not every click translates to immediate revenue, increasing traffic is an important first step in our e-commerce efforts. Fourth, driving launch excellence, let me start with liquid chromatography. While the Arc HPLC is a leader in general purpose HPLC space, I want to focus on the ACQUITY Premier. Last year we launched the ACQUITY Premier columns and followed that up with the ACQUITY Premier system last quarter. Though we are still in the early stages of the revenue ramp up for both, the columns and the systems saved the ACQUITY Premier columns as significantly outpacing the prior successful chemistry launches, including the original ACQUITY columns. Turning to mass spec, in 2019 we launched the BioAccord Cyclic IMS, SYNAPT XS, TQ-S cronos and a next generation version of our TQ-S micro. Pairing our Tandem Quads with ACQUITY Premier creates industry leading reproducibility and sensitivity for challenging assays. With expanding applications of the BioAccord we've maintained our focus on bringing a versatile easy to use and robust LC-MS system to the QA-QC space. During Q1 we launched workflow for peptide multi-attribute method on the new Waters connect platform to enable the monitoring of quality attributes at the peptide level. This adds to already existing simple to use applications of peptide mapping, intact subunit mass analysis, released glycan profiling and oligonucleotide mass confirmation. Over the last year we established the BioAccord into the workflows for characterizing mRNA molecules that have since become vaccines. In fact, BioNTech recognized Waters for our support of its COVID-19 vaccine development and relief efforts. Lastly, Cyclic was launched in September 2019 and is targeted at the most advanced high-resolution mass spec users. Augmenting traditional LCMS with high-resolution ion mobility allows us to separate molecules with additional, but identical molecular weight, based on their different shapes. This is now especially relevant for monitoring structural changes in the sugar pattern of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We do recognize that we still have a bit of work to do on our mass spec informatics applications and we're addressing this through the development and rollout of our Waters connect software platform across our full mass spec portfolio. Today, Waters connect support biopharma characterization and monitoring blood flows with a range of capabilities on the BioAccord Xevo QTof and [indiscernible]. And with the launch of our RDa Benchtop -- Benchtop Tof in Q1 Waters Connect also enabled small molecular flows. We are grateful to have earned the trust and partnership with our customers as we develop further applications and beta test upcoming products and software. Next on our TA Instruments division, last year we launched the X3 DSC which offers unique advantages for routine high throughput labs and R&D especially in pharma, electronics and advanced materials. The ability of the X3 DSC to deliver high sensitivity measurements of physical properties more quickly than comparable products is enabling these measurements to be more broadly deployed in manufacturing processes, where scientists can evaluate multiple combinations in parallel reducing time to market. The more time I spend with my R&D colleagues together with our customers, the more impressed I am with the strength of our deeply technical culture. Moving on to our second priority. You've already seen the planned leadership transitions we announced last month. Amol Chaubal will join us as CFO on May 12. Amol has deep experience in pharma and diagnostics and has led many transformations in his prior roles, through both organic and inorganic growth. I would like to sincerely thank Michael Silveira for his four months of service as Interim CFO. Mike will continue to serve as our corporate controller and I am pleased to add that Mike will also assume the role of chief accounting officer. Secondly, we've established a dedicated Innovation Board which I will share, that includes leaders from R&D, business development and marketing. The Innovation Board will review unmet needs in markets we serve, assess technology proof-of-concept and monitor the execution of top R&D programs. Thirdly, I'd like to thank Mike Harrington and Ian King, our SVPs of Global Markets and Global Products respectively for their decades of dedication to Waters. Though their retirements are effective July 2, they have graciously offered to serve as consultants for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. Finally, we welcome our own Jon Pratt as the leader of the Waters division, while Jianqing Bennett will succeed Jon at the DA Division. Both Jon and Jianqing have brief commercial and transformation experience and global leadership roles in fast growing markets such as molecular diagnostics and bioprocessing. I am really pleased with our new team and I look forward to introducing them to you in the coming months. That brings us to our third priority, aligning our portfolio with high growth areas. While we won't take our IR commercial execution which remains our top priority we have recently started our strategic planning process. Now I'd like to share with you some high level thoughts on where we are today. Our number one priority is to continue strengthening the core, meaning LC-MS and materials characterization instruments, informatics, service and consumables. Second, we're starting into faster growing adjacencies where we can bring our strength of managing compliant data without competing directly with our customers. These adjacencies include opportunities to increase our exposure to biologics, be it in reagents, other instrument technologies, or bioprocessing, all in accelerating LC-MS into diagnostics or other high growth markets. Lastly, we will maintain our long-standing disciplined approach to financial management, capital structure, and capital deployment as we are focused on maintaining a top tier ROIC. Over the coming year, I look forward to sharing more with you on our strategy as well as the data points that give us confidence that we have the foundation in place to sustainability grow in this attractive market. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Mike Silveira for a deeper review of the first quarter financials and our outlook for the remainder of 2021. Mike? Thank you, Mike. In summary, there is much to be pleased about with our first quarter results driven by strong growth across each of the major end markets with Pharma leading the way. Thanks to solid execution and double-digit growth in instrument sales, we saw broad-based revenue growth across every region, with China sales more than doubling. Our transformation plan is well underway with commercial momentum and a strong leadership team in place. We now turn towards developing a new strategy as we work more closely to align our portfolio with higher growth areas of the market. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? Firstly, thanks Dan and good morning. Look, we are very pleased with the first quarter, and as we look at the rest of the year, I mean as Mike also mentioned, the pandemic is still ongoing, that's the first consideration. Second we saw pent up demand we released in Q1 which had five extra days, so that grew our base quite nicely. And the second half has a higher comp which makes us prudent as we guide towards the full year. Now of course, if our initiatives continue to do what they're doing and we see good execution there, and the other end markets continue to improve, we would be on the higher end of that guidance. So I think to me it's a prudent or to use another word, wise guidance, which basically takes these factors into account. Sure. I think first on new products. I'm very excited about our whole portfolio across LC, across mass spec, across informatics. In terms of overall quantitation, I mean I think as we look at the contribution, it's probably 2% to 3%, is it a bit higher or bit lower, I think you would have to do very sophisticated math, but it's 2% to 3% contribution. And that's quite impressive, especially on the LC side given the launch has just took place, right? So for Arc HPLC, it was launched only in June of last year, smack in the middle of the pandemic and that has had great uptake especially in China for general purpose HPLC. And then that ACQUITY Premier, the columns were launched last year and we saw, I would say absolutely terrific uptake, in fact better than the ACQUITY launched originally. And then finally, as I look at the mass spec growth, I mean our replacement initiative is doing well, especially with the launch of our renewed Tandem Quad portfolio. So, really lot to be excited about on the new products side. Yes, absolutely, I mean super happy with China, especially given the pandemic is still not over and our colleagues have really done a great job of implementing our initiatives, and some of that is contributing to the growth. I mean it's terrific growth across all segments, especially Pharma which doubled and then you saw Industrial also grew very nicely. And Academic and Government was in the mid 70%. Right? So, with that said, what I would argue is Pharma is continuing to show strength. Industrial is also starting to get stronger especially in the TA business. Academic and Government on a stack basis still has some work to do. Right? So, we still want to make sure that we focus on it as the market recovers. And then I look at the portfolio side, Instruments grew very nicely, as you again saw from the prepared remarks. And the consumables portion of the business was in the mid-40s in terms of percentage growth. Look, as I look at our -- the implementation of our initiatives that I mentioned earlier, they are contributing nicely. We singled out the Food market in the past for commentary when we talked about transformations, so let me just comment on that. We saw incredible growth in the contract testing market for Food both in the Government segment and with new customers. Right? Remember I spoke about that when we talked about the transformation plan. And with the CDMO segment some of our best performance is in China. And then finally I have a lot to thank in terms of our leadership in China. We have a new leader in China and really has renewed focus on growth. That said, I would caution against taking two data points of recovery and saying that we have completely turned the business. We still remained focused, but I'm very happy with the start. I didn't answer your question for the full year, full year I think no reason to expect anything less than high-teens in China and that would be a very good stacked growth as well versus last year. Yes, yes, so Tycho, excellent point. I mean and then I think there are many things to be happy about on the Instrument side, right? I mean if we place more Instruments, we get more consumables and more service down the line and we saw a very nice recovery. It is a mix of everything. Right? So, we saw a recovery front, seeing continued strength in Pharma, but we also saw a nice recovery in Industrials and also in Academia. In terms of the contribution, our initiatives have been doing extremely well. Our LC replacement initiative and now we have added the mass spec initiative as well, is doing super well. And that is now being helped by the launch of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier which are allowing us to focus both on the general purpose segment, but also on the UPLC segment. So, it's very difficult to extract how much is coming from -- going and finding only replacement and then how much is coming from the new products that are actually helping that conversation. So, really added together it's a very good performance. And then also from a stacked comp basis it's looking very good as you've already commented. I mean LC is doing very nicely on a -- from a 29 basis -- from a 2019 basis and mass spec is almost double digits on that front. So, really very happy with what we've been able to do on -- do with our initiatives. And then finally on the CRO, CDMO area, I mean we have had incredible impact. Last Friday I was with -- incredible conversations with CDMOs, especially last Friday I was with the CEO of one of the leading CDMOs and they perceive us as very strong partners to help them transfer methods for complex molecules. And this is something that has come more and more to the front and center globally as we talk to many of these customers. Of course, I mean they are focused on cost, but even more importantly they are focused on transferring these methods from originators. So, I think the initiatives are doing well, but there's a lot more to do there. We've just, I mean I would say in terms of penetration of our Instrument space, we are 30% along the way on mass spec. I would say we are about slightly more than that on the LC side. So we still have fertile ground there to see more growth. Yes, I think Tycho that question came up last time as well. We don't think of R&D in percentage terms and being an engineer myself and now surrounded by people in the Innovation Board we really look at the quality of the ideas. And if the quality of the ideas are good and we see a market opportunity, we will invest behind it. So, let me give you an example. As LC-MS or Diagnostics, right, so we work very closely with the UK Government on the COVID Moonshot program and we were able to develop LC-MS for as a diagnostic tool for detecting pathogens. This is now going to be submitted as an RUO later, mid this year or later this year for research is only, at least initially, but we see incredible traction in that area and we are investing behind it. So, those are the kinds of examples that come to the Innovation Board and if we see room to invest, we will. Second type of ideas where we invest our platforms, right? So, I already mentioned from a commercial perspective e-Commerce, but also taking the disparate data that exists in the organization and putting them into a data lake. Right? So, I would be loathed to tell you hey, you know, this is the ratio that we're trying to manage. Of course it's a cost conscious organization as you know from the past. We will not do silly things. At the same time if we see good ideas that have good basis, we will invest behind them. So, I hope that's satisfactory. Let me comment on India and then I let Mike comment on the contribution of the extra days. Look, I mean our heart goes out to everybody who is going through the pandemic in India. We have still seen our customers as you can imagine continue to produce small molecules and large molecules to address the challenges of the pandemic. And so our sales are tracking that and we are very heavily focused on the LC market in India, which is still the method of choice to release small molecules that India continues to produce. So, we're seeing very good growth, very good access for our service engineers despite the pandemic. I do expect it to be bumpy, but the underlying demand as we look at the full year I would expect to continue to rise. Mike, on the extra days? Yes, I think Vijay you answered your own question. It's actually prudent guidance. I mean given that the pandemic is still not over, there was a bit of pent up demand that came also from last year into Q1, not a pull forward from Q2. And then finally, I mean our initiatives are ongoing. They have shown incredible traction. We're very happy with what's happening. However, I think they still are getting traction. Right? I mean despite the pandemic we have seen good traction for our LC initiative. We are seeing good traction for e-Commerce where the page views have increased quite dramatically. We have seen good traction in reaching out to new customers. But two data points don't make a full trend. So, we're just being wise to use another word. I think that would be the answer. Mike, go ahead on the EPS. Sure. I think look it's virtually all of the above, but that said, but let's start with especially for LC, I mean we have the focus on solutions for our customers, and as we go in the new products definitely helps. Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premiere, especially help in having the conversation. Anything when we started the program first with our own installed base, then looking at the competitor installed base and the third step would be to look at everybody and anybody who is using Empower. Right? So, it's a pretty large pool and we have just, I would say one-third of the way with our own instruments in terms of getting that replacement cycle done. So, there's a lot of room there. That said, the conversation is more straightforward if you have new products, especially the Arc HPLC, as well the ACQUITY Premier. And then finally, given our reputation as a solid service company and our service engineers absolutely help. So, I think the answer is and your question, it's all of the above. For mass spec also, we've also launched a similar program and there the success rates are absolutely terrific. We're going after our own installed base from a Tandem Quad perspective and replacing the older instruments with the newer generation of Tandem Quads that were introduced in 2019. So nice progress. Some of it is the market, but I think a significant amount is renewed focus on the replacement cycle of older instruments and finding [ph] products and a broader value proposition. As far as pricing and bundling, except the pricing is concerned, we have not had to use heck of a lot of pricing to make this happen. People trust the quality that Waters brings and the innovation that we're bringing to them to solve these problems. All of the above. Right? So, we will have organic initiatives. We will have partnership opportunities and we will look at inorganic options as well. Right? so, all of the above. From an organic standpoint, I can give you examples. We think the electrodiagnostics space is interesting and LC-MS is ripe to get into that space. We have made really serious progress in working closely with many academics in the UK and the NHS, to take LC-MS into their diagnostics space for pathogens with COVID-19. We also worked with folks in Sweden on the same topic and we will introduce LC-MS as a research use only technique rather in the near future. So, organically we see tremendous opportunity as well. And another example would be entering bioprocessing. We are looking at partnerships with the leading academic institutions and many of our partners to take LC-MS into the bioprocessing suite and not just leave it in the QA-QC space where we still have room to grow. And then finally on inorganic, inorganic areas we are looking at that very, very carefully and they'll be more to say about it as time progresses, so all of the above. Excellent question Doug. Look first on the other two end markets, Industrial and Academic and Government, I think you rightly note that it is one quarter and we are seeing a nice rebound. And I'm cautious here. Right? So we're seeing good conversations with our customers about the industrial end markets are disconnect. Right? I mean, they go from polymers to semiconductors and other areas which inherently are cyclical. They are seeing good demand for hardware, especially on the TA side, but that I would say is one quarter, we're seeing good conversations, I would not start to immediately extrapolate and this is why we are a little cautious on or prudent on the guidance. On the stack growth basis, when you look at specific regions, I mean China is almost 20%, Europe is in the mid-teens in Industrial and the U.S. is mid-single-digits. So even on a stack basis this is a good performance on the Industrial end market, but largely driven by a lot of hardware spend. Now on Academic and Government, which is also the cyclical, I know you were not asking in particular, but I will take the opportunity to comment on this. Already, we saw very good growth, I mean, 29% growth overall largely driven by what we saw in China and Europe continued its strength, also 70% growth. The U.S. is still spotting and recovering. On a stacked basis, there's still work to do on China and the U.S. I mean both are still not positive versus 2019, Europe is. So I think Industrial, a little bit more confidence in the overall trend, but Academic and Government we're seeing slow return back into the different labs, more so in Europe, definitely in China but still a bit of hill to climb and Europe is 40 up and U.S. is 40 across the country. If I move to your guidance question, I will firstly give a qualitative remark and then Mike can comment on the numbers as well. We're not holding back any investment Doug. I mean, in fact, if you look at how much we have approved in terms of operating investment it's fairly significant in Q1 to start, to support our initiatives that we already mentioned. So expanding our field force in contract testing, having more informatics folks to build up Waters, Waters Connect even further and to invest behind our R&D programs, I mentioned LC-MS already and there are several others. It's just a question of the recruiting cycle taking a bit of time and people finding the right people and getting them into the system. So, really not holding back there at all. Mike, do you want to comment on the numbers? And then I think one closing remark on that Doug, just reminding you how we talked about the transformations and we said look we want to get our top line growth back first. This is such a gate business and such a good install based, there's tons of leverage in the P&L that allows us to invest without any dilution. And you're seeing the sustainability of the business as we recover our topline, and it's not just towards this last year Q1, it's also on a stack basis across many different segments and geographies. Brandon, thank you. From an e-commerce, basically just search engine optimization and paid search we saw a 45% increase according to our own numbers and I know you look at it independently as well on the number eye balls coming on to our site. It's very difficult to translate that, as you know, into the exact impact on revenues, so I won't attempt that, but you can imagine the largest impact is on the consumable side. And especially, with newer products it's worked out extremely well having the ability to drive more people onto the channel and find out more information, leading to purchase and a great uptake for our ACQUITY Premier launch. Now, in terms of the overall plan for e-commerce, I mean this is just a start. Right? So, remember I had said early on that we want to take the hand we have and do the best we can with it at the beginning as we make our plans to revitalize our platforms and I mentioned a couple of those investments in the previous question as well. So we do believe that investing in a data lake that takes all unstructured and structured data from different parts of the organization and putting that into an easily accessible middle layer will help us service our e-commerce customers better. We do believe investing in content even more is going to lead to better conversion on the e-commerce channel. We do believe investing in mobile is going to lead to a better conversion. So, you can see that there are some infrastructural investments that we have started to look at and as the organization becomes stronger and stronger, you'll start to see us invest in those. So the e-commerce plan as of few phases is the first one was just to get the quick wins and we're not done with that yet that's just the start. And there is a long term plan that will build a world class e-commerce platform for Waters. Hope that helped. Patrick, you know that I won't take that, I won't talk too much about the size and the exact ideas and the exact domains. I mean in general, you can assume that the part of the market we're in is a good mid-single-digit grower. I mean we have a bit of catch up to do, so you'll see us doing better than that in the short to midterm given the initiatives we've put in place, and the market share we've had to, we want to climb back and gain. Right? So, I think that will be the first lift. As you look at the adjacencies there are ones that fundamentally go faster like molecular diagnostics, like bioprocessing and bioreagents and we are looking at each of those categories to see how we can organically enter those, how we can do partnerships and also looking at inorganic ideas. I mean, the process has begun and you'll hear more about it as we progress further with concrete ideas. Yes, thanks. I'm sure of picking it up Josh. Look, LC, the 8000 number was HPLC and UPLC only and especially on the Waters Instrument. And when you talk about innings, if you're talking about baseball, probably we are in the third inning. There's a lot more work to do and lot more to pick up there. And we haven't done that in past. We haven't replaced our own instruments. So, I mean we are going in and it's working out super well, especially with the new products being available as well and both on the HPLC side and the UPLC side. So, we're very happy with where we are there. To your question on competitor instruments, definitely that's the second step and then there's a third step everybody and anybody who is using Empower, that probably also hits the competitor set. So there is a large installed base and anytime somebody is trying to replace an HPLC or UPLC, you should expect Waters to be in that conversation, especially and then this is especially important given that Empower is installed as the most ubiquitous CDS system. So, we are going to leverage the strength of Empower to try and make sure that we have a seat at the table virtually everywhere. The second thing that I wanted to add is from an instrument perspective. I mean, don't forget mass spec. Mass spec also has an older army of instruments that we've sold over many years, and there too, we completely renewed our Tandem Quad portfolio in 2019 and we're using that to get in and have conversations with our customers. So, that also \u2013 that probably is in your baseball analogy in the first innings and that's also started off very well. So, expect to hear more as the year progresses and we do intend to make sure that that continues and gets tracked very carefully. And the last piece on that that I'll add, this is also to a previous question on the areas we are investing in, we've been invested in basically collecting all the data that we have on the installed base, be it Empower based, be it Instrument based, and of course to automate it and to make it readily usable you have to invest in technology and that's what we're doing. I hope that gives you more color. Yes, I mean we are definitely hearing that. I mentioned the conversations I've had with heads of CDMO organizations, this is front and center. I mean, they view us as a collaborator who they can trust with their methods, with their ideas and I think this is something that we are definitely hearing and we intend to take, we intend to service our customers accordingly. So I think you've heard right. And I mean especially, I would even argue, especially given Waters, its technical strength and unique focus on science and technology, I mean they view us as people who can help them transfer methods, get deeper into them -- deeper with them into technical conversations and are not worried about us competing or using their technology for our own purposes. So, I would say quite a benefit, but two drivers, one might be what's happening in the competitor's universe, but the other is our own reputation as a strong scientifically based organization. At this point I want to thank you for your participation and questions and on behalf of our full management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. We look forward to updating you on our progress during our Q2 2021 call, which we currently anticipate to hold on August 3, 2021.Thank you all."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Udit Batra. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving in, I would like to extend our thoughts and our prayers to the thousands of those who are affected in Turkey and Syria by the earthquakes. Today marks a major milestone in accelerating value creation for our customers and shareholders as we progress to the next step in the execution of our strategy. This morning, we made the exciting announcement that Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering will be joining forces with Waters, bringing with it a fast growing, attractive business with key capabilities to accelerate our 1.8 billion double-digit growth opportunity in Bioprocess Characterization. More than 40 years ago, Wyatt was the first commercialized light scattering instruments incorporating lasers as their light source. Ever since they've defined and redefined state-of-the-art light scattering instrumentation, software, and services. Along the way, we've also added several related technologies including dynamic light scattering, viscometry, refractometry, and field-flow fractionation. Together, the innovative products are used to determine the properties of novel therapeutics such as cell and gene therapy, vaccines, and proteins, as well as synthetic polymers and nanoparticles. Wyatt was the top asset and priority we identified for bioanalytical characterization, making the acquisition a significant step forward in this high growth adjacency. I would like to take this opportunity to invite Geof and Cliff to say a few words about this exciting combination. Geof?\nGeof Wyatt : Thank you, Udit. We are thrilled to be with you here today at this incredible moment for our company. For over four decades, Wyatt Technology has delighted customers with industry leading innovation in light scattering, characterizing life enhancing large molecule therapeutics. Our common scientific heritage deep mutual respect for science-based innovation and a passion for customer success makes Waters the ideal steward to propel our family legacy into its next chapter. Now Cliff, would you like to add anything?\nCliff Wyatt: Sure. Thank you, Geoff. I would like to echo your comments and also [my father's] [ph] Dr. Wyatt\u2019s sentiment that we could not have been more excited, but could not be more excited about this combination. Waters will broaden Wyatt global reach scale and will accelerate deployment of light scattering technologies in downstream and QA/QC spaces, integrating this technology onto Waters' well-established empowered platform. Waters is such a natural and logical fit for us in this next exciting chapter of Wyatt\u2019s history.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Geoff, and thank you, Cliff. We are honored to get this unique opportunity to carry Wyatt forward into the future. This combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other. And as you highlighted Geoff, our shared deep scientific culture and common passion for customer success will accelerate integration and drive value creation for our customers and shareholders in the years to come. Today, Waters has a strong and growing portfolio serving large molecule separation and characterization, which are approximately 30% of our pharmaceutical revenues. These applications serve high volume downstream workflows in biologic development and QA/QC Central Labs using LC-UV and LC-MS. Wyatt\u2019s significant exposure to the very fast growing biologic applications will build on this presence and will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecules, including gene therapy and viral vectors. For Wyatt, as Cliff mentioned, this combination will provide expanded geographic reach and will accelerate the adoption of light scattering and downstream applications through our established presence and empowered informatics platform. As you can tell, we're excited to share more details about the strategic benefits of this combination. However, this is our fourth quarter and our full-year earnings call, and we have some excellent results to share with you first. So now, I will cover our key messages and financial results for the core business. Then we will continue outlining the value of this combination as we take this next step in the evolution of our strategy. Looking at our financial results, we ended another very successful year delivering strong results in the fourth quarter with growth across our end markets. This was led by yet another outstanding double-digit instrument growth quarter. Our incredible performance this year would not have been possible without our dedicated and talented colleagues. We overcame numerous macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges throughout 2022, including global supply chain challenges, COVID lockdowns, inflationary pressures, and currency headwinds, all while responding to high customer demands for our products. Today, we have three key messages, which reflect the strength in our core business and the exciting future that lies ahead. First, we continue to deliver consistently strong execution. You can see this in our 2022 performance where we sustained strong growth after a stellar year in 2021. You can also see this in our three-year CAGR of approximately 9% in constant currency, where our results have placed us amongst the top players in the industry since the beginning of our transformation. Second, our revitalized portfolio has contributed to our growth and we expect this to continue. New products have resulted in growth opportunities in large molecules, applications, PFAs and battery testing, while supporting strong [core] [ph] instrument replacement. Third, while we have accomplished a lot in the past 2.5 years, we are now augmenting our organic efforts with M&A to accelerate our journey into high growth adjacencies. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 3% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and regions with robust customer demand. Industrial was again our fastest growing end market, up 14% led by environmental testing, which grew over 20%; and TA, which grew mid-teens. Pharma saw continued robust growth, up 6% with strength in both small and large molecule applications. Strength was set by Europe, which grew low double digits, offset by headwinds in China. Academic and government grew 8% as in increased activity and funding resulted in strong year-end spending in several of our geographies. Instruments grew double-digits net by mass spec. New products contributed across our portfolio with Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier, and cyclic unit sales growing over 40% percent. Meanwhile, our newest instrument launches Xevo TQ Absolute, and Xevo G3 saw excellent continued traction with very strong demand. Recurring revenues grew high single digits supported by our e-commerce and service attachment growth initiatives. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.84. This is up 5% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 8%. For the full-year, revenue grew 7% as reported and 12% in constant currency. 2022 was a very strong year for Waters where we executed well throughout the organization against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our growth was broad-based across our geographies and end markets. Each of which grew low-double-digits or above. This strength was led by instrument sales, which grew 16% for the year with LC, mass spec, and [TA Systems] [ph] all growing double-digits. For the full-year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $12.02. This is up 7% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 9%. Now, as we enter 2023, our end markets remain robust and healthy with strong customer demand for our products. These attractive end markets [indiscernible] growth drivers and are well funded. We saw solid auto growth in the fourth quarter and our backlog remains at elevated levels. We expect the strong instrument sales we saw in 2022 to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. So, our end markets are healthy. We've regained our commercial momentum. Innovation has been revitalized and we have strengthened our organization with new leadership capabilities, bringing a proven track record in transformation. Now, we're entering the next phase of our execution strategy as we accelerate our path toward faster growth. This brings us now to the chart on the next slide. As you can see, biologics manufacturing is a complex process and we have shared an example which shows how large scale monoclonal antibodies are produced. It starts with the upstream production of the drug substance where the raw material components are fingerprinted and monitored during initial cell culture creation before the protein or antibody of choice is produced. Then in downstream manufacturing, cells and debris are separated from the [indiscernible] in a series of filtration and separation steps. Each step involves numerous stages of testing to ensure that the product is stable and effective. Then as a last step, in QA/QC, the final purified drug product is formulated and filled in vials of prefilled syringes. Throughout the process, different tools and technologies are required for characterization, depending upon what you need to analyze liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or LC-UV is used extensively across all four stages. At the same time, mass spec is increasingly being used with BioAccord seeing a lot of traction in cell culture media characterization, clone selection and process optimization in both upstream and downstream manufacturing. It is also seeing adoption in QA/QC applications. We shared details on this at the beginning of the year and have included a slide in the appendix. In addition to LC-UV and LC-MS, powerful techniques such as dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering are also used to give relevant information about the size, molecular weight, and aggregation of biologics by combining the data from each of these detectors our customers can develop a more comprehensive profile of their biologics. This is essential to speeding up the manufacturing process and reducing the cost of complex biologics such as cell and gene therapies. The bioanalytical characterization market is around 1.8 billion growing around 10% to 12%. Waters already has a strong established position in LC-UV and LC mass spec, whereas Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in light scattering. Hence this combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other and will accelerate our journey in this opportunity. Let me now ask Geof to describe the company and its highly innovative portfolio. Geoff? \nGeof Wyatt: Thanks again, Udit. Well, Wyatt is a remarkable company and we owe much of its success in high growth applications to our amazing team. Our flagship technology is multi-angle light scattering MALS, which is used by leading biopharma, biotech, and academic institutions to measure fundamental properties of complex biologics, including cell and gene therapies, mRNA vaccines, biopolymers, biosimilars, and therapeutic protein. We're based here in Santa Barbara, California and have 225 outstanding employees of whom roughly 25% have Ph.D.\u2019s. Over the past 40 years, we've built Wyatt into the recognized leader in light scattering detection, defining the segment very much like Waters did for liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Our sales have grown around 20% on a three-year CAGR to approximately $110 million in 2022. We're also a highly profitable business with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 40%. More than 80% of our revenues are in large molecule applications. Our biopharma customers are eager to use light scattering for QA/QC applications and have been keen for us to combine our software with Empower. So, you can only imagine how excited we are with this combination, which will add additional choices and capabilities for our existing customers and let us delight even more. Back to you, Udit.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Geoff. I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Waters. Let's now talk about some of the benefits that integrating Wyatt and Waters\u2019 capabilities that provide for our customers. In our existing Waters portfolio, our [LC system] [ph] separate complex mixtures into individual constituents for both property analysis by UV and detailed characterization by mass spec. These are properties such as titer aggregation and protein sequence. A missing piece has been additional critical information about the intact molecule, like the Empty/Full capsid ratio of adeno associated viruses or the size of lipid nano particles or mRNA therapies. These will be augmented by Wyatt\u2019s MALS detectors, which will allow our customers to develop a more comprehensive critical quality attribute profile for their biologics. This is essential to fully characterizing their manufacturing process. In each case for these tools to gain successful adoption in point of view settings, they must be: Number 1, sophisticated, but simple for use in high volume applications, such as what we've already demonstrated with BioAccord; Number 2, supported by leading service like Waters already has to help run workflows and respond to evolving needs; And Number 3, and most importantly, they need to be connected to a common informatics platform so that all the data comes together in one place. Our ambition is to create an ecosystem of sophisticated, yet simple instruments that can all use Empower to collect data and submit to regulators. No differently than what Waters established for small molecules years ago. This transaction will create a number of compelling revenue synergies and results in an attractive set of pro-forma financials. First, from a geographic footprint, Waters revenues are highly diversified, whereas Wyatt\u2019s presence is concentrated in the United States. This provides us an opportunity to expand Wyatt\u2019s geographic footprint in Europe and Asia, particularly in China. Second, HPLC instruments and size exclusion chemistry columns are sold together with light scattering instruments. We expect to see cross-selling synergies with our liquid chromatography instruments and chemistry. Third, Wyatt\u2019s instruments and expertise will enable Waters to meaningfully accelerate the high growth adjacency opportunity in bioanalytical characterization. This will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecule applications and will augment our ability to create a comprehensive bioanalytical platform. And fourth, Wyatt\u2019s portfolio is well-established in upstream development settings for large molecule applications today. Waters\u2019 Empower platform, as well as our presence and expertise in high volume down-stream recurring applications will accelerate the use of light scattering and biologics manufacturing and in QA/QC. Now, to the pro-forma. The combination will increase our large molecule footprint to around 35% of our pharmaceutical revenues. Our increased exposure to these faster growing markets will raise the combined growth profile of the markets we serve by at least 50 basis points. We expect the transaction to contribute more than 60 basis points to our annualized constant currency growth over the next five years. We also expect it to add more than 50 basis points to our industry leading adjusted operating margin. Net, we expect to realize a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five, although we expect the Wyatt business to grow low-double-digits in the near-to-mid-term. In addition, we expect this combination to create more than 70 million in annualized revenue synergies by year five. Now, I would like to pass the call to Amol to walk us through further details on the financings. He will then continue covering our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2023. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. It's been great to work with Geoff, Cliff, and the entire team at Wyatt Technology. Like Udit, I'm very thankful to the Wyatt family for considering us as the rightful stewards of their mission and legacy and for providing us this opportunity to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now, to the transaction highlights. This 1.36 billion investment will result in immediate accretion of our revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin percentage. The synergies that Udit just described, along with Wyatt\u2019s highly attractive financials, are expected to result in accretive non-GAAP EPS impact as early as first quarter of 2024. Altogether, as Udit mentioned, this combination is expected to deliver a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five. We will fund this investment through cash on our balance sheet and existing debt capacity that is available on our revolver. On day one, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.3. We will temporarily suspend our share buyback program for the remainder of 2023 and will utilize our free cash flow to pay down the debt through the rest of the year. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to land at around 1.7 by year-end 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Now, to our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered an excellent close to a very strong year for Waters with constant currency growth of 9%. Waters division grew 8%, and TA grew 15%. By end market, pharma grew 6%, Industrial grew 14%, and academic and government grew 8%, which Udit already covered. By geography, sales in Asia grew 7%, Americas grew 8%, and Europe grew 11%. In Asia, growth in region overall was strong. Japan grew 25% and India grew 15%. China declined low single digits for the quarter, as a sharp increase in COVID infections at year-end resulted in delayed spending due to customer site closures. We expect these headwinds from the post-zero COVID reopening to continue into the first quarter of 2023 before catching up throughout the remainder of the year. In other regions, the U.S. grew 8% and Europe grew 11% with broad strength across end-markets. By products and services, instruments grew 10%, led by mass spec, which grew over 30%. Recurring revenues grew 7% with chemistry up 8%, and service up 7%. Finally, TA grew 15% with double-digit growth across our major geographies. Growth was led by sales in electronics, and battery applications, as well as strong growth in advanced materials and chemical testing. Looking now at our full-year results. By end market, pharma grew 10%, industrial grew 15%, and academic and government grew 13%. In pharma, growth was led by large molecule applications, which grew mid-teens, while small molecule grew high-single-digits. By geography, sales in Asia grew 12%. Americas grew 14%, and Europe grew 10%. By products and services, instruments grew 16% for the full-year with liquid chromatography, mass spec, and TA system sales all up double-digits. In our recurring revenues, chemistry grew 9% supported by our strong launch of MAX peak premier columns in large molecule applications and further expansion in digital commerce adoption. Service grew 8% with continued expansion in attachment rates, which increased 150 basis points in 2022 and have increased 350 basis points since 2019. Now, I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.4%, up 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by sales volume and pricing, partially offset by inflationary costs. For the full-year, gross margin came in as expected at 58%. Operating margin for the quarter was 33.7%, growth of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin dynamics. For the full-year, operating margin was approximately 30.2%, which was flat with last year. On an underlying basis, we expanded our operating margins by approximately 100 basis points versus our guide of 20 basis points to 30 basis points at the beginning of the year. This is net of our investments in higher growth adjacencies and despite the higher instrument mix in our revenue. On an as reported basis, our expansion was offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds and 20 basis points of additional compensation to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 17.6% and for the full-year it was 15.6%. For the full-year as anticipated, our effective tax rate increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to change regarding the capitalization of R&D costs. Average share count came in at 59.6 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $3.84, compared with $3.67 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings for fully diluted share was $3.81. For the full-year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share increased 7% to $12.02, versus $11.20 in the prior year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 9%. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share was $11.73. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, free cash flow was 145 million after funding 62 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from this free cash flow was $8 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. In the quarter, we continued to build inventory to secure supply and build safety stock, given strong instrument demand. For the full-year, free cash flow was 506 million after funding 176 million of capital expenditures and includes approximately 100 million of additional inventory versus the prior year-end. Excluded from the free cash flow, was 32 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a 38 million tax reform payment. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This trend allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, which will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive adjacent markets. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of our common stock for 149 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately 1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1. Now, as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2023. We have seen strong performance throughout 20 22, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across our geographies, and new product introductions driving growth. As we enter 2023, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid in our durable end markets and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. These dynamic support of full-year 20 23 guidance of organic constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, excluding Wyatt. At current rates, negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point resulting in full-year reported organic sales growth guidance of 4% to 5.5%. We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, and depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full-year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is 6% to 8.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt. For the full-year 2023, organic gross margin is expected to be approximately 58% and organic operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Before FX, this includes 20 basis points to 30 basis points of net margin expansion after 70 basis points to 80 basis points of investment in high growth adjacencies. FX is expected to be a headwind of 50 basis points, particularly in the first half of the year. The addition of Wyatt in Q2 is expected to be accretive to our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Excluding the transaction, we expect our full-year net interest expense to be approximately 42 million. The transaction is expected to add 27 million to 43 million of additional interest expense, depending on the timing of the close. The full-year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Since we will be temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year and using free cash flow to pay down debt, our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full-year 2023 earnings for fully diluted share guidance, excluding the transaction is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90. This represents 6% to 7% growth versus last year and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. The Wyatt transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS, as early as in the first quarter of 2024. And this is even net of our share buyback suspension for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we expect it to deliver a high single digit plus adjusted return on invested capital, net of tax by year five. Due to interest expense incurred on higher debt balance, and the suspension of share repurchase program this year, the transaction is expected to result in a 2023 EPS headwind of approximately $0.15. Hence, including Wyatt, non-GAAP full-year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a two-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 with a negative currency impact of approximately 6 percentage points. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol, as I outlined at the beginning of our transformation journey and later at our Investor Day last year, our first focus was to regain our commercial momentum and strengthen our organization with new leadership capabilities. As you have observed over the last 2.5 years, we have delivered incredible results with consistently strong execution, and we have assembled an amazing leadership team that brings with it a proven track record in transformation, which is pivotal to driving seamless integration. Our second focus was to revitalize our portfolio. The success of our new product launches, the increased vitality index of our portfolio, and the rich pipeline ahead of us underscores our accomplishments this year. Today, we're entering our next phase, which is to accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders by adding a fantastic fast growing technology platform. And increasing our capabilities to address high growth adjacent markets. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor : Thank you, Udit. That concludes our formal comments and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Your line is open.\nLuke Sergott: Hi guys. Thanks for the question here. So, I guess, before we get into Wyatt, can you kind of give us a sense on continued instrument strength you guys hear it a lot? Your visibility here, how the backlog built, mass back up over 30%, that's from the strength in the business building here the last six months. Any kind of color here we can get going forward on that \u2013 on the new instrument launches there in the revitalization?\nUdit Batra: Sure. Sure, Luke. Thank you for the question. So, instrument growth in the quarter, again, finished with double-digit instrument growth. For the year, it's 16%. And it's really across the board, right? For the full-year, you see mass spec well into the [20s] [ph], TA in the high-teens, LC also in the double-digit range. And this is largely due to the success of our commercial initiatives, which were around instrument replacement and really focusing on our new product launches.  And there you've seen a complete revitalization of the portfolio, especially on the mass spec side, where we've gained traction in biologics application with the Xevo G3 with the BioAccord more recently with the cyclic and [indiscernible] absolute for food and environmental applications [on the light] [ph]. On the LC side, same thing with Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier. So, you see very strong new products coming through, which are gaining traction. Now, as we look ahead, I mean, orders are as strong as ever. We see a very, very healthy backlog going into the year. And as we look forward, the end markets are still very robust, right. So, we don't expect \u2013 and across the board, they are pretty robust, in industrial pharma itself, as well as academic with additional funding, but as we look ahead, I would caution against using the 16% and extrapolating. I think we've been saying this for a while, these are incredible growth numbers.  On a stacked basis, you're looking at double-digit growth for instruments, but we cannot expect the instrument growth to continue at a double-digit level. I mean the long-term average is around 3% to 4%. And if I were to just dig into the guide a little bit, when we say 5% to 6.5%, so the 5% \u2013 if you just take the higher-end and then make it consistent, let's say, with the recurring revenues and the lower-end consistent with the instrument growth in the future, long-term averages for instrument growth are between 3% and 4%. Add 100 basis points of additional commercial execution and another 100 basis points for pricing, and there you have the 5%-ish instrument growth. So, we think it \u2013 long term, we should be seeing healthy instrument growth. And I've heard several comments which say, \u2018hey, you've seen serious significant instrument growth, will it come crashing down?\u2019 Not at all. We don't see any signs of that. We do see it reverting back to, sort of long-term growth averages, and we think we will out-execute the overall market growth with our commercial initiatives, with our new products and with additional pricing.\nLuke Sergott: All right. Great. Just a quick follow-up on that. Can you clarify if orders grew faster than sales? And then I'd love to dig in on Wyatt where \u2013 so where that fits into the overall characterization portfolio? So, you have the BioAccord on the raw materials on the upstream, where would Wyatt's light scattering technologies, kind of fit into the overall instrument portfolio and the bioprocessing workflow?\nUdit Batra: This is a fantastic question. So, the orders are growing very nicely, Luke. And we've been saying that for a while, and they continue to do so. Now, moving on to Wyatt, look, it's a perfect strategic fit. We've been talking about bioanalytical characterization, a 1.8 billion market, growing 10% to 12%. And Wyatt a 110 million, I mean, there are hardly many companies that are accretive to us in the industry on margins, 40% margins and growing at a 20%-ish CAGR, right? So, terrific, terrific financial profile. When you look at the bioanalytical space, and you talk about LC-UV and LC-mass spec, LC-UV and mass spec are used to characterize the sequence of the proteins, the configuration of the proteins, the chemical composition, right. There are exquisite techniques to characterize the composition of the molecules and the composition of raw materials, upstream, downstream process development, and of course, in QA/QC. Light scattering, on the other hand, gives you biophysical characterization, the size of the molecule, the level of aggregation of the molecule, think about monoclonal antibodies and proteins. And even more exciting these days is what it does for us in viral vector therapies, empty versus full [indiscernible], right. Light scattering allows you to get at that lipid nanoparticles, how aggregated they are, how well characterized, how full they are with mRNA molecules. Super exciting applications. And our customers, and Geof and Cliff tell me, have been asking us \u2013 or their customers have been asking us to integrate it with a compliant software platform so they can use it in QA/QC applications. It's already used by a significant number of large pharma players as an at-line testing tool. So, super excited, highly complementary. It gives you even a better footprint of biologics. And our dream is \u2013 and our ambition is to make large molecule characterization similar to small molecule characterization as we've done in the past.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on the transaction. And I had two questions. Udit, first maybe on the guidance here. The 5% to 6.5% guide for the year, what is that resuming for pricing and China outlook? And I thought FX headwinds came down. Why is FX a margin headwind?\nUdit Batra: So, I'll comment a bit on China first and what we expect there, and I'll pass it on to Amol to take it up from there. Look, Q4 in China, I mean, has been especially tough with 50% to 75% of our colleagues, at any point in time, being infected due to the reopening. And despite that, if you take from November last year, we had a shipment delay from third quarter to fourth quarter. And if you take that into account, China grew roughly 4%-ish, despite that headwind.  We expect our colleagues to, of course, enjoy the Chinese New Year, reconnect with their families after several years and we see the same with the customers. So, step-by-step, I think China will open up. We expect better growth in the second half of the year than the first half. But Vijay, as you can imagine, it's anyone's guess how fast this comes back. We currently assume a high single-digit-ish, sort of growth for the full-year with the second half of the year being stronger than the first half. Amol, do you want to talk about the guide in FX?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, I mean, look, Vijay, the FX situation has improved versus what we said at the end of Q3 earnings call. Now, we are looking at 1% headwind on sales and about 3% headwind on EPS. The 3% headwind on EPS translates to about 50 basis points headwind on operating margin. And the reason for that is, I mean, U.S. dollar progressively strengthened throughout the course of 2022, and then it, sort of weakened towards the end of 2022. But where it is today, it is still a significant headwind for the first half of the year 2023, and that is, sort of playing through the numbers. And the reason there is an headwind on the operating margin is, we are one of the most geographically diversified companies in the sector, and we have a lot of revenue coming out of markets like Japan and China. And while we are operationally hedged in a currency like euro and pound, we still have significant profit there. So, if you have a headwind that profit shrinks, and then we don't have the level of cost structure in these other markets like China and Japan, which then creates higher FX flow-through on our operating margin versus our sales profile by a little bit. And that's why you see the headwind on FX, on operating margin.\nUdit Batra: And just, Vijay, your question on pricing, it was roughly 300 basis points. For this year, we expect 200 basis points as an assumption for 2023. And you can imagine that's largely because the inflation is still not gone. Second, our new products definitely should command a higher margin as we go forward. And then, finally, the teams have built a muscle through these very, very difficult times on passing on pricing wherever it seems [reasonable] [ph].\nAmol Chaubal: And [indiscernible], I mean we had 80 basis points of headwind on FX. And the business was resilient. It sort of offset pretty much all that impact and delivered a flat operating margin. So, if dollar goes back to where it started back in 2022, I mean, all the work is done in terms of margin expansion.\nUdit Batra: Now going into the year, we feel very good about where our margin profile is.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful Udit. And one quick one on the acquisition, 70 million of revenue synergies. That's a big number relative to Wyatt's revenue base. Can you give us some background on how well was this asset known? What kind of due diligence was done? What Wyatt's revenue mix is coming from established biopharma versus early stage? What gives you the confidence in the revenue synergy?\nUdit Batra: It's a lot of questions. I'll try to take them one after the other. 80% of the applications for Wyatt are in large molecule applications. As you know, we screen, and we were pretty clear on the Investor Day, we screen a lot of targets. And I can tell you without reservation, in bioanalytical, biophysical characterization, this is the Number 1 asset that we had in our minds. So, when we spoke with Geof and we spoke with Cliff, and we started our discussions, this was not something that's unknown to us. We've known company really well, really well for a significant period of time. And what Waters does on the chemical characterization, on the composition of characterization, Wyatt does for using light scattering for physical characterization. So with 80% of their revenues coming from large molecules, the growth is roughly 20%-ish on a three-year CAGR. Margins are accretive to our margins. And as I said before, this is not something that we see in the industry as much. 110 million in sales already. It will be accretive to our revenue growth and margin growth to our revenue and margins on day one. And to the 70 million, it comes across four dimensions. First, Wyatt is heavily concentrated in the United States, and to some extent, in Europe with less than 20% of their sales coming from APAC. And as you know, with Waters, geographically quite diversified, with APAC constituting 40% of our sales. We think there's a significant opportunity to expand and serve many more customers in fast-growing areas across the globe. Second, we want to provide customers with many more choices. If you look at light scattering instruments, especially MALS, it is sold with SEC columns, and Waters has leading SEC columns industry. The LC is used as a separator before you insert products, insert molecules into light scattering for characterization, not dissimilar to mass spec. We think the attachment rates could be significantly higher as we do the software integration across the two companies.  Number 3, it starts us on the journey of building a bioanalytical platform with a suite of products that all eventually have one compliance software that can be used across to submit data to regulators. And then, finally, there is an immediate opportunity to serve our customers a really big pain point of taking MALS into QA/QC, and who better than Waters to usher that journey through. So, that's why we think, by year five, there's a potential for [70-plus million] [ph] in synergies and even higher if the bioanalytical platform starts getting established sooner than we do Empower integration faster. So that, I think, gives you a color across the synergies, Vijay.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the acquisition and the quarter. Maybe just, if you could help us put a, kind of a finer point on services and chemistry growth in 2023. Udit, I heard your comment about think about it, sort of at the high-end of your guide, but just given the instrument growth that you've seen in 2022 and previous to that, how should we be thinking about services and chemistry growth in 2023?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So, Matt, it's a great question. Look, I mean, it's a prudent guide at this stage on services in particular, right. I mean service definitely will benefit from the incredible growth that we've seen in instruments over the last two years. In addition, we've increased our attachment rates by 250 basis points since we started our transformation journey roughly to roughly two-ish years ago. But I think at this point in time, especially given the uncertainty we see in China, we think it's a prudent starting point to assume what we've assumed for service. And for chemistry, I mean, it goes from strength-to-strength. We've seen our e-commerce platform do extremely well. We now have about 35% of our sales going through e-commerce. We intend to increase that number higher. MaxPeak premier columns and the pipeline looks extremely good, especially serving larger mole complex therapies. And now with a deeper understanding after the acquisition closes of the biologics space, we think there's a significant growth opportunity there as well. And there, too, we are a bit prudent thinking through what the rest of the year holds, especially in China. So, I think that's how I would look at it, right. So, really positive, but really thinking through how the year will emerge in China. And as the year progresses, we'll have more information.\nMatt Sykes: Great. And then just one quick follow-up on Europe. Obviously, very strong growth there in Q4 and for the full-year. Obviously, a mild winter there, so things seem to be better than expected. Could you just talk about what you're assuming for Europe this year and kind of thoughts in terms of the end market demand within Europe for 2023?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Look, I mean Europe has been a standout across the board, right, through the early parts of the pandemic and then, of course, this year itself. And also, on a stacked basis, it looks extremely good. The full-year numbers for Europe were in the double-digit range as you've seen. As we look ahead, I mean, our assumptions are still, sort of going back to markets [indiscernible] in Europe, which is mid-to-high single-digits for the balance of 2023. The orders look extremely good across all end markets. And I'll remind you that Europe is more heavily weighted towards pharma. And then in the mass spec space, Europe came out really, really strong, especially with applications in food testing for the Xevo TQ Absolute and environmental testing, which is where we saw the first and the fastest adoption of mass spec portfolio. So, mid- to high single digits with all the puts and takes, really excited about what we're seeing in terms of mass spec, especially in pharma and industrial in Europe.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks. Thanks for the questions. And obviously, congrats on the quarter and this deal. Maybe just one on Wyatt to start off. Just kind of a multi-part of your obvious question is the company has been growing 20%, your guidance is 10% to 12%. Is that just prudence or is there any [indiscernible] the numbers just kind of why, why that delta? And then could you just clarify like what percent of their business \u2013 you said 80% is biologics? What percent of that is actually used in manufacturing, whether on a clinical basis or on a commercial basis versus R&D today?\nUdit Batra: So look, Dan, firstly, thank you for your question. You can imagine that we're just getting into the integration, and there is, of course, a little bit of prudence built in, and we want to make sure that we start off on the right foot. As the integration goes, we don't expect the business to slow down, but that's \u2013 the low double-digit guide has that in the assumptions.  And in terms of biologics, I mean, a bulk of the applications are in large pharma, in discovery and development and in QA/QC and online and at-line testing. So, I mean, I think that's where you see most of the applications and increasingly now more weighted towards cell and gene therapy applications where the small particles need to be characterized really well before they are injected into people. So, I hope that gives you more color. And we don't intend to break down the full biologics piece, but you can imagine it's mostly late stage and [PAD testing] [ph] and QA/QC, Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean not much COVID in the numbers, right? So it's pretty clean in that sense. So, I would say a bit prudence there. And then here on the second piece, I mean, light scattering is further along in terms of upstream adoption in large molecule setting. I mean, as Geof mentioned, customers are eager to take it downstream. And now with this, and with our Empower platform, we will be able to accelerate that journey.\nUdit Batra: And then just one last thing. I've used light scattering myself in my Ph.D., I didn't want to let the call finish without stating this. And I was reviewing my Ph.D. thesis before this call. And you know what, of course, it's great. And for the life [indiscernible], I don\u2019t understand all the equations that I was using to analyze it. So, we're super excited even at a personal level to get access to the technology.\nDan Brennan: Great. And then just maybe one on the instrument outlook. Listen, kudos, the growth has been outstanding. Just wondering on the 5% instrument outlook, I mean investors have become accustomed to Waters' exceeding the numbers that you put out, and there's still a lot of really positive momentum there. It looks like it's around an 8% four-year CAGR, if you want to look at that. Just kind of give us a sense what's baked in on the 5%, Udit, maybe for mass spec specifically? And is there \u2013 like that 8% CAGR, I know you\u2019ve kind of talked about the 3% to 4% long-term trend, and you're trying to be prudent here, but just maybe give us a sense on what the mass spec contribution is? And to the extent we were to get 12 months out, and you were to be stronger than that? Like where do you think the biggest opportunity would be for that? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Dan, same thing, right? I mean we don't expect mass spec to fall off a cliff. I mean the applications are tremendous. The 5%-ish, I mean, the math is pretty simple, right? I mean, 3% to 4% long-term growth, 100 basis points of pricing in addition to the past and about 100 basis points of commercial execution and innovation in that number. And you can imagine, I mean, look, coming off such really, really strong growth over the last two years, we think the growth will start to normalize. Now that said, there's also a bit of prudence with China built in, right. I mean China is one of our fastest-growing markets. And I think, at this point in time, we feel comfortable saying, look, it's a high single-digit market by the end of the year. If the recovery goes faster, of course, there's upside and if they is more traction for new products, there is upside, right. So, I think it's a great place to start the year, and we'll keep you posted as more facts emerge.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. And thank you for taking my question. Can we talk a little bit about the pharma business, please? The 6% growth in the quarter, a little bit lower than we were looking for. Can you unpack that, talk about what was the potential impact from China? What are you seeing in demand at CROs and CDMOs, I mean that's been a driver? Have they pulled back on capital spending at all? And just, sort of your major peer in LC has talked about some of the slowing of the replacement cycle in LC and pharma in the second half of the year. Just sort of wondering what you're going to bake in for that? So, just a little bit more color on your pharma business, please. Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Thanks, Derik, for the question. Look, I mean pharma is a healthy end market. We see no weakness in pharma, especially as we are in the late stages of pharma, right. Discovery \u2013 sorry, late-stage development in QA/QC. From the numbers perspective, on a full-year basis, it's double-digit growth for the Q, it came in at 6%, largely because of China. If you exclude China, it's also double-digit growth. That should hopefully give you some clarity on what we're seeing in pharma. Going forward, we don't see the demand abating at all, right. We see significant demand for our products on the instrument side, especially mass spec and to some extent, LCs with the new products as well. We see very nice traction on the consumable side and service should benefit from really strong instrument growth that we've seen over the past two years. So, I see really no slowdown, especially as the portfolio now even more so goes towards large molecules, especially biologics, on mass spec, on LC with the instruments, especially like Acuity Premier for consumables, especially with MaxPeak. And with mass spec, with the BioAccord gaining increasing traction, with the G3 Qtof gaining more and more traction, we feel very good about what we see in pharma going forward. Now to your question on slowdown on LC cycles, look, I mean, we don't expect any of the instruments to be overall growing between 16% and 20% like we've seen in the last couple of years. I mean that's \u2013 we've always been very clear about it. Where the new normal occurs is something that will emerge over the next few months, but it's not going to go back to zero or negative growth, that we are 100% certain, right. So that's why we've guided 5% to 6.5%, and Dan had asked that question earlier on what is the justification for 5%. We think it's a prudent starting point for the year. Amol, anything to add on the instrument side?\nAmol Chaubal: No, I think you covered it well.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. [Indiscernible] on the quarter and the deal. So, first up, I just, kind of on the follow-up on some of these China comments. You talked about China returning to high single-digit growth for the year in 2023, but I really wanted to dig into the expectations embedded into that 1Q guide for China. So, you noted that China declined low-single-digits in 4Q, and that you expect that to continue into 1Q. So, can you just give us some color on, do you expect further sequential declines in China? And then how much of a headwind do you think China will be to that 4% to 6% growth that you've guided to for 1Q?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, I mean, look, we expect some of the headwinds we saw in China in Q4 to continue into Q1. And our adjusted Q4, when you adjust for that shipping was sort of 4%, and we think sort of our Q1 in China would be similar. And then as we know, you know China bounces back very quickly. And so, we expect that trend to, sort of catch up through the remainder of the year when people are back to work.\nUdit Batra: Yes. In terms of end markets \u2013 Rachel, this Udit, in terms of end markets, in terms of what we see as visibility, there is no signal that the fundamental demand for our products in China is slowing down. There is no sub signal. So, we feel very good about China and it's a good place to start at the beginning of the year to assume a high single-digit-ish growth. And as I mentioned, if the recovery is faster, of course, you expect faster growth.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Josh Waldman, Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Waldman: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Udit, I appreciate you were reviewing your Ph.D. thesis before the call, really covering all your bases. Just two questions for you, I think, Udit. Wondered if you could give us an update on where you think Waters is in the LC replacement opportunity? Maybe comment on what portion of the LC sold in 2022 were in the Acuity or Arc platform versus legacy alliance? And what you think that could look like in 2023? Just I guess curious your thoughts on like if we do see a slowing in the LC replacement cycle, kind of broadly, do you think Waters' push to rotate customers into the [new RLC] [ph] platforms could elongate that refresh?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Josh, thank you for your comment. Look, on the LC replacement cycle, and I guess, overall, the instrument replacement cycle, we've been pretty clear, we're almost one-third of the way through in 2022 when we started about two years, two-ish years ago. So, there's a pretty significant runway. Now, it's \u2013 these things don't go in a smooth, smooth way, right? So, they go in \u2013 given that these are large orders, they go in a lumpy cycle, be it LC, be it mass spec, be it Acuity, be it Arc. So, I think that's the first comment on what you should expect in terms of smoothness of the growth. Second, in terms of what has accelerated the growth and how the replacement cycle has happened? Undoubtedly, the introduction of Arc HPLC has given the customers a more of an [impetus] [ph] to replace the old alliance instruments. And that has helped us quite a bit. Some of them have also replaced it with the Acuity line, which is more the UPLC space. But like-for-like, there are equal number of customers who've gone from Alliance to Alliance, customers have gone from Alliance to Arc, and then fewer have gone from Alliance to Acuity. Acuity, I'll remind you, is a UPLC platform, whereas Arc HPLC was specifically designed for high volume small molecule applications in QA/QC, and it's a direct, sort of replacement for Alliance. So, I hope that gives you a bit more color. But I think the right assumption would be Alliance to Arc HPLC and Alliance to Alliance. And then Acuity, small minority of applications.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Good morning. Congrats on the Wyatt deal, had just a question on that, which is, could you tell us what is their mix today of instruments versus recurring? Do you think there's any opportunity to shift that over time? And then just one clarification, $70 million of revenue synergies, is that included in the low to mid-teens growth you talked about? Or is that being additive or...\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, let me quickly cover the second one. The load double-digit growth that we're talking about, that's the stand-alone business, the 70 million synergies that we are talking about are sort of incremental to that. And on the first question, there's roughly about 75% of the revenue is instruments, roughly a quarter today is what we traditionally call recurring revenue. But as you know with Waters, we think instruments are also recurring. And again, there is a great opportunity on that, not just on the light scattering platform, but also the HPLC and the SEC columns that go with it.\nUdit Batra: Yes. I mean \u2013 and with such a significant service team around the globe, slightly shy of 2,000 people, we believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase the service attachment rates. And in addition, about 1,400 to 1,500 sales, field sales representatives should help us increase penetration of light scattering. And Geof is smiling, as I say that, light scattering is deeper into our collective customer segments. So extremely, extremely excited about the opportunity there. But as Amol said, we think of instruments as recurring just as much as we think of service and consumables. They just recur over a longer time frame. And if you're disciplined, you can make sure that they are.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. Udit, maybe one on the industrial piece, that put up pretty nice growth in the quarter, I think, in the mid-teens. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? I mean, I know in the past quarters, you talked a little bit about PFAs testing, environmental being nice tailwinds. So, maybe just talk to what you're hearing from the customer base their expectations into 2023. Thanks.\nUdit Batra: Sure. So thanks for the question, Patrick. Industrial for the year just on the fact, I mean, grew 15%. And we saw nice high teens in the U.S., mid-teens in Europe, China, high single digit to low teens despite the lockdowns. And industrial across the board, right, so applications in food testing with the Xevo TQ Absolute, with PFAs testing was excellent. The PA business with battery testing, especially with the introduction of our new [indiscernible], we see incredible opportunity there to increase penetration of our existing instruments, and that's been going extremely well. And electronics, electronic chemicals testing has also been doing extremely well in the TA business, which has been in the high teens in the Industrial segment. So industrial, across all regions, across the food and environmental segments, as well as materials segment has been doing extremely well. So, I hope that gives you color on how we explained the results so far. Going forward, with the new products, there is a lot more runway for Xevo TQ Absolute and PFAs applications. We intend, of course, to take that instrument into the pharma space. We think there's incredible opportunity. For TA, we are seeing really, really good traction of our products in the battery testing value chain, all the way from raw materials to process development, not unlike bioprocessing, to now establishing online, at-line testing with our instruments for several of our customers. So, also going forward, a really healthy outlook. And I think the only prudence that we, sort of built-in is with what we expect in China, like China is a pretty strong grower in that segment as well, and we want to make sure that we get more data before we start reaching out more.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Puneet Souda, SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda : Yes. Hi, Udit and Geoff, congrats on this acquisition. It's great to see a light scattering outlook going into QA/QC. So, maybe my first question there is, when we look at the downstream QA/QC and late stages, when you look at the [five-year 70 million] [ph] synergies, is that sort of the time line you're thinking about moving light scattering into a number of these applications? And, Udit, could you maybe elaborate what is needed to integrate MALS into Empower? And what's the, sort of the outlook for Empower potentially becoming, sort of the backbone for biomolecules with BioAccord and light scattering? And last one, if I could squeeze in, any thoughts on the China loan stimulus benefit for 2023? Thank you.\nOperator: To your first question, Puneet \u2013 thanks for the question. So, your first question on light scattering and its application in biologics, light scattering is actually further ahead than mass spec in late stages of characterization of particles. As you can imagine \u2013 and particles being biologics here. As you can imagine, proteins, when they are purified, can sometimes appear as aggregates. And this can create severe immunogenetic responses in patients. And so, light scattering is the technique of choice to ensure that the proteins that we consume as therapeutics or viral vectors for cell and gene therapy are not aggregated. This is the instrument of choice for it. So, there is a pretty significant penetration in some large accounts and key accounts for light scattering. We see a lot of opportunity in that area to expand geographically and also to take it into key accounts that Waters has had and relationships at Waters has had, especially in QA/QC.  Now, to your question on Empower, look, I would think about software in two to three steps, right. The first step is to make sure that the instruments talk to each other, and that work has been ongoing for a while as the companies have collaborated over the years. And so, there's a data bridge that would be built, rather seamless data bridge so our customers can transfer data from one instrument to the other and control one instrument from the software of the other. The final piece is, of course, on Empower and the compliance software. That is an ambition that we have for instruments across the board, not just light scattering for mass spec, as well as LC-UV and several other instruments. And that's a journey that we have started with the Waters Connect platform. The architecture is rather open. So, you can imagine, over the next one to two years, you should start to see serious progress in that direction. So, it's slightly longer term than the immediate talking of instruments to each other and transferring data from one to the other.\nAmol Chaubal: And just to clarify that, on the 70 million that we talk about, there is very little \u2013 or we are assuming that is the time where it's super early days on Empower. Most of that is coming really from geographical expansion and SEC column and HPLC attachment.\nUdit Batra: Yes. So, the first two synergies, geographic expansion, segment expansion, increased attachment over the next five-year period get us to close to 70 million. And the last two, the larger sort of opportunities, the more ambition with the bioanalytical platform. And taking MALS into QC with Empower is something that we expect in the latter part of the five-year period, but not a significant contribution to the 70 billion.\nAmol Chaubal: And then the last piece on China, Puneet, I mean it's early days. We're still evaluating. Hard to put a number at this stage on that.\nUdit Batra: So at this point, I want to thank you for your participation and all your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, on behalf of Geof and Cliff and the Wyatt family, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. All parties may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. It's been great to work with Geoff, Cliff, and the entire team at Wyatt Technology. Like Udit, I'm very thankful to the Wyatt family for considering us as the rightful stewards of their mission and legacy and for providing us this opportunity to create value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now, to the transaction highlights. This 1.36 billion investment will result in immediate accretion of our revenue growth and our adjusted operating margin percentage. The synergies that Udit just described, along with Wyatt's highly attractive financials, are expected to result in accretive non-GAAP EPS impact as early as first quarter of 2024. Altogether, as Udit mentioned, this combination is expected to deliver a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five. We will fund this investment through cash on our balance sheet and existing debt capacity that is available on our revolver. On day one, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2.3. We will temporarily suspend our share buyback program for the remainder of 2023 and will utilize our free cash flow to pay down the debt through the rest of the year. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to land at around 1.7 by year-end 2023. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. Now, to our fourth quarter financial results. We delivered an excellent close to a very strong year for Waters with constant currency growth of 9%. Waters division grew 8%, and TA grew 15%. By end market, pharma grew 6%, Industrial grew 14%, and academic and government grew 8%, which Udit already covered. By geography, sales in Asia grew 7%, Americas grew 8%, and Europe grew 11%. In Asia, growth in region overall was strong. Japan grew 25% and India grew 15%. China declined low single digits for the quarter, as a sharp increase in COVID infections at year-end resulted in delayed spending due to customer site closures. We expect these headwinds from the post-zero COVID reopening to continue into the first quarter of 2023 before catching up throughout the remainder of the year. In other regions, the U.S. grew 8% and Europe grew 11% with broad strength across end-markets. By products and services, instruments grew 10%, led by mass spec, which grew over 30%. Recurring revenues grew 7% with chemistry up 8%, and service up 7%. Finally, TA grew 15% with double-digit growth across our major geographies. Growth was led by sales in electronics, and battery applications, as well as strong growth in advanced materials and chemical testing. Looking now at our full-year results. By end market, pharma grew 10%, industrial grew 15%, and academic and government grew 13%. In pharma, growth was led by large molecule applications, which grew mid-teens, while small molecule grew high-single-digits. By geography, sales in Asia grew 12%. Americas grew 14%, and Europe grew 10%. By products and services, instruments grew 16% for the full-year with liquid chromatography, mass spec, and TA system sales all up double-digits. In our recurring revenues, chemistry grew 9% supported by our strong launch of MAX peak premier columns in large molecule applications and further expansion in digital commerce adoption. Service grew 8% with continued expansion in attachment rates, which increased 150 basis points in 2022 and have increased 350 basis points since 2019. Now, I would like to comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 59.4%, up 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by sales volume and pricing, partially offset by inflationary costs. For the full-year, gross margin came in as expected at 58%. Operating margin for the quarter was 33.7%, growth of 110 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin dynamics. For the full-year, operating margin was approximately 30.2%, which was flat with last year. On an underlying basis, we expanded our operating margins by approximately 100 basis points versus our guide of 20 basis points to 30 basis points at the beginning of the year. This is net of our investments in higher growth adjacencies and despite the higher instrument mix in our revenue. On an as reported basis, our expansion was offset by 80 basis points of FX headwinds and 20 basis points of additional compensation to help our colleagues with the temporary impacts of inflation. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 17.6% and for the full-year it was 15.6%. For the full-year as anticipated, our effective tax rate increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to change regarding the capitalization of R&D costs. Average share count came in at 59.6 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the fourth quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter increased 5% to $3.84, compared with $3.67 last year. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings for fully diluted share was $3.81. For the full-year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share increased 7% to $12.02, versus $11.20 in the prior year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 9%. On a GAAP basis, full-year earnings per share was $11.73. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet, we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the fourth quarter of 2022, free cash flow was 145 million after funding 62 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from this free cash flow was $8 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. In the quarter, we continued to build inventory to secure supply and build safety stock, given strong instrument demand. For the full-year, free cash flow was 506 million after funding 176 million of capital expenditures and includes approximately 100 million of additional inventory versus the prior year-end. Excluded from the free cash flow, was 32 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a 38 million tax reform payment. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity, and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This trend allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, which will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive adjacent markets. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 475,000 shares of our common stock for 149 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately 1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1. Now, as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our thoughts for 2023. We have seen strong performance throughout 20 22, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across our geographies, and new product introductions driving growth. As we enter 2023, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid in our durable end markets and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. These dynamic support of full-year 20 23 guidance of organic constant currency sales growth of 5% to 6.5%, excluding Wyatt. At current rates, negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1 percentage point resulting in full-year reported organic sales growth guidance of 4% to 5.5%. We expect the Wyatt transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023, and depending on the timing, we expect it to add approximately 2% to 3% to our full-year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is 6% to 8.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt. For the full-year 2023, organic gross margin is expected to be approximately 58% and organic operating margin is expected to be approximately 30%. Before FX, this includes 20 basis points to 30 basis points of net margin expansion after 70 basis points to 80 basis points of investment in high growth adjacencies. FX is expected to be a headwind of 50 basis points, particularly in the first half of the year. The addition of Wyatt in Q2 is expected to be accretive to our full-year 2023 adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points to 30 basis points. Excluding the transaction, we expect our full-year net interest expense to be approximately 42 million. The transaction is expected to add 27 million to 43 million of additional interest expense, depending on the timing of the close. The full-year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Since we will be temporarily suspending our share repurchase program for the remainder of the year and using free cash flow to pay down debt, our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full-year 2023 earnings for fully diluted share guidance, excluding the transaction is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90. This represents 6% to 7% growth versus last year and includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. The Wyatt transaction is expected to be accretive to EPS, as early as in the first quarter of 2024. And this is even net of our share buyback suspension for the remainder of 2023. Overall, we expect it to deliver a high single digit plus adjusted return on invested capital, net of tax by year five. Due to interest expense incurred on higher debt balance, and the suspension of share repurchase program this year, the transaction is expected to result in a 2023 EPS headwind of approximately $0.15. Hence, including Wyatt, non-GAAP full-year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the first quarter of 2023, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 4% to 6%, which is 10% to 11% on a two-year stacked growth. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points resulting in first quarter reported sales growth guidance of flat to 2%. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 with a negative currency impact of approximately 6 percentage points. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. So, I mean, look, Vijay, the FX situation has improved versus what we said at the end of Q3 earnings call. Now, we are looking at 1% headwind on sales and about 3% headwind on EPS. The 3% headwind on EPS translates to about 50 basis points headwind on operating margin. And the reason for that is, I mean, U.S. dollar progressively strengthened throughout the course of 2022, and then it, sort of weakened towards the end of 2022. But where it is today, it is still a significant headwind for the first half of the year 2023, and that is, sort of playing through the numbers. And the reason there is an headwind on the operating margin is, we are one of the most geographically diversified companies in the sector, and we have a lot of revenue coming out of markets like Japan and China. And while we are operationally hedged in a currency like euro and pound, we still have significant profit there. So, if you have a headwind that profit shrinks, and then we don't have the level of cost structure in these other markets like China and Japan, which then creates higher FX flow-through on our operating margin versus our sales profile by a little bit. And that's why you see the headwind on FX, on operating margin. And [indiscernible], I mean we had 80 basis points of headwind on FX. And the business was resilient. It sort of offset pretty much all that impact and delivered a flat operating margin. So, if dollar goes back to where it started back in 2022, I mean, all the work is done in terms of margin expansion. Yes. I mean not much COVID in the numbers, right? So it's pretty clean in that sense. So, I would say a bit prudence there. And then here on the second piece, I mean, light scattering is further along in terms of upstream adoption in large molecule setting. I mean, as Geof mentioned, customers are eager to take it downstream. And now with this, and with our Empower platform, we will be able to accelerate that journey. No, I think you covered it well. Yes. So, I mean, look, we expect some of the headwinds we saw in China in Q4 to continue into Q1. And our adjusted Q4, when you adjust for that shipping was sort of 4%, and we think sort of our Q1 in China would be similar. And then as we know, you know China bounces back very quickly. And so, we expect that trend to, sort of catch up through the remainder of the year when people are back to work. Yes. So, let me quickly cover the second one. The load double-digit growth that we're talking about, that's the stand-alone business, the 70 million synergies that we are talking about are sort of incremental to that. And on the first question, there's roughly about 75% of the revenue is instruments, roughly a quarter today is what we traditionally call recurring revenue. But as you know with Waters, we think instruments are also recurring. And again, there is a great opportunity on that, not just on the light scattering platform, but also the HPLC and the SEC columns that go with it. And just to clarify that, on the 70 million that we talk about, there is very little \u2013 or we are assuming that is the time where it's super early days on Empower. Most of that is coming really from geographical expansion and SEC column and HPLC attachment. And then the last piece on China, Puneet, I mean it's early days. We're still evaluating. Hard to put a number at this stage on that."

            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Before diving in, I would like to extend our thoughts and our prayers to the thousands of those who are affected in Turkey and Syria by the earthquakes. Today marks a major milestone in accelerating value creation for our customers and shareholders as we progress to the next step in the execution of our strategy. This morning, we made the exciting announcement that Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering will be joining forces with Waters, bringing with it a fast growing, attractive business with key capabilities to accelerate our 1.8 billion double-digit growth opportunity in Bioprocess Characterization. More than 40 years ago, Wyatt was the first commercialized light scattering instruments incorporating lasers as their light source. Ever since they've defined and redefined state-of-the-art light scattering instrumentation, software, and services. Along the way, we've also added several related technologies including dynamic light scattering, viscometry, refractometry, and field-flow fractionation. Together, the innovative products are used to determine the properties of novel therapeutics such as cell and gene therapy, vaccines, and proteins, as well as synthetic polymers and nanoparticles. Wyatt was the top asset and priority we identified for bioanalytical characterization, making the acquisition a significant step forward in this high growth adjacency. I would like to take this opportunity to invite Geof and Cliff to say a few words about this exciting combination. Geof? Thank you, Geoff, and thank you, Cliff. We are honored to get this unique opportunity to carry Wyatt forward into the future. This combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other. And as you highlighted Geoff, our shared deep scientific culture and common passion for customer success will accelerate integration and drive value creation for our customers and shareholders in the years to come. Today, Waters has a strong and growing portfolio serving large molecule separation and characterization, which are approximately 30% of our pharmaceutical revenues. These applications serve high volume downstream workflows in biologic development and QA/QC Central Labs using LC-UV and LC-MS. Wyatt's significant exposure to the very fast growing biologic applications will build on this presence and will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecules, including gene therapy and viral vectors. For Wyatt, as Cliff mentioned, this combination will provide expanded geographic reach and will accelerate the adoption of light scattering and downstream applications through our established presence and empowered informatics platform. As you can tell, we're excited to share more details about the strategic benefits of this combination. However, this is our fourth quarter and our full-year earnings call, and we have some excellent results to share with you first. So now, I will cover our key messages and financial results for the core business. Then we will continue outlining the value of this combination as we take this next step in the evolution of our strategy. Looking at our financial results, we ended another very successful year delivering strong results in the fourth quarter with growth across our end markets. This was led by yet another outstanding double-digit instrument growth quarter. Our incredible performance this year would not have been possible without our dedicated and talented colleagues. We overcame numerous macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges throughout 2022, including global supply chain challenges, COVID lockdowns, inflationary pressures, and currency headwinds, all while responding to high customer demands for our products. Today, we have three key messages, which reflect the strength in our core business and the exciting future that lies ahead. First, we continue to deliver consistently strong execution. You can see this in our 2022 performance where we sustained strong growth after a stellar year in 2021. You can also see this in our three-year CAGR of approximately 9% in constant currency, where our results have placed us amongst the top players in the industry since the beginning of our transformation. Second, our revitalized portfolio has contributed to our growth and we expect this to continue. New products have resulted in growth opportunities in large molecules, applications, PFAs and battery testing, while supporting strong [core] [ph] instrument replacement. Third, while we have accomplished a lot in the past 2.5 years, we are now augmenting our organic efforts with M&A to accelerate our journey into high growth adjacencies. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Our revenue grew 3% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and regions with robust customer demand. Industrial was again our fastest growing end market, up 14% led by environmental testing, which grew over 20%; and TA, which grew mid-teens. Pharma saw continued robust growth, up 6% with strength in both small and large molecule applications. Strength was set by Europe, which grew low double digits, offset by headwinds in China. Academic and government grew 8% as in increased activity and funding resulted in strong year-end spending in several of our geographies. Instruments grew double-digits net by mass spec. New products contributed across our portfolio with Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier, and cyclic unit sales growing over 40% percent. Meanwhile, our newest instrument launches Xevo TQ Absolute, and Xevo G3 saw excellent continued traction with very strong demand. Recurring revenues grew high single digits supported by our e-commerce and service attachment growth initiatives. Our Q4 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $3.84. This is up 5% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 8%. For the full-year, revenue grew 7% as reported and 12% in constant currency. 2022 was a very strong year for Waters where we executed well throughout the organization against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Our growth was broad-based across our geographies and end markets. Each of which grew low-double-digits or above. This strength was led by instrument sales, which grew 16% for the year with LC, mass spec, and [TA Systems] [ph] all growing double-digits. For the full-year, non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $12.02. This is up 7% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds of 9%. Now, as we enter 2023, our end markets remain robust and healthy with strong customer demand for our products. These attractive end markets [indiscernible] growth drivers and are well funded. We saw solid auto growth in the fourth quarter and our backlog remains at elevated levels. We expect the strong instrument sales we saw in 2022 to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. So, our end markets are healthy. We've regained our commercial momentum. Innovation has been revitalized and we have strengthened our organization with new leadership capabilities, bringing a proven track record in transformation. Now, we're entering the next phase of our execution strategy as we accelerate our path toward faster growth. This brings us now to the chart on the next slide. As you can see, biologics manufacturing is a complex process and we have shared an example which shows how large scale monoclonal antibodies are produced. It starts with the upstream production of the drug substance where the raw material components are fingerprinted and monitored during initial cell culture creation before the protein or antibody of choice is produced. Then in downstream manufacturing, cells and debris are separated from the [indiscernible] in a series of filtration and separation steps. Each step involves numerous stages of testing to ensure that the product is stable and effective. Then as a last step, in QA/QC, the final purified drug product is formulated and filled in vials of prefilled syringes. Throughout the process, different tools and technologies are required for characterization, depending upon what you need to analyze liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or LC-UV is used extensively across all four stages. At the same time, mass spec is increasingly being used with BioAccord seeing a lot of traction in cell culture media characterization, clone selection and process optimization in both upstream and downstream manufacturing. It is also seeing adoption in QA/QC applications. We shared details on this at the beginning of the year and have included a slide in the appendix. In addition to LC-UV and LC-MS, powerful techniques such as dynamic light scattering and multi-angle light scattering are also used to give relevant information about the size, molecular weight, and aggregation of biologics by combining the data from each of these detectors our customers can develop a more comprehensive profile of their biologics. This is essential to speeding up the manufacturing process and reducing the cost of complex biologics such as cell and gene therapies. The bioanalytical characterization market is around 1.8 billion growing around 10% to 12%. Waters already has a strong established position in LC-UV and LC mass spec, whereas Wyatt Technology is a pioneer in light scattering. Hence this combination is a fantastic opportunity to integrate our powerful analytical technologies, which are highly complementary to each other and will accelerate our journey in this opportunity. Let me now ask Geof to describe the company and its highly innovative portfolio. Geoff? Thank you, Geoff. I look forward to welcoming our new colleagues to Waters. Let's now talk about some of the benefits that integrating Wyatt and Waters' capabilities that provide for our customers. In our existing Waters portfolio, our [LC system] [ph] separate complex mixtures into individual constituents for both property analysis by UV and detailed characterization by mass spec. These are properties such as titer aggregation and protein sequence. A missing piece has been additional critical information about the intact molecule, like the Empty/Full capsid ratio of adeno associated viruses or the size of lipid nano particles or mRNA therapies. These will be augmented by Wyatt's MALS detectors, which will allow our customers to develop a more comprehensive critical quality attribute profile for their biologics. This is essential to fully characterizing their manufacturing process. In each case for these tools to gain successful adoption in point of view settings, they must be: Number 1, sophisticated, but simple for use in high volume applications, such as what we've already demonstrated with BioAccord; Number 2, supported by leading service like Waters already has to help run workflows and respond to evolving needs; And Number 3, and most importantly, they need to be connected to a common informatics platform so that all the data comes together in one place. Our ambition is to create an ecosystem of sophisticated, yet simple instruments that can all use Empower to collect data and submit to regulators. No differently than what Waters established for small molecules years ago. This transaction will create a number of compelling revenue synergies and results in an attractive set of pro-forma financials. First, from a geographic footprint, Waters revenues are highly diversified, whereas Wyatt's presence is concentrated in the United States. This provides us an opportunity to expand Wyatt's geographic footprint in Europe and Asia, particularly in China. Second, HPLC instruments and size exclusion chemistry columns are sold together with light scattering instruments. We expect to see cross-selling synergies with our liquid chromatography instruments and chemistry. Third, Wyatt's instruments and expertise will enable Waters to meaningfully accelerate the high growth adjacency opportunity in bioanalytical characterization. This will give our customers an unmatched set of analytical solutions across large molecule applications and will augment our ability to create a comprehensive bioanalytical platform. And fourth, Wyatt's portfolio is well-established in upstream development settings for large molecule applications today. Waters' Empower platform, as well as our presence and expertise in high volume down-stream recurring applications will accelerate the use of light scattering and biologics manufacturing and in QA/QC. Now, to the pro-forma. The combination will increase our large molecule footprint to around 35% of our pharmaceutical revenues. Our increased exposure to these faster growing markets will raise the combined growth profile of the markets we serve by at least 50 basis points. We expect the transaction to contribute more than 60 basis points to our annualized constant currency growth over the next five years. We also expect it to add more than 50 basis points to our industry leading adjusted operating margin. Net, we expect to realize a high-single-digit plus return on invested capital by year five, although we expect the Wyatt business to grow low-double-digits in the near-to-mid-term. In addition, we expect this combination to create more than 70 million in annualized revenue synergies by year five. Now, I would like to pass the call to Amol to walk us through further details on the financings. He will then continue covering our fourth quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for 2023. Amol? Thank you, Amol, as I outlined at the beginning of our transformation journey and later at our Investor Day last year, our first focus was to regain our commercial momentum and strengthen our organization with new leadership capabilities. As you have observed over the last 2.5 years, we have delivered incredible results with consistently strong execution, and we have assembled an amazing leadership team that brings with it a proven track record in transformation, which is pivotal to driving seamless integration. Our second focus was to revitalize our portfolio. The success of our new product launches, the increased vitality index of our portfolio, and the rich pipeline ahead of us underscores our accomplishments this year. Today, we're entering our next phase, which is to accelerate value creation for our customers and shareholders by adding a fantastic fast growing technology platform. And increasing our capabilities to address high growth adjacent markets. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. Sure. Sure, Luke. Thank you for the question. So, instrument growth in the quarter, again, finished with double-digit instrument growth. For the year, it's 16%. And it's really across the board, right? For the full-year, you see mass spec well into the [20s] [ph], TA in the high-teens, LC also in the double-digit range. And this is largely due to the success of our commercial initiatives, which were around instrument replacement and really focusing on our new product launches.  And there you've seen a complete revitalization of the portfolio, especially on the mass spec side, where we've gained traction in biologics application with the Xevo G3 with the BioAccord more recently with the cyclic and [indiscernible] absolute for food and environmental applications [on the light] [ph]. On the LC side, same thing with Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier. So, you see very strong new products coming through, which are gaining traction. Now, as we look ahead, I mean, orders are as strong as ever. We see a very, very healthy backlog going into the year. And as we look forward, the end markets are still very robust, right. So, we don't expect \u2013 and across the board, they are pretty robust, in industrial pharma itself, as well as academic with additional funding, but as we look ahead, I would caution against using the 16% and extrapolating. I think we've been saying this for a while, these are incredible growth numbers.  On a stacked basis, you're looking at double-digit growth for instruments, but we cannot expect the instrument growth to continue at a double-digit level. I mean the long-term average is around 3% to 4%. And if I were to just dig into the guide a little bit, when we say 5% to 6.5%, so the 5% \u2013 if you just take the higher-end and then make it consistent, let's say, with the recurring revenues and the lower-end consistent with the instrument growth in the future, long-term averages for instrument growth are between 3% and 4%. Add 100 basis points of additional commercial execution and another 100 basis points for pricing, and there you have the 5%-ish instrument growth. So, we think it \u2013 long term, we should be seeing healthy instrument growth. And I've heard several comments which say, \u2018hey, you've seen serious significant instrument growth, will it come crashing down?' Not at all. We don't see any signs of that. We do see it reverting back to, sort of long-term growth averages, and we think we will out-execute the overall market growth with our commercial initiatives, with our new products and with additional pricing. This is a fantastic question. So, the orders are growing very nicely, Luke. And we've been saying that for a while, and they continue to do so. Now, moving on to Wyatt, look, it's a perfect strategic fit. We've been talking about bioanalytical characterization, a 1.8 billion market, growing 10% to 12%. And Wyatt a 110 million, I mean, there are hardly many companies that are accretive to us in the industry on margins, 40% margins and growing at a 20%-ish CAGR, right? So, terrific, terrific financial profile. When you look at the bioanalytical space, and you talk about LC-UV and LC-mass spec, LC-UV and mass spec are used to characterize the sequence of the proteins, the configuration of the proteins, the chemical composition, right. There are exquisite techniques to characterize the composition of the molecules and the composition of raw materials, upstream, downstream process development, and of course, in QA/QC. Light scattering, on the other hand, gives you biophysical characterization, the size of the molecule, the level of aggregation of the molecule, think about monoclonal antibodies and proteins. And even more exciting these days is what it does for us in viral vector therapies, empty versus full [indiscernible], right. Light scattering allows you to get at that lipid nanoparticles, how aggregated they are, how well characterized, how full they are with mRNA molecules. Super exciting applications. And our customers, and Geof and Cliff tell me, have been asking us \u2013 or their customers have been asking us to integrate it with a compliant software platform so they can use it in QA/QC applications. It's already used by a significant number of large pharma players as an at-line testing tool. So, super excited, highly complementary. It gives you even a better footprint of biologics. And our dream is \u2013 and our ambition is to make large molecule characterization similar to small molecule characterization as we've done in the past. So, I'll comment a bit on China first and what we expect there, and I'll pass it on to Amol to take it up from there. Look, Q4 in China, I mean, has been especially tough with 50% to 75% of our colleagues, at any point in time, being infected due to the reopening. And despite that, if you take from November last year, we had a shipment delay from third quarter to fourth quarter. And if you take that into account, China grew roughly 4%-ish, despite that headwind.  We expect our colleagues to, of course, enjoy the Chinese New Year, reconnect with their families after several years and we see the same with the customers. So, step-by-step, I think China will open up. We expect better growth in the second half of the year than the first half. But Vijay, as you can imagine, it's anyone's guess how fast this comes back. We currently assume a high single-digit-ish, sort of growth for the full-year with the second half of the year being stronger than the first half. Amol, do you want to talk about the guide in FX? And just, Vijay, your question on pricing, it was roughly 300 basis points. For this year, we expect 200 basis points as an assumption for 2023. And you can imagine that's largely because the inflation is still not gone. Second, our new products definitely should command a higher margin as we go forward. And then, finally, the teams have built a muscle through these very, very difficult times on passing on pricing wherever it seems [reasonable] [ph]. Now going into the year, we feel very good about where our margin profile is. It's a lot of questions. I'll try to take them one after the other. 80% of the applications for Wyatt are in large molecule applications. As you know, we screen, and we were pretty clear on the Investor Day, we screen a lot of targets. And I can tell you without reservation, in bioanalytical, biophysical characterization, this is the Number 1 asset that we had in our minds. So, when we spoke with Geof and we spoke with Cliff, and we started our discussions, this was not something that's unknown to us. We've known company really well, really well for a significant period of time. And what Waters does on the chemical characterization, on the composition of characterization, Wyatt does for using light scattering for physical characterization. So with 80% of their revenues coming from large molecules, the growth is roughly 20%-ish on a three-year CAGR. Margins are accretive to our margins. And as I said before, this is not something that we see in the industry as much. 110 million in sales already. It will be accretive to our revenue growth and margin growth to our revenue and margins on day one. And to the 70 million, it comes across four dimensions. First, Wyatt is heavily concentrated in the United States, and to some extent, in Europe with less than 20% of their sales coming from APAC. And as you know, with Waters, geographically quite diversified, with APAC constituting 40% of our sales. We think there's a significant opportunity to expand and serve many more customers in fast-growing areas across the globe. Second, we want to provide customers with many more choices. If you look at light scattering instruments, especially MALS, it is sold with SEC columns, and Waters has leading SEC columns industry. The LC is used as a separator before you insert products, insert molecules into light scattering for characterization, not dissimilar to mass spec. We think the attachment rates could be significantly higher as we do the software integration across the two companies.  Number 3, it starts us on the journey of building a bioanalytical platform with a suite of products that all eventually have one compliance software that can be used across to submit data to regulators. And then, finally, there is an immediate opportunity to serve our customers a really big pain point of taking MALS into QA/QC, and who better than Waters to usher that journey through. So, that's why we think, by year five, there's a potential for [70-plus million] [ph] in synergies and even higher if the bioanalytical platform starts getting established sooner than we do Empower integration faster. So that, I think, gives you a color across the synergies, Vijay. Yes. So, Matt, it's a great question. Look, I mean, it's a prudent guide at this stage on services in particular, right. I mean service definitely will benefit from the incredible growth that we've seen in instruments over the last two years. In addition, we've increased our attachment rates by 250 basis points since we started our transformation journey roughly to roughly two-ish years ago. But I think at this point in time, especially given the uncertainty we see in China, we think it's a prudent starting point to assume what we've assumed for service. And for chemistry, I mean, it goes from strength-to-strength. We've seen our e-commerce platform do extremely well. We now have about 35% of our sales going through e-commerce. We intend to increase that number higher. MaxPeak premier columns and the pipeline looks extremely good, especially serving larger mole complex therapies. And now with a deeper understanding after the acquisition closes of the biologics space, we think there's a significant growth opportunity there as well. And there, too, we are a bit prudent thinking through what the rest of the year holds, especially in China. So, I think that's how I would look at it, right. So, really positive, but really thinking through how the year will emerge in China. And as the year progresses, we'll have more information. Yes. Look, I mean Europe has been a standout across the board, right, through the early parts of the pandemic and then, of course, this year itself. And also, on a stacked basis, it looks extremely good. The full-year numbers for Europe were in the double-digit range as you've seen. As we look ahead, I mean, our assumptions are still, sort of going back to markets [indiscernible] in Europe, which is mid-to-high single-digits for the balance of 2023. The orders look extremely good across all end markets. And I'll remind you that Europe is more heavily weighted towards pharma. And then in the mass spec space, Europe came out really, really strong, especially with applications in food testing for the Xevo TQ Absolute and environmental testing, which is where we saw the first and the fastest adoption of mass spec portfolio. So, mid- to high single digits with all the puts and takes, really excited about what we're seeing in terms of mass spec, especially in pharma and industrial in Europe. So look, Dan, firstly, thank you for your question. You can imagine that we're just getting into the integration, and there is, of course, a little bit of prudence built in, and we want to make sure that we start off on the right foot. As the integration goes, we don't expect the business to slow down, but that's \u2013 the low double-digit guide has that in the assumptions.  And in terms of biologics, I mean, a bulk of the applications are in large pharma, in discovery and development and in QA/QC and online and at-line testing. So, I mean, I think that's where you see most of the applications and increasingly now more weighted towards cell and gene therapy applications where the small particles need to be characterized really well before they are injected into people. So, I hope that gives you more color. And we don't intend to break down the full biologics piece, but you can imagine it's mostly late stage and [PAD testing] [ph] and QA/QC, Amol? And then just one last thing. I've used light scattering myself in my Ph.D., I didn't want to let the call finish without stating this. And I was reviewing my Ph.D. thesis before this call. And you know what, of course, it's great. And for the life [indiscernible], I don't understand all the equations that I was using to analyze it. So, we're super excited even at a personal level to get access to the technology. Dan, same thing, right? I mean we don't expect mass spec to fall off a cliff. I mean the applications are tremendous. The 5%-ish, I mean, the math is pretty simple, right? I mean, 3% to 4% long-term growth, 100 basis points of pricing in addition to the past and about 100 basis points of commercial execution and innovation in that number. And you can imagine, I mean, look, coming off such really, really strong growth over the last two years, we think the growth will start to normalize. Now that said, there's also a bit of prudence with China built in, right. I mean China is one of our fastest-growing markets. And I think, at this point in time, we feel comfortable saying, look, it's a high single-digit market by the end of the year. If the recovery goes faster, of course, there's upside and if they is more traction for new products, there is upside, right. So, I think it's a great place to start the year, and we'll keep you posted as more facts emerge. Thanks, Derik, for the question. Look, I mean pharma is a healthy end market. We see no weakness in pharma, especially as we are in the late stages of pharma, right. Discovery \u2013 sorry, late-stage development in QA/QC. From the numbers perspective, on a full-year basis, it's double-digit growth for the Q, it came in at 6%, largely because of China. If you exclude China, it's also double-digit growth. That should hopefully give you some clarity on what we're seeing in pharma. Going forward, we don't see the demand abating at all, right. We see significant demand for our products on the instrument side, especially mass spec and to some extent, LCs with the new products as well. We see very nice traction on the consumable side and service should benefit from really strong instrument growth that we've seen over the past two years. So, I see really no slowdown, especially as the portfolio now even more so goes towards large molecules, especially biologics, on mass spec, on LC with the instruments, especially like Acuity Premier for consumables, especially with MaxPeak. And with mass spec, with the BioAccord gaining increasing traction, with the G3 Qtof gaining more and more traction, we feel very good about what we see in pharma going forward. Now to your question on slowdown on LC cycles, look, I mean, we don't expect any of the instruments to be overall growing between 16% and 20% like we've seen in the last couple of years. I mean that's \u2013 we've always been very clear about it. Where the new normal occurs is something that will emerge over the next few months, but it's not going to go back to zero or negative growth, that we are 100% certain, right. So that's why we've guided 5% to 6.5%, and Dan had asked that question earlier on what is the justification for 5%. We think it's a prudent starting point for the year. Amol, anything to add on the instrument side? Yes. In terms of end markets \u2013 Rachel, this Udit, in terms of end markets, in terms of what we see as visibility, there is no signal that the fundamental demand for our products in China is slowing down. There is no sub signal. So, we feel very good about China and it's a good place to start at the beginning of the year to assume a high single-digit-ish growth. And as I mentioned, if the recovery is faster, of course, you expect faster growth. Yes. So Josh, thank you for your comment. Look, on the LC replacement cycle, and I guess, overall, the instrument replacement cycle, we've been pretty clear, we're almost one-third of the way through in 2022 when we started about two years, two-ish years ago. So, there's a pretty significant runway. Now, it's \u2013 these things don't go in a smooth, smooth way, right? So, they go in \u2013 given that these are large orders, they go in a lumpy cycle, be it LC, be it mass spec, be it Acuity, be it Arc. So, I think that's the first comment on what you should expect in terms of smoothness of the growth. Second, in terms of what has accelerated the growth and how the replacement cycle has happened? Undoubtedly, the introduction of Arc HPLC has given the customers a more of an [impetus] [ph] to replace the old alliance instruments. And that has helped us quite a bit. Some of them have also replaced it with the Acuity line, which is more the UPLC space. But like-for-like, there are equal number of customers who've gone from Alliance to Alliance, customers have gone from Alliance to Arc, and then fewer have gone from Alliance to Acuity. Acuity, I'll remind you, is a UPLC platform, whereas Arc HPLC was specifically designed for high volume small molecule applications in QA/QC, and it's a direct, sort of replacement for Alliance. So, I hope that gives you a bit more color. But I think the right assumption would be Alliance to Arc HPLC and Alliance to Alliance. And then Acuity, small minority of applications. Yes. I mean \u2013 and with such a significant service team around the globe, slightly shy of 2,000 people, we believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase the service attachment rates. And in addition, about 1,400 to 1,500 sales, field sales representatives should help us increase penetration of light scattering. And Geof is smiling, as I say that, light scattering is deeper into our collective customer segments. So extremely, extremely excited about the opportunity there. But as Amol said, we think of instruments as recurring just as much as we think of service and consumables. They just recur over a longer time frame. And if you're disciplined, you can make sure that they are. Sure. So thanks for the question, Patrick. Industrial for the year just on the fact, I mean, grew 15%. And we saw nice high teens in the U.S., mid-teens in Europe, China, high single digit to low teens despite the lockdowns. And industrial across the board, right, so applications in food testing with the Xevo TQ Absolute, with PFAs testing was excellent. The PA business with battery testing, especially with the introduction of our new [indiscernible], we see incredible opportunity there to increase penetration of our existing instruments, and that's been going extremely well. And electronics, electronic chemicals testing has also been doing extremely well in the TA business, which has been in the high teens in the Industrial segment. So industrial, across all regions, across the food and environmental segments, as well as materials segment has been doing extremely well. So, I hope that gives you color on how we explained the results so far. Going forward, with the new products, there is a lot more runway for Xevo TQ Absolute and PFAs applications. We intend, of course, to take that instrument into the pharma space. We think there's incredible opportunity. For TA, we are seeing really, really good traction of our products in the battery testing value chain, all the way from raw materials to process development, not unlike bioprocessing, to now establishing online, at-line testing with our instruments for several of our customers. So, also going forward, a really healthy outlook. And I think the only prudence that we, sort of built-in is with what we expect in China, like China is a pretty strong grower in that segment as well, and we want to make sure that we get more data before we start reaching out more. Yes. So, the first two synergies, geographic expansion, segment expansion, increased attachment over the next five-year period get us to close to 70 million. And the last two, the larger sort of opportunities, the more ambition with the bioanalytical platform. And taking MALS into QC with Empower is something that we expect in the latter part of the five-year period, but not a significant contribution to the 70 billion. So at this point, I want to thank you for your participation and all your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, on behalf of Geof and Cliff and the Wyatt family, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in our company. Thank you very much."

Finally, we do not intend to update our predictions all projections except as part of our regularly scheduled, quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key messages for the quarter, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After we will open the phone lines up to take questions. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We continue to deliver excellent results in the third quarter with very strong growth across our product portfolio, our end markets and geographies. This was led by instrument growth of more than 20%. Similar to previous quarters, orders again outpaced sales. A result like this takes an exceptional effort and dedication from all our colleagues. We are very proud of what our teams continue to consistently deliver. Today, we have three key messages to share, which reflect the ongoing strength and exciting drivers of our business: first, we are consistently delivering strong commercial execution. Our transformation has become embedded in how we operate with a relentless focus on commercial excellence. You can see this in our results. Second, innovation at Waters is back. It's delivering across our portfolio and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is answering our customers' unmet needs across a variety of applications. Adoption rates for new instruments have been impressive and are driving market share gains. Thirdly, our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We continue to make measurable progress on our high growth adjacencies and have proof points that are giving us confidence. Turning now to our third quarter results, our revenue grew 7% as reported and 15% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and geographies with robust demand from our customers. Growth in the quarter was led by industrial and academic and government, which both grew over 20% and pharma, which grew 9%. Each of our regions grew double digits. China grew over 20%, India grew 20%, Europe grew mid-teens and the U.S. grew 11%. Instruments grew over 20% with our LC, mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Mass spec growth was very strong at almost 40%. Recurring revenues grew 10% supported by our growth initiatives in e-commerce and service attachment. Our Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.64, this is roughly flat year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 13%. Now looking at our year-to-date performance. We're executing well throughout the organization despite a tough macroeconomic environment. Our strength has been broad-based across our geographies and end markets, each of which are up double-digits this year. Pharma is up 12%, industrial is up 15% and academic and government is up 16%. Instrument growth has been very strong throughout the year, growing 19% year-to-date, led by the U.S. at almost 30%. We expect this to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. Our transformation has allowed us to consistently deliver excellent results. Our three year CAGR underscores the momentum we've built across our business. Year-to-date, we've delivered 9% three-year stack growth overall on a constant currency basis. Moving on to our second key message, Innovation. Waters has long been known as an innovation leader. Our investments in innovation are again driving results and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Sales of Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Max Premier columns again doubled in the quarter versus the previous year. Our new products are solving problems that matter to our customers supported by our technical strength and strong commercial execution. Arc HPLC is driving customers to upgrade their LC fleets used for routine small molecule analysis. This is advancing customer lab capabilities and productivity, while accelerating the cadence of instrument replacement. Our MaxPeak Premier technology separates complex molecules like biologics. By eliminating the need for passivation, MaxPeak columns can get scientist answers up to 20 times faster than their non-premier equivalent. They also give sharper peaks with 12 times the sensitivity when separating oligonucleotides as an example. The customer benefits around Premier are very compelling. This has resulted in significant large molecule growth in recent quarters, which now accounts for over 30% of our pharma revenues versus 20% just a few years ago. Today, Biologics represents 20% of the pharmaceutical market, but account for 40% of the R&D pipeline positioning us very well for future growth. With our cyclic ion mobility separation high resolution MassSpec, cyclic IMS for short, scientists can separate molecules by shape, as well as mass due to the combination of iron mobility with time of flight. This is providing customers with amplified resolution and clarity. Demand has ramped up for cyclic within Omics research for lipids, proteins and metabolites, all exciting areas within early disease detection and discovery. As an example, the largest privately funded MassSpec troriomics facility in Canada has been using Cyclic for antibody sequencing and discovery. They're impressed with the quality of data that Cyclic has provided supporting their lab at the forefront of scientific discovery. Also within Massspec, we're seeing great traction for our recently launched Xevo TQ Absolute. It has seen strong demand in food and environmental applications led by Per and polyfluonated compound testing. The PFAs testing market has seen rapid growth in recent months, driven by increased surveillance testing and newly added compounds of interest. We see this as a multiyear growth opportunity. In June of this year, the U.S. EPA announced new drinking water health advisories for the four most notorious PFAs compounds setting measurement levels finer than parts per billion. TQ Absolute is so sensitive, it can detect PFAs at one part or quadrillion. This is less than a grain of sand in an Olympic sized swimming pool. TQ Absolute's ability to quantity lower bundles molecules is beyond anything on the market and gives us the right to win in this space. Since launching TQ Absolute, we won competitive placement for PFAs testing across every region. In one example, a large global testing organization is using it for infant food and water testing in Southeast Asia. This customer is developing a new set of methods that can be used for routine testing across workflows in their organization. Within informatics, Waters Connect is enabling exciting new analytical areas in large molecule analysis. On instruments like the G3 Qtof and BioAccord. This includes cell culture media analysis, peptide mapping and oligonucleotide characterization. There is a lot of long-term potential in these areas given demand for stability, quality and impurity analysis. The characterization of biologics and novel modalities allows these molecules to move downstream into routine QA, QC workflows. Additionally at TA, we have added new powder rheology capabilities to our portfolio. This is to support the strong growth we're seeing in battery-related applications. Powders are critical to anode and cathode manufacturing allowing battery producers to better screen electrode coatings and solvent free dry coatings helps ensures optimal performance, prevent defects and reduce cell failure rates. According to industry sources, in the next 10 years, production of lithium ion batteries is expected to grow ten-fold. Demand is expected to exceed 4,000 gigawatt hours per year by 2032, driven by electric vehicles and energy storage. As battery volume scale RTA instrument portfolio is well positioned to support an expanding set of testing demands within the battery development and safety analysis space. One of our European customers, a fast growing Scandinavian battery producer, uses our rheumators to test incoming materials for critical electrode components. This company has tripled its purchases of DA instruments this year, reflecting not only its own growth, but the confidence they have in our technology and support as they scale their operations. I would now like to share some of the recent progress we've made in our -- towards a high growth adjacencies as our third key message. Since time is limited, I will only focus on Bioprocess Characterization. BioAccord offers a compelling value proposition to Bioprocess Engineers, it provides a paradigm shift in analytical capabilities for biologics manufacturing, which while being quick and easy to use. Through our collaboration with Sartorius, we have expanded the capabilities of BioAccord in this area. We can dramatically shorten clone selection times. We are also enabling improvements in tighter and yields, which can reduce COGS. Our value proposition is resonating amongst industry leaders. At the recent Bioprocess International Conference in Boston, which I attended personally, AstraZeneca publicly highlighted the benefits of implementing online process analytical technology using the BioAccord monitoring to monitor drug substance and cell culture media. Meanwhile, Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies are already using it to monitor vital components during cell culture production and for analysis of raw materials used in Bioprocessing. By fingerprinting components in Cell Culture Media using BioAccord, they are generating insights that can help streamline the manufacturing process. These are just a few of the early proof points we can share with you today for BioAccord. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity we have to solve unmet needs in Bioprocess Characterization. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3 with 15% constant currency growth. Waters division grew 14% and TA grew 18%. By end market, pharma grew 9%, industrial grew 22%, and academic and government grew 29%. In pharma, we saw growth in both large and small molecule with strength across segments, applications and regions. In industrial, each of our major regions grew mid-teens or above with China up almost 30%, Europe up over 20%, and U.S. growing 16%. Growth was led by LCMS instrument sales, which grew 50% with our chemical analysis, food and environmental businesses, all delivering strong growth. In academic and government, growth was also strong across all regions. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 18%, the Americas grew 11% and Europe grew 14%. In Asia, growth was led by China where sales grew 23% as we executed well across all trade classes, despite the challenges posed by new lockdowns. In the Americas, the U.S. grew 11% with growth across applications and end markets. Europe grew 14% in the quarter, led by industrial, which grew over 20% and pharma, which grew low double-digits. By products and services, instruments grew 21% with our LCMS and TA portfolios each growing double-digits. Recurring revenues grew 10% with chemistry up 10% and service up 9%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year's quarter. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis and rheology. Demand for TA products remained strong across all regions with sales in electronics, and batteries continuing to ramp. Gross margin for the quarter was 56.7%, compared to 58.9% in the third quarter of 2021. We had incredible growth in instrument sales this quarter with MassSpec growing nearly 40%. While this resulted in approximately 40 basis points of adverse mix impact for the quarter, it is expected to drive future margin accretive recurring revenue growth. The strong U.S. dollar resulted in 120 basis points of FX headwind on gross margin in the quarter. We have continued to offset the impact of inflation with pricing increases. Working with our customers, our teams delivered over 350 basis points of net pricing gains in the quarter. While inflation had no net impact on our gross profit dollars, it does affect margin calculation as the revenue base is also higher. This dynamics drove the remaining difference in the year-over-year gross margin for the quarter. But again, there was no net impact of inflation on gross profit dollars or earnings per share as the incremental inflationary costs were offset by pricing increases. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 27.8%, compared to 29.7% in the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds and the gross margin dynamics. Year-to-date operating margins have expanded 70 basis points before 110 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. The expansion of 70 basis points includes the investments we have been making to nurture our higher growth adjacencies and includes the impact of higher instrument mix and the inflation dynamics I just discussed. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%, average share count came in at 60.1 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter was $2.64 in comparison to $2.66 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 13%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.60. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $126 million after funding $32 million of capital expenditures. Since last quarter, accounts receivable have moved back in line with historical pattern relative to our sales volume. However, we continue to build inventory as a proactive measure to secure supply and build safety stock given strong instrument demand. In the third quarter, our inventory balance increased by $32 million. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive high growth adjacent markets. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 483,000 shares of our common stock for $155 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about $1.1 billion. Now as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022. We have seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across all our geographies and new product introductions, which are driving growth. As we close the year, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. We also expect to successfully navigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures assuming these challenges do not worsen. In light of this continued strong performance, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance to 11.5% to 12% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 9.5% to 10.5%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in a full-year reported sales growth guidance of 5.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full-year is expected to be nearly 58% and includes 100 basis points of FX headwinds versus prior year. Operating margin is expected to be 3.2%, which includes 120 basis points of underlying margin expansion offset by 120 basis points of FX headwind. We expect our full-year net interest expense to be approximately $38 million and full-year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.3 million. Our share repurchase program will continue as we progress through the rest of the year and we\u2019ll provide updates as appropriate. Rolling all these together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.85 to $11.95, which is 6% to 7% growth versus last year, despite a negative currency impact of approximately 11 percentage points. What is the previous guide, our updated guidance includes improved underlying business performance of $0.14 offset by $0.24 of higher FX headwind. At current FX rates, we estimate the full-year FX impact on 2023 to be a year-over-year headwind of 2% to 3% on sales and 4% to 5% on adjusted EPS. FX impact is expected to be largely concentrated in the first half of 2023 at current rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 8 percentage points resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of minus 2% to 0%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.66 to $3.76, which is flat to 3% higher than prior year's quarter, despite negative currency impact of approximately 15 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it [Technical Difficulty] summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. In summary, we're very pleased with our performance. Demand has continued to be robust across our resilient end markets and geographies. This together with our strong commercial execution and refreshed portfolio is allowing us to consistently deliver excellent results. Once again, we're raising our full-year sales guidance from a prior range of 9.5% to 10.%, now to 11.5% to 12%. In closing, I would like to point out that our 2022 ESG report will be released next week. At Waters, we're proud to have been widely recognized as an ESG leader. We believe that we all have a part to play in leading the world better than we found it from decreasing our environmental footprint to becoming more representative of the society we live in. This year we've made further progress towards our goals, delivering approximately 60% of our electricity from renewable or low carbon sources. We launched the Water Student Academy and are partnering with three historically black colleges and universities to provide STEM education and career opportunities. We also conducted broad stakeholder engagement in our comprehensive materiality assessment. We are proud that our new state-of-the-art chemical manufacturing facility in Taunton, Massachusetts was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as the only lead certified facility of its kind in the state and among the small number in the United States. While there is always more work to be done in ESG, I'm proud of the progress we've made. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: We are now ready to begin our formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is coming from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Congrats on a really strong print share. Udit, maybe my first one for you on this revenue outperformance in the Q, big picture when you look at the state of end markets, whether it's a pharma CapEx environment, replacement cycle or industrial, you know, perhaps macro situation. Talk about the big drivers here on what's happening and whether any of these drivers should change for \u201823?\nUdit Batra: Sure. So Vijay, firstly, thank you. Look, from a demand perspective, I mean, we are operating in very resilient end markets, right? I mean, starting with pharma, which is 60% of our business. And I'll remind you that we are more levered to late stage development and QA/QC. Pharma continues to grow and even if there is a downturn, people don't stop consuming medicines, right? So I think that we believe is a very strong place to be. Second is our industrial business, which over the years has transformed and is heavily focused on our food and environmental and increasingly the TA business on battery testing and the need for safe food, clean water, especially with PFAs testing, as well as battery testing is our salient drivers. So roughly 80% of our business is levered towards, I would say, resilient end markets. Now in those rather resilient growing end markets, I think there are water specific drivers that I'd like to point out that gave us confidence in continued outperformance, right? So if you just simply start with our commercial initiatives, right? I mean, we see those continuing to add value over the next couple of years, be it instrument replacement, be it e-commerce, which is well over 30% now from a 20% starting point for our consumables revenue. But we think we're going to end up north of 55% over the next few years. CDMO footprint has increased quite nicely over the -- on a stacked basis over the last two to three years that, that portion of the business has grown double the rate of the overall business, almost 20%. So we think our commercial initiatives have run way number one in these strong markets. Second, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, innovation is really contributing well to our growth. And that is a driver that will continue to contribute, right? I mean, starting with pharma, we of course talk about our Arc HPLC, but then what gives me even more confidence is our increased focus on biologics, right? And that is one of the most salient drivers of growth for pharma. Over 30% of our pharma business now is levered towards large molecules with now the launch of MaxPeak premier columns, now increasingly focused on the MassSpec business. I remember when I joined, folks told me what is going to do about the MassSpec business, then two years later, I mean, you see strong, strong outperformance in our MassSpec business. I mean, instruments grew this quarter 21%, MassSpec almost touched 40% with Xevo TQ Absolute really solving problems for our customers in detecting increasingly low quantities of PFAs. So the MassSpec portfolio is contributing very nicely to the growth of the business. I can go on the innovation side, but I feel very good about where we stand from an innovation standpoint. And then finally, the third specific driver for Waters is our adjacencies. I pointed out the increased traction we have for BioAccord, not just in QA/QC, but upstream in clone selection in selection of and detection of raw materials for bioprocessing and there's a lot of traction for simplified LCMS in -- from our customers. And finally, despite the, sort of, turbulent environment, be it rolling shutdowns, due to COVID in China or the geopolitical challenges in Europe, we've been able to navigate through these extremely well. So that gives me confidence that from a macro perspective in these resilient end markets, I mean, what does this commercial execution, really now supported by strong innovation and increased traction in our adjacencies gives me a lot of confidence that in the future, we'll see even more robust performance. And really, I mean, I'll end here. Look, faster instrument growth and don't ask me when this slows down, it looks really good. Orders were again higher than sales. This looks really good, but it bodes well for what we see in the future for our consumables business, especially service which we've been focusing on a lot. So I hope that gives you clarity on why we have so much confidence and we raised the full-year guidance, as well on constant currency growth.\nVijay Kumar: Really that's helpful, Udit. And maybe one quick one for you, when you look at the margin performance, inflation, FX and mix were the main three components. When you look at \u201823, should we expect any perhaps some margin expansion? I know FX is a headwind not sure how to think about the impact of inflation on the margins and in mix?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, Vijay, look, I mean, on the gross margin line that are sort of four vectors that are playing out, right? There is FX, there is a higher instrument mix, there is new product launches, and then there is the pricing inflation dynamics that I just discussed. And each of these vectors are going to be accretive in driving gross margin expansion in the times to come. I mean, on the FX side, we really feel excited about the fact that despite this headwind, the business has rallied to find ways to offset the impact of exchange rate. And when the exchange rates normalize, you will see a much more pronounced impact on the margin, because of the resilience that has already played out in our 2022 numbers. On the instrument mix, I mean, it's a great problem to have. While this instrument growth is creating somewhat of a headwind on the margin today, it is going to drive accretive recurring gross margin growth from chemistry and service in the future. We've seen also great growth from our new products and it sort of underscores that innovation matters in this space. But as you can understand, anytime when you launch new products, they haven't gone through the typical value engineering cycle that they go at Waters like we've gone through with Alliance. And we will see that play out on the gross margin of these newer products in the coming years. And then the last piece is the pricing inflation dynamics, right? And there, the pricing gains are systemic, we've built muscle in terms of systems and processes to drive pricing gains more than what we have historically driven, which was 50 basis points to 75 basis points. And on the other hand, a lot of inflation is spot buys. And as the electronic component market, sort of, normalizes, some of this spot buy pressure will go away again providing tailwind to the gross margin. So overall, I mean, we are still on track where we say, look, I mean, we will have about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the underlying business between volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. And we will reinvest 70 basis points to 80 basis points of those gains in nurturing our higher growth adjacencies in the near-term.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Brennan of Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for Udit, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just as a jumping off point as we kind of look ahead, you just kind of addressed a little bit of the margin drivers. I know at the Investor Day you talked about \u201923, still feel good about mid single-digit plus. I'm just wondering, doesn't sound like anything has really changed, but just wondering is that still the right zip code as we sit here today, which would imply a three-year stack acceleration from what you're doing? And then kind of related to the prior question given the FX headwind that you're talking about for next year, three to four points, it would imply kind of modest top line growth. So in a modest top line growth environment, kind of, what's the ability to expand margin in \u201923 if that's fair?\nUdit Batra: So Dan, firstly, thank you for your question. Look, I'll start and then I'll pass over to Amol. The 5% to 7% we talked about those in a different context, right? I mean, from a constant currency -- on a constant currency basis, I mean, we\u2019ve been clocking well ahead of that, as you know, right? So year-to-date, I mean, you see it close to 14% growth on a three-year stack basis, it's almost a double-digit growth, slightly shy of a double-digit growth. So we're really well ahead of that. And that's not just strong end markets, but also really strong execution of our commercial initiatives, which still have some legs over the next year -- next couple of years. We're seeing innovation really starting to contribute meaningfully to this growth of course, helping with the instrument replacement, but also improving our biologics footprint. And then finally, our adjacencies are also starting to contribute especially the bioanalytical characterization and the battery testing initiatives. So we feel very good about where we sit today. In terms of what we expect for 2023, there'll be ample time to discuss that in our Q4 earnings and there's a bit more data to be collected before the year-end, as you can imagine, in such a turbulent environment we want to take our time to think through what that will look like. But sitting here today, we feel very good about what we've told you in the past in terms of drivers, wherever the market is. You can assume that our commercial execution will add on top of it. Second, innovation is really meeting the unmet needs in the market. And third, our adjacencies are starting to contribute especially to Biologics and the batteries part. So feel very good about where we sit more to come in Q4. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. And then covering on the margin, right? So I think at this stage, we feel really good about where each of our initiatives are? I mean, our volume leverage is working with a strong instrument growth this year, we think that will have an accretive mix impact on the recurring revenue, bringing better gross margin profile next year. We do see, sort of, the level of spot buys slowing down and we have gained a lot of confidence and comfort in the systems and processes that we've implemented for pricing. So all of that will enable us to stay on the track that we outlined at our Investor Day, which is still roughly 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion with a 70 basis points to 80 basis points of reinvestment in higher growth adjacencies.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just a follow-up on instruments. Obviously, you spent a fair amount of time already, but we'd love to sort of expand, but I mean, the 40% MassSpec growth is just very notable and the 21%, the 10% three-year stack is really strong. So maybe could you just step back, Udit, and as you look at all the adjacency opportunity, new innovation opportunity, like what's the right way as we look ahead on the durability of kind of instrument growth for Waters?\nUdit Batra: It\u2019s a fantastic question, near and dear to my heart. Look, I have made it a point to go to many of the conferences that, that many of the technical conferences like the AAPS, this is the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientist, where I went recently the Bioprocess International, the AACR just to talk to customers directly and not just drink our own Cool Aid. And I can tell you our MassSpec portfolio is solving fairly significant unmet needs across the portfolio. Now we've talked about LC in the past, Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier, what they do for especially ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier columns? What they do for biologics testing? On the MassSpec side, you can go across the portfolio. High res portfolio, our cyclic IMS, is the only instrument that is able to analyze molecules by shape and size, which is quite an important attribute to have as you're looking at larger molecules and that's direct feedback from our -- from some of our top customers. And Cyclic has been doing very well recently. The MRT, which we launched recently, the multi reflecting ToF is in its early innings. We've also got the license for Charge Detection MassSpec. And we feel very good about our IRS portfolio as a consequence. Second, the application of tandem quartz, this is sort of the workhorse instruments in the industry, right? I mean, I already talked about Xevo TQ Absolute and the Waters Connect Black -- Waters Connect software that we developed for our Xevo TQXS, which is the food -- which is level towards the food testing environment. This is a very deliberate effort, Dan, right? I mean, the challenges in environmental testing with increasing the sensitive, increasing amount of sensitivity required for PFAs testing is something that's known to all of us and it's an unmet need across all geographies and we are just seeing the start of that on build up. So we expect that to grow very nicely over the next couple of years. Second, on the food testing side, our customers came to us and said, look, we want to be able to do our testing faster and quantitative faster and the Waters Connect platform, especially with MASK-1, with the MASK-1 application speeds up the process by 50% again, a very deliberate focus on unmet needs for our customers. And then finally, we've talked about BioAccord, which was initially launched in the QA/QC environment. Of course, it has traction as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with several large pharmaceutical companies, but not just in QA/QC, now for clone selection with our collaboration with Sartorius, Wwe've already placed several instruments and there's a very large number of seeds out there and we think the seed conversion is going to be pretty high in this case for a clone selection, and we have seen increasingly customers use it to test raw materials against something I pointed out in my prepared remarks. And again, the pipeline of pharmaceuticals is roughly 40% towards large molecules. And the use of a simplified LCMS method with create great workflows is something that we expect to contribute to for many, many years to come. So across the portfolio and I'm really focused on elaborating on MassSpec now, we've talked about LC in the past. We feel extremely, extremely good about what it's doing in the pharma space for towards biologics, but also how it's helping us revive the growth in food and environmental and the academic segments. Thank you for the question, I could go on forever, I mean, being an engineer, I can get into a lot more details, but I think this is -- I'll stop here and I hope that gives you some flavor of why we're so confident about what we're doing.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Sykes, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. Udit maybe the first question just on China, it seems that for you and others that China lockdowns have been less impactful this time around than previously. Could you maybe talk about what has changed there? Is it just where the lockdowns are occurring? Or if you change the way that you're managing that business over there to adjust to that type of environment? So should we expect maybe less volatility in China going forward?\nUdit Batra: Matt, it's an excellent question. Something that we think about and talk about a lot in our team. Look, make no mistake there are rolling lockdowns across China going on even now. That said, we have as I mentioned previously, we have a very strong leadership in China that we brought in over the last couple of years. And we've managed to navigate these lockdowns really well. And I hope -- and I think that's not going to change over the next few quarters as this continues. Now just looking at the facts, I mean, year-to-date, China is going roughly 16%, I mean, this quarter was roughly 23% and the growth -- and again, I focus more on now what is specific factors. I mean, the growth is driven by our strong commercial execution, the instrument replacement driven by our Arc HPLC. And now MassSpec has contributed to the revival of the academic segment where the business has almost doubled and the industrial segment as well, right? So been very good about what we're doing across end markets, not just in pharma. Our contract manufacturing initiative has done extremely well. And we started in China with strong growth with a biologics manufacturer, biologics contract manufacturer there. The commercial execution has been going extremely well in China. Innovation is contributing like everywhere else geographically. The MassSpec tandem quad portfolio has again helped us grow the food and environmental and the electronics testing market. And then finally, as we look ahead, we feel that the fact that we've been able to navigate through these ups and downs gives us a lot of confidence as things ease up that we will continue to accelerate in China. So China remains a strong growth market for us. We feel very good with the leadership we've had and the execution we've had that we can manage the volatility that we've seen so far.\nAmol Chaubal: And good to add to that, Matt, right? For Q3, China benefited with a lower baseline, because of the $12 million shipment delay last year, so that's about 10 percentage points of growth. But at the same time, they did have a headwind from some of the newer lockdowns, so one has to keep that in mind. And as Udit outlined, you know, for us, the team is executing really well and working towards a mid-teens growth profile for the year.\nMatt Sykes: Great. And thanks for that, and then just one quick one for you, Amol. Just on inventory, there's obviously a lot of focus on the customer side inventories. But as you think about your own inventory, can you think about the potential visibility of demand as we go into \u201923 and it still could be somewhat uncertain? How are you thinking about building your own inventories to solve for the supply chain constraints that still exist, but also for maybe a more uncertain demand environment in \u201823?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So I mean, what we've done is we've looked at sort of our product profile and we've gone through bill of materials for pretty much every product and gone through secondary and tertiary supply chains and identified hotspots where a certain component that travels through the supply chain is sort of in shortage. And there, we've gone deep to build relationships with the primary supplier and have secured quantities that will last us for longer than usual times, right? And where possible we have built alternative supplies especially for electronic components and where possible we will also build geographical diversification. So you're sort of not stuck in a lockdown in China or in a place where you have a sole source. Now that has put some pressure on inventory, because we've sort of accumulated this inventory in preparation for the demand that we are seeing on the instrument side and in preparation for potential supply disruptions that may be caused by COVID or other sort of macroeconomic events. But at this point, we feel really good where supply chain stands, right, progressively a lot of the yellows have been resolved and things are sort of between green and yellow on most of the items.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Luke Sergott of Barclays. And your line is open.\nLuke Sergott: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question or questions, can you dig in here what you're seeing on the CDMO side, there's been a lot of mixed signals coming from peers and also CDMOs themselves. Can you just give us a sense of how you guys are seeing that market shake out and what your -- how you're factoring that in as you start planning for next year?\nUdit Batra: Luke, thanks for the question. Look, I mnea, let me just start with some context and then I'll answer your question, right? I mean, when we started our transformation process CDMOs were, I would say, less than 20% of our pharma business. And we worked -- and this is, as you know, one of the most dynamic segments for the pharma business. Over the last couple of years, we worked extremely hard to build tools, systems, processes and go after that customer segment. And the growth in that segment over the last two years has been double the dynamic growth that you see, right? So if you see our three year stacked growth number, it's almost double-digit, it's about 9%. CDMO growth has been close to 20% right? So the overall demand for us and our value proposition in that market has been recognized very widely. And the value proposition I'll remind you is not just one of pricing and giving better lease terms, it's actually a technical value proposition, meaning as more complex molecules are transferred from pharma and others into CDMO, our scientists are working hand in hand with our CDMO customers to help them transfer those processes from the Pfizer and the Merck\u2019s and the AstraZeneca\u2019s of the world. So the value proposition is recognized, we've done extremely well so far. And yes, we're following the volatility in the CDMO market. Now I'll give you an example, right? So global CDMOs like any other multi-national have global footprints now, right? And if there is a geopolitical driven volatility, for instance, either in China or in the United States, what we are seeing is if any of our customers, CDMO customers is starting to look at diversifying their footprint, they're coming to us and saying, hey, I'm no longer going to expand my facility, as an example, in China or no longer going to do it in the U.S., I'm going to actually diversify to Ireland or diversify to Singapore they come to us first. And so for us, the overall demand given our deep relationships with our top customers in the CDMO space, has not fluctuated, right? So we find that to be a very strong growth segment for us. It might just shift geographically given all the geopolitical challenges that are occurring. And with a lot of repatriation, our CDMO customers are diversifying. So hope that clarifies why we still remain confident that while individual geographies might suffer a little bit. We pick up the volume in other geographies. And by and large, none of our customers have come back so far and said, hey, we want to slowdown.\nLuke Sergott: Okay, great. And then you talked about service a little bit. And as you guys continue to drive a lot of strong instrument growth, can you update us on how much you've expanded your installed base? And then talk about the service attach rates? And what's driving part of your strong service growth? Is it more about just placing new boxes? Or is it also driving that incremental service revenue per instrument?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So let me start and then I'll hand it over to Amol. So we had started with the aspiration, Luke of increasing our service attachment rates by and it's already industry leading. We wanted to expand it by about 1,000 basis points, meaning 10 percentage points. We've already done 200 basis points so far in the last year and a half or so. We still see a long runway of increasing our attach rates and this is through many different tactics, right? So quoting at the point of sale, having automated renewal, and several other tactics that I won't discuss openly due to competitive reasons. We feel extremely good about the increasing attach rates for any installed base that we have. Now with such terrific instrument growth with LC, with MassSpec double-digit over on a stack basis, I mean 21% year-to-date, soorry 19% year-to-date, 21% for the quarter. We feel very good that we should see that flow through in the service business over the next few years. I know Amol is super enthusiastic about this and he gets very analytical with our teams and says, you've grown your base this much, your service should go up this much. I'll let him comment a little bit.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Luke, I mean, it's a great question. And the way we look at it is, let's say, when you grow instruments by 21% your installed base doesn't grow by 21%, right? Because the installed base on an average is, let's say, seven years, and so you get a 3% bump if all these instruments were new placements. But close to 70% or 80% of them are replacements. So they are sort of not adding to the installed base, the new ones are. But also on the ones that you replace, you expect higher utilization at least on chemistry. So all of these become available to what you can drive your recurring revenue on. And as we've pointed out on service, we've been very successful 200 basis points last year and this year, we said we would do 100 basis points and we already did 100 basis points in the first half of the year. And again, there one has to think not all of it is incremental revenue, because these customers are already buying spare parts from us outside of the plants. So the incremental revenue is sort of a fraction of what the attachment rate would bring. But overall, with this great instrument growth, we feel really excited how much recurring revenue we can drive both on chemistry, as well as on service in the years to come.\nUdit Batra: Yes. And just to sort of summarize, Luke, the simplest way to think about it is if we replace 100 instruments, 20 to 30, closer to 30 these days are new customers and new users, right? And they will then convert into service revenue, de novo service revenue, add on top better service performance with increased attachment rates gives us confidence that the increased installed base, especially the newer ones are going to add incrementally to service growth over the coming years. And of course, consumables attachment is an added benefit.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Okay, thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. So first off here, I mean, we've had a few of your peers just talk about changing in ordering patterns from customers throughout various end markets. Just as supply chain constraints have slowed down, so you're seeing customers returning back to normalized ordering patterns. So just wondering if you've seen anything in line with that across any of your end markets, earning a no shift in those ordering patterns from your customers so far?\nUdit Batra: Rachel, on the orders to sales ratio, right? So our orders have again grown more than the sales this particular quarter. So orders were higher than sales. Again we have not seen, I would say, any sort of significant change in order patterns so far this year. I mean, it's a very robust pipeline, we're very -- and again, I'll remind you, I mean, we're not dealing with volatile end markets. Close to 80% of our end markets are highly, highly resilient. Second, our products are very innovative, right? I mean, we are now meeting unmet needs for our customers, right? So we don't expect customers to stop ordering the Xevo TQ Absolute, because they need it and it's the most sensitive instrument in the space for testing PFAs. We don't expect customers to stop ordering Xevo TQ XS with Waters Connect, because it's 50% faster than any competitive instrument in terms of analysis. We don't expect them to stop ordering ACQUITY Premier or Arc HPLC given the benefits that they get. So innovative products in resilient demand segments don't seem to be impacted by what you are pointing out. So we are not seeing any of that. And I think it could be a water specific thing. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, the demand overall is good, but we also think we are doing some specific things, which are deliberately improving our traction with our customers, especially from an innovation standpoint.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then just a follow-up here on M&A, can you just talk about how the pipeline is looking? And then anecdotally, we've heard that those private valuations on the private side of things have still remained high? So what have you seen from that and kind of what's the latest timeline for when you think that you could maybe get a deal done here? And then finally, what type of leverage range would you be willing to reach for the right size deal in any of those high growth adjacent markets that you flagged?\nUdit Batra: Sure, Rachel. I mean, M&A is something we're thinking about quite regularly, right? I mean, but I\u2019ll just remind you sort of our overall capital allocation priorities, right? I mean growth is the imperative, we're seeing tremendous organic growth and that remains the number one priority. I mean, we'll invest in CapEx and OpEx as Amol mentioned earlier about 80 basis points even in this environment to support our growth ambitions. We feel extremely good about that. Second, to support the growth, we're looking at M&A opportunities and the pipeline is very robust, not just in the adjacencies, but also in the coal. In some areas they are richer than others, of course, you can imagine I can't comment more specifically on it. And if we don't find something that is financially reasonable and sensible, will of course continue to do buybacks as we've done in the past. But growth remains the priority. As far as timing is concerned, that's always better to comment in the rearview mirror. Amol, do you want to talk about the leverage ratios?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean, in general, our thinking is, first of all, we want to be absolutely financially disciplined and make sure that on a risk adjusted basis any transaction creates value for our shareholders. And then in terms of financing, we want to stay investment grade as much as possible or even lower. So that the interest rates have gone up and that can create a dilutive impact on EPS accretion. But as long as we are sort of within investment grade, we should be able to thread the needle.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to ask one for you, Udit, I think you specifically said one asked me when this is going to slowdown, but I still kind of have to go there first. Can you maybe try to parse out some of the components of the growth? I mean, we hear you on the innovation, we hear you on, sort of, the robust markets, but still these are really impressive results quarter-after-quarter. So any additional clarity to get maybe, kind of, rank ordering, share gains versus replacement cycle versus how much is new lab construction or new end markets? You spent a lot of time talking about PFAs and how that's becoming more and more prominent? So just maybe going through and saying where you -- what are you seeing as the biggest contributors to the step up in growth? And that will hopefully give us a little more clarity and how durable this will be going forward?\nUdit Batra: So Michael, I can give you the algorithm, and I'm going to disappoint you that I'm not going to give you very, very deep specifics on each of these. So just to review the drivers, right? First, I mean, the end markets that we serve are resilient and robust, as you know, right? So 80% as I've talked repeatedly are pretty robust and we feel good about the resiliency of these end markets. Now whatever that number is historically been X and now it's definitely X plus delta X, some of it driven by volume and some of it also driven by increased pricing, right? So take that as a starting point. Then from a Water specific standpoint, there are three different contributors. We had said at our Analyst Day about 100 basis points, you can expect probably a bit higher this particular year from our commercial initiatives, instrument replacement, CDMO, service, as well as e-commerce, all of those are contributing quite handsomely and so definitely north of 100 hundred basis points this year. What we're seeing very nicely now dovetailed into that is the second independent driver, which is innovation, right? And I took some time today and I\u2019ve -- and we had a big debate internally how much we should elaborate, but I felt it was necessary given the questions that I think you guys have asked on the durability of growth. Innovation is really, really contributing already significantly, right? MaxPeak Premier fastest launch in Waters' history in terms of columns. And we've been launching columns since 1970 and some of them are still in the market and this one's done better than anything they\u2019ve launched. Second, the MassSpec portfolio is totally revived and we're definitely in the early innings of extraction. PFAs testing is a significant need for water testing and we have the best instrument in class. So really feel good about that and we didn't talk much about TA today, right? But TA has also revitalized innovation with our powder rheology instrument that test powders that go into coating, anodes and cathodes for battery testing. So feel extremely good about it, I won't give you a number, I mean, likely in Q4, we can comment looking backwards on what the contribution has been from innovation, but innovation is contributing handsomely. The adjacencies now, again, a question that I think several of you've asked, how good is attraction? I took some time today to talk about BioAccord, I mean, the same thing we see with batteries. We're starting to see with LCMS, I was at the AACR, this is the American Association of Clinical Research in Chicago with the team and there's a strong demand from our spec for early disease detection in the clinical space. So again, the different adjacencies are starting to contribute. And remember, we said that they will more meaningfully contribute beyond 2024, but we're already starting to see them contribute. And that I think overall explains the beyond market performance. And I think, again, we took some time to give you the three-year stacked growth rate, because I mean short-term changes quarter-on-quarter can sort of dilute the outperformance. But if you look at it on a stack basis, on a two to three year basis, we're outperforming quite significantly the peer group. So I hope that gives you clarity and helps you think through how the demand is going to shape up for the coming years.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session for today's call.\nUdit Batra: Thank you.\nOperator: And this will conclude our conference for today. All parties may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We continue to deliver excellent results in the third quarter with very strong growth across our product portfolio, our end markets and geographies. This was led by instrument growth of more than 20%. Similar to previous quarters, orders again outpaced sales. A result like this takes an exceptional effort and dedication from all our colleagues. We are very proud of what our teams continue to consistently deliver. Today, we have three key messages to share, which reflect the ongoing strength and exciting drivers of our business: first, we are consistently delivering strong commercial execution. Our transformation has become embedded in how we operate with a relentless focus on commercial excellence. You can see this in our results. Second, innovation at Waters is back. It's delivering across our portfolio and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refreshed product portfolio is answering our customers' unmet needs across a variety of applications. Adoption rates for new instruments have been impressive and are driving market share gains. Thirdly, our growth initiatives are gaining traction. We continue to make measurable progress on our high growth adjacencies and have proof points that are giving us confidence. Turning now to our third quarter results, our revenue grew 7% as reported and 15% on a constant currency basis. We saw broad strength across our end markets and geographies with robust demand from our customers. Growth in the quarter was led by industrial and academic and government, which both grew over 20% and pharma, which grew 9%. Each of our regions grew double digits. China grew over 20%, India grew 20%, Europe grew mid-teens and the U.S. grew 11%. Instruments grew over 20% with our LC, mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Mass spec growth was very strong at almost 40%. Recurring revenues grew 10% supported by our growth initiatives in e-commerce and service attachment. Our Q3 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.64, this is roughly flat year-over-year despite FX headwinds of 13%. Now looking at our year-to-date performance. We're executing well throughout the organization despite a tough macroeconomic environment. Our strength has been broad-based across our geographies and end markets, each of which are up double-digits this year. Pharma is up 12%, industrial is up 15% and academic and government is up 16%. Instrument growth has been very strong throughout the year, growing 19% year-to-date, led by the U.S. at almost 30%. We expect this to drive future growth in our recurring revenues. Our transformation has allowed us to consistently deliver excellent results. Our three year CAGR underscores the momentum we've built across our business. Year-to-date, we've delivered 9% three-year stack growth overall on a constant currency basis. Moving on to our second key message, Innovation. Waters has long been known as an innovation leader. Our investments in innovation are again driving results and contributing meaningfully to our growth. Sales of Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and Max Premier columns again doubled in the quarter versus the previous year. Our new products are solving problems that matter to our customers supported by our technical strength and strong commercial execution. Arc HPLC is driving customers to upgrade their LC fleets used for routine small molecule analysis. This is advancing customer lab capabilities and productivity, while accelerating the cadence of instrument replacement. Our MaxPeak Premier technology separates complex molecules like biologics. By eliminating the need for passivation, MaxPeak columns can get scientist answers up to 20 times faster than their non-premier equivalent. They also give sharper peaks with 12 times the sensitivity when separating oligonucleotides as an example. The customer benefits around Premier are very compelling. This has resulted in significant large molecule growth in recent quarters, which now accounts for over 30% of our pharma revenues versus 20% just a few years ago. Today, Biologics represents 20% of the pharmaceutical market, but account for 40% of the R&D pipeline positioning us very well for future growth. With our cyclic ion mobility separation high resolution MassSpec, cyclic IMS for short, scientists can separate molecules by shape, as well as mass due to the combination of iron mobility with time of flight. This is providing customers with amplified resolution and clarity. Demand has ramped up for cyclic within Omics research for lipids, proteins and metabolites, all exciting areas within early disease detection and discovery. As an example, the largest privately funded MassSpec troriomics facility in Canada has been using Cyclic for antibody sequencing and discovery. They're impressed with the quality of data that Cyclic has provided supporting their lab at the forefront of scientific discovery. Also within Massspec, we're seeing great traction for our recently launched Xevo TQ Absolute. It has seen strong demand in food and environmental applications led by Per and polyfluonated compound testing. The PFAs testing market has seen rapid growth in recent months, driven by increased surveillance testing and newly added compounds of interest. We see this as a multiyear growth opportunity. In June of this year, the U.S. EPA announced new drinking water health advisories for the four most notorious PFAs compounds setting measurement levels finer than parts per billion. TQ Absolute is so sensitive, it can detect PFAs at one part or quadrillion. This is less than a grain of sand in an Olympic sized swimming pool. TQ Absolute's ability to quantity lower bundles molecules is beyond anything on the market and gives us the right to win in this space. Since launching TQ Absolute, we won competitive placement for PFAs testing across every region. In one example, a large global testing organization is using it for infant food and water testing in Southeast Asia. This customer is developing a new set of methods that can be used for routine testing across workflows in their organization. Within informatics, Waters Connect is enabling exciting new analytical areas in large molecule analysis. On instruments like the G3 Qtof and BioAccord. This includes cell culture media analysis, peptide mapping and oligonucleotide characterization. There is a lot of long-term potential in these areas given demand for stability, quality and impurity analysis. The characterization of biologics and novel modalities allows these molecules to move downstream into routine QA, QC workflows. Additionally at TA, we have added new powder rheology capabilities to our portfolio. This is to support the strong growth we're seeing in battery-related applications. Powders are critical to anode and cathode manufacturing allowing battery producers to better screen electrode coatings and solvent free dry coatings helps ensures optimal performance, prevent defects and reduce cell failure rates. According to industry sources, in the next 10 years, production of lithium ion batteries is expected to grow ten-fold. Demand is expected to exceed 4,000 gigawatt hours per year by 2032, driven by electric vehicles and energy storage. As battery volume scale RTA instrument portfolio is well positioned to support an expanding set of testing demands within the battery development and safety analysis space. One of our European customers, a fast growing Scandinavian battery producer, uses our rheumators to test incoming materials for critical electrode components. This company has tripled its purchases of DA instruments this year, reflecting not only its own growth, but the confidence they have in our technology and support as they scale their operations. I would now like to share some of the recent progress we've made in our -- towards a high growth adjacencies as our third key message. Since time is limited, I will only focus on Bioprocess Characterization. BioAccord offers a compelling value proposition to Bioprocess Engineers, it provides a paradigm shift in analytical capabilities for biologics manufacturing, which while being quick and easy to use. Through our collaboration with Sartorius, we have expanded the capabilities of BioAccord in this area. We can dramatically shorten clone selection times. We are also enabling improvements in tighter and yields, which can reduce COGS. Our value proposition is resonating amongst industry leaders. At the recent Bioprocess International Conference in Boston, which I attended personally, AstraZeneca publicly highlighted the benefits of implementing online process analytical technology using the BioAccord monitoring to monitor drug substance and cell culture media. Meanwhile, Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies are already using it to monitor vital components during cell culture production and for analysis of raw materials used in Bioprocessing. By fingerprinting components in Cell Culture Media using BioAccord, they are generating insights that can help streamline the manufacturing process. These are just a few of the early proof points we can share with you today for BioAccord. We're encouraged by the long-term opportunity we have to solve unmet needs in Bioprocess Characterization. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol? Thank you, Amol. In summary, we're very pleased with our performance. Demand has continued to be robust across our resilient end markets and geographies. This together with our strong commercial execution and refreshed portfolio is allowing us to consistently deliver excellent results. Once again, we're raising our full-year sales guidance from a prior range of 9.5% to 10.%, now to 11.5% to 12%. In closing, I would like to point out that our 2022 ESG report will be released next week. At Waters, we're proud to have been widely recognized as an ESG leader. We believe that we all have a part to play in leading the world better than we found it from decreasing our environmental footprint to becoming more representative of the society we live in. This year we've made further progress towards our goals, delivering approximately 60% of our electricity from renewable or low carbon sources. We launched the Water Student Academy and are partnering with three historically black colleges and universities to provide STEM education and career opportunities. We also conducted broad stakeholder engagement in our comprehensive materiality assessment. We are proud that our new state-of-the-art chemical manufacturing facility in Taunton, Massachusetts was recognized by the U.S. Green Building Council as the only lead certified facility of its kind in the state and among the small number in the United States. While there is always more work to be done in ESG, I'm proud of the progress we've made. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. Sure. So Vijay, firstly, thank you. Look, from a demand perspective, I mean, we are operating in very resilient end markets, right? I mean, starting with pharma, which is 60% of our business. And I'll remind you that we are more levered to late stage development and QA/QC. Pharma continues to grow and even if there is a downturn, people don't stop consuming medicines, right? So I think that we believe is a very strong place to be. Second is our industrial business, which over the years has transformed and is heavily focused on our food and environmental and increasingly the TA business on battery testing and the need for safe food, clean water, especially with PFAs testing, as well as battery testing is our salient drivers. So roughly 80% of our business is levered towards, I would say, resilient end markets. Now in those rather resilient growing end markets, I think there are water specific drivers that I'd like to point out that gave us confidence in continued outperformance, right? So if you just simply start with our commercial initiatives, right? I mean, we see those continuing to add value over the next couple of years, be it instrument replacement, be it e-commerce, which is well over 30% now from a 20% starting point for our consumables revenue. But we think we're going to end up north of 55% over the next few years. CDMO footprint has increased quite nicely over the -- on a stacked basis over the last two to three years that, that portion of the business has grown double the rate of the overall business, almost 20%. So we think our commercial initiatives have run way number one in these strong markets. Second, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, innovation is really contributing well to our growth. And that is a driver that will continue to contribute, right? I mean, starting with pharma, we of course talk about our Arc HPLC, but then what gives me even more confidence is our increased focus on biologics, right? And that is one of the most salient drivers of growth for pharma. Over 30% of our pharma business now is levered towards large molecules with now the launch of MaxPeak premier columns, now increasingly focused on the MassSpec business. I remember when I joined, folks told me what is going to do about the MassSpec business, then two years later, I mean, you see strong, strong outperformance in our MassSpec business. I mean, instruments grew this quarter 21%, MassSpec almost touched 40% with Xevo TQ Absolute really solving problems for our customers in detecting increasingly low quantities of PFAs. So the MassSpec portfolio is contributing very nicely to the growth of the business. I can go on the innovation side, but I feel very good about where we stand from an innovation standpoint. And then finally, the third specific driver for Waters is our adjacencies. I pointed out the increased traction we have for BioAccord, not just in QA/QC, but upstream in clone selection in selection of and detection of raw materials for bioprocessing and there's a lot of traction for simplified LCMS in -- from our customers. And finally, despite the, sort of, turbulent environment, be it rolling shutdowns, due to COVID in China or the geopolitical challenges in Europe, we've been able to navigate through these extremely well. So that gives me confidence that from a macro perspective in these resilient end markets, I mean, what does this commercial execution, really now supported by strong innovation and increased traction in our adjacencies gives me a lot of confidence that in the future, we'll see even more robust performance. And really, I mean, I'll end here. Look, faster instrument growth and don't ask me when this slows down, it looks really good. Orders were again higher than sales. This looks really good, but it bodes well for what we see in the future for our consumables business, especially service which we've been focusing on a lot. So I hope that gives you clarity on why we have so much confidence and we raised the full-year guidance, as well on constant currency growth. So Dan, firstly, thank you for your question. Look, I'll start and then I'll pass over to Amol. The 5% to 7% we talked about those in a different context, right? I mean, from a constant currency -- on a constant currency basis, I mean, we've been clocking well ahead of that, as you know, right? So year-to-date, I mean, you see it close to 14% growth on a three-year stack basis, it's almost a double-digit growth, slightly shy of a double-digit growth. So we're really well ahead of that. And that's not just strong end markets, but also really strong execution of our commercial initiatives, which still have some legs over the next year -- next couple of years. We're seeing innovation really starting to contribute meaningfully to this growth of course, helping with the instrument replacement, but also improving our biologics footprint. And then finally, our adjacencies are also starting to contribute especially the bioanalytical characterization and the battery testing initiatives. So we feel very good about where we sit today. In terms of what we expect for 2023, there'll be ample time to discuss that in our Q4 earnings and there's a bit more data to be collected before the year-end, as you can imagine, in such a turbulent environment we want to take our time to think through what that will look like. But sitting here today, we feel very good about what we've told you in the past in terms of drivers, wherever the market is. You can assume that our commercial execution will add on top of it. Second, innovation is really meeting the unmet needs in the market. And third, our adjacencies are starting to contribute especially to Biologics and the batteries part. So feel very good about where we sit more to come in Q4. Amol? It's a fantastic question, near and dear to my heart. Look, I have made it a point to go to many of the conferences that, that many of the technical conferences like the AAPS, this is the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientist, where I went recently the Bioprocess International, the AACR just to talk to customers directly and not just drink our own Cool Aid. And I can tell you our MassSpec portfolio is solving fairly significant unmet needs across the portfolio. Now we've talked about LC in the past, Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier, what they do for especially ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier columns? What they do for biologics testing? On the MassSpec side, you can go across the portfolio. High res portfolio, our cyclic IMS, is the only instrument that is able to analyze molecules by shape and size, which is quite an important attribute to have as you're looking at larger molecules and that's direct feedback from our -- from some of our top customers. And Cyclic has been doing very well recently. The MRT, which we launched recently, the multi reflecting ToF is in its early innings. We've also got the license for Charge Detection MassSpec. And we feel very good about our IRS portfolio as a consequence. Second, the application of tandem quartz, this is sort of the workhorse instruments in the industry, right? I mean, I already talked about Xevo TQ Absolute and the Waters Connect Black -- Waters Connect software that we developed for our Xevo TQXS, which is the food -- which is level towards the food testing environment. This is a very deliberate effort, Dan, right? I mean, the challenges in environmental testing with increasing the sensitive, increasing amount of sensitivity required for PFAs testing is something that's known to all of us and it's an unmet need across all geographies and we are just seeing the start of that on build up. So we expect that to grow very nicely over the next couple of years. Second, on the food testing side, our customers came to us and said, look, we want to be able to do our testing faster and quantitative faster and the Waters Connect platform, especially with MASK-1, with the MASK-1 application speeds up the process by 50% again, a very deliberate focus on unmet needs for our customers. And then finally, we've talked about BioAccord, which was initially launched in the QA/QC environment. Of course, it has traction as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, with several large pharmaceutical companies, but not just in QA/QC, now for clone selection with our collaboration with Sartorius, Wwe've already placed several instruments and there's a very large number of seeds out there and we think the seed conversion is going to be pretty high in this case for a clone selection, and we have seen increasingly customers use it to test raw materials against something I pointed out in my prepared remarks. And again, the pipeline of pharmaceuticals is roughly 40% towards large molecules. And the use of a simplified LCMS method with create great workflows is something that we expect to contribute to for many, many years to come. So across the portfolio and I'm really focused on elaborating on MassSpec now, we've talked about LC in the past. We feel extremely, extremely good about what it's doing in the pharma space for towards biologics, but also how it's helping us revive the growth in food and environmental and the academic segments. Thank you for the question, I could go on forever, I mean, being an engineer, I can get into a lot more details, but I think this is -- I'll stop here and I hope that gives you some flavor of why we're so confident about what we're doing. Matt, it's an excellent question. Something that we think about and talk about a lot in our team. Look, make no mistake there are rolling lockdowns across China going on even now. That said, we have as I mentioned previously, we have a very strong leadership in China that we brought in over the last couple of years. And we've managed to navigate these lockdowns really well. And I hope -- and I think that's not going to change over the next few quarters as this continues. Now just looking at the facts, I mean, year-to-date, China is going roughly 16%, I mean, this quarter was roughly 23% and the growth -- and again, I focus more on now what is specific factors. I mean, the growth is driven by our strong commercial execution, the instrument replacement driven by our Arc HPLC. And now MassSpec has contributed to the revival of the academic segment where the business has almost doubled and the industrial segment as well, right? So been very good about what we're doing across end markets, not just in pharma. Our contract manufacturing initiative has done extremely well. And we started in China with strong growth with a biologics manufacturer, biologics contract manufacturer there. The commercial execution has been going extremely well in China. Innovation is contributing like everywhere else geographically. The MassSpec tandem quad portfolio has again helped us grow the food and environmental and the electronics testing market. And then finally, as we look ahead, we feel that the fact that we've been able to navigate through these ups and downs gives us a lot of confidence as things ease up that we will continue to accelerate in China. So China remains a strong growth market for us. We feel very good with the leadership we've had and the execution we've had that we can manage the volatility that we've seen so far. Luke, thanks for the question. Look, I mnea, let me just start with some context and then I'll answer your question, right? I mean, when we started our transformation process CDMOs were, I would say, less than 20% of our pharma business. And we worked -- and this is, as you know, one of the most dynamic segments for the pharma business. Over the last couple of years, we worked extremely hard to build tools, systems, processes and go after that customer segment. And the growth in that segment over the last two years has been double the dynamic growth that you see, right? So if you see our three year stacked growth number, it's almost double-digit, it's about 9%. CDMO growth has been close to 20% right? So the overall demand for us and our value proposition in that market has been recognized very widely. And the value proposition I'll remind you is not just one of pricing and giving better lease terms, it's actually a technical value proposition, meaning as more complex molecules are transferred from pharma and others into CDMO, our scientists are working hand in hand with our CDMO customers to help them transfer those processes from the Pfizer and the Merck's and the AstraZeneca's of the world. So the value proposition is recognized, we've done extremely well so far. And yes, we're following the volatility in the CDMO market. Now I'll give you an example, right? So global CDMOs like any other multi-national have global footprints now, right? And if there is a geopolitical driven volatility, for instance, either in China or in the United States, what we are seeing is if any of our customers, CDMO customers is starting to look at diversifying their footprint, they're coming to us and saying, hey, I'm no longer going to expand my facility, as an example, in China or no longer going to do it in the U.S., I'm going to actually diversify to Ireland or diversify to Singapore they come to us first. And so for us, the overall demand given our deep relationships with our top customers in the CDMO space, has not fluctuated, right? So we find that to be a very strong growth segment for us. It might just shift geographically given all the geopolitical challenges that are occurring. And with a lot of repatriation, our CDMO customers are diversifying. So hope that clarifies why we still remain confident that while individual geographies might suffer a little bit. We pick up the volume in other geographies. And by and large, none of our customers have come back so far and said, hey, we want to slowdown. Yes. So let me start and then I'll hand it over to Amol. So we had started with the aspiration, Luke of increasing our service attachment rates by and it's already industry leading. We wanted to expand it by about 1,000 basis points, meaning 10 percentage points. We've already done 200 basis points so far in the last year and a half or so. We still see a long runway of increasing our attach rates and this is through many different tactics, right? So quoting at the point of sale, having automated renewal, and several other tactics that I won't discuss openly due to competitive reasons. We feel extremely good about the increasing attach rates for any installed base that we have. Now with such terrific instrument growth with LC, with MassSpec double-digit over on a stack basis, I mean 21% year-to-date, soorry 19% year-to-date, 21% for the quarter. We feel very good that we should see that flow through in the service business over the next few years. I know Amol is super enthusiastic about this and he gets very analytical with our teams and says, you've grown your base this much, your service should go up this much. I'll let him comment a little bit. Yes. And just to sort of summarize, Luke, the simplest way to think about it is if we replace 100 instruments, 20 to 30, closer to 30 these days are new customers and new users, right? And they will then convert into service revenue, de novo service revenue, add on top better service performance with increased attachment rates gives us confidence that the increased installed base, especially the newer ones are going to add incrementally to service growth over the coming years. And of course, consumables attachment is an added benefit. Rachel, on the orders to sales ratio, right? So our orders have again grown more than the sales this particular quarter. So orders were higher than sales. Again we have not seen, I would say, any sort of significant change in order patterns so far this year. I mean, it's a very robust pipeline, we're very -- and again, I'll remind you, I mean, we're not dealing with volatile end markets. Close to 80% of our end markets are highly, highly resilient. Second, our products are very innovative, right? I mean, we are now meeting unmet needs for our customers, right? So we don't expect customers to stop ordering the Xevo TQ Absolute, because they need it and it's the most sensitive instrument in the space for testing PFAs. We don't expect customers to stop ordering Xevo TQ XS with Waters Connect, because it's 50% faster than any competitive instrument in terms of analysis. We don't expect them to stop ordering ACQUITY Premier or Arc HPLC given the benefits that they get. So innovative products in resilient demand segments don't seem to be impacted by what you are pointing out. So we are not seeing any of that. And I think it could be a water specific thing. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, the demand overall is good, but we also think we are doing some specific things, which are deliberately improving our traction with our customers, especially from an innovation standpoint. Sure, Rachel. I mean, M&A is something we're thinking about quite regularly, right? I mean, but I'll just remind you sort of our overall capital allocation priorities, right? I mean growth is the imperative, we're seeing tremendous organic growth and that remains the number one priority. I mean, we'll invest in CapEx and OpEx as Amol mentioned earlier about 80 basis points even in this environment to support our growth ambitions. We feel extremely good about that. Second, to support the growth, we're looking at M&A opportunities and the pipeline is very robust, not just in the adjacencies, but also in the coal. In some areas they are richer than others, of course, you can imagine I can't comment more specifically on it. And if we don't find something that is financially reasonable and sensible, will of course continue to do buybacks as we've done in the past. But growth remains the priority. As far as timing is concerned, that's always better to comment in the rearview mirror. Amol, do you want to talk about the leverage ratios? So Michael, I can give you the algorithm, and I'm going to disappoint you that I'm not going to give you very, very deep specifics on each of these. So just to review the drivers, right? First, I mean, the end markets that we serve are resilient and robust, as you know, right? So 80% as I've talked repeatedly are pretty robust and we feel good about the resiliency of these end markets. Now whatever that number is historically been X and now it's definitely X plus delta X, some of it driven by volume and some of it also driven by increased pricing, right? So take that as a starting point. Then from a Water specific standpoint, there are three different contributors. We had said at our Analyst Day about 100 basis points, you can expect probably a bit higher this particular year from our commercial initiatives, instrument replacement, CDMO, service, as well as e-commerce, all of those are contributing quite handsomely and so definitely north of 100 hundred basis points this year. What we're seeing very nicely now dovetailed into that is the second independent driver, which is innovation, right? And I took some time today and I've -- and we had a big debate internally how much we should elaborate, but I felt it was necessary given the questions that I think you guys have asked on the durability of growth. Innovation is really, really contributing already significantly, right? MaxPeak Premier fastest launch in Waters' history in terms of columns. And we've been launching columns since 1970 and some of them are still in the market and this one's done better than anything they've launched. Second, the MassSpec portfolio is totally revived and we're definitely in the early innings of extraction. PFAs testing is a significant need for water testing and we have the best instrument in class. So really feel good about that and we didn't talk much about TA today, right? But TA has also revitalized innovation with our powder rheology instrument that test powders that go into coating, anodes and cathodes for battery testing. So feel extremely good about it, I won't give you a number, I mean, likely in Q4, we can comment looking backwards on what the contribution has been from innovation, but innovation is contributing handsomely. The adjacencies now, again, a question that I think several of you've asked, how good is attraction? I took some time today to talk about BioAccord, I mean, the same thing we see with batteries. We're starting to see with LCMS, I was at the AACR, this is the American Association of Clinical Research in Chicago with the team and there's a strong demand from our spec for early disease detection in the clinical space. So again, the different adjacencies are starting to contribute. And remember, we said that they will more meaningfully contribute beyond 2024, but we're already starting to see them contribute. And that I think overall explains the beyond market performance. And I think, again, we took some time to give you the three-year stacked growth rate, because I mean short-term changes quarter-on-quarter can sort of dilute the outperformance. But if you look at it on a stack basis, on a two to three year basis, we're outperforming quite significantly the peer group. So I hope that gives you clarity and helps you think through how the demand is going to shape up for the coming years. Thank you."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another excellent quarter in Q3 with 15% constant currency growth. Waters division grew 14% and TA grew 18%. By end market, pharma grew 9%, industrial grew 22%, and academic and government grew 29%. In pharma, we saw growth in both large and small molecule with strength across segments, applications and regions. In industrial, each of our major regions grew mid-teens or above with China up almost 30%, Europe up over 20%, and U.S. growing 16%. Growth was led by LCMS instrument sales, which grew 50% with our chemical analysis, food and environmental businesses, all delivering strong growth. In academic and government, growth was also strong across all regions. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 18%, the Americas grew 11% and Europe grew 14%. In Asia, growth was led by China where sales grew 23% as we executed well across all trade classes, despite the challenges posed by new lockdowns. In the Americas, the U.S. grew 11% with growth across applications and end markets. Europe grew 14% in the quarter, led by industrial, which grew over 20% and pharma, which grew low double-digits. By products and services, instruments grew 21% with our LCMS and TA portfolios each growing double-digits. Recurring revenues grew 10% with chemistry up 10% and service up 9%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year's quarter. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis and rheology. Demand for TA products remained strong across all regions with sales in electronics, and batteries continuing to ramp. Gross margin for the quarter was 56.7%, compared to 58.9% in the third quarter of 2021. We had incredible growth in instrument sales this quarter with MassSpec growing nearly 40%. While this resulted in approximately 40 basis points of adverse mix impact for the quarter, it is expected to drive future margin accretive recurring revenue growth. The strong U.S. dollar resulted in 120 basis points of FX headwind on gross margin in the quarter. We have continued to offset the impact of inflation with pricing increases. Working with our customers, our teams delivered over 350 basis points of net pricing gains in the quarter. While inflation had no net impact on our gross profit dollars, it does affect margin calculation as the revenue base is also higher. This dynamics drove the remaining difference in the year-over-year gross margin for the quarter. But again, there was no net impact of inflation on gross profit dollars or earnings per share as the incremental inflationary costs were offset by pricing increases. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 27.8%, compared to 29.7% in the third quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds and the gross margin dynamics. Year-to-date operating margins have expanded 70 basis points before 110 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. The expansion of 70 basis points includes the investments we have been making to nurture our higher growth adjacencies and includes the impact of higher instrument mix and the inflation dynamics I just discussed. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%, average share count came in at 60.1 million shares, which is about 1.8 million less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter was $2.64 in comparison to $2.66 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 13%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.60. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $126 million after funding $32 million of capital expenditures. Since last quarter, accounts receivable have moved back in line with historical pattern relative to our sales volume. However, we continue to build inventory as a proactive measure to secure supply and build safety stock given strong instrument demand. In the third quarter, our inventory balance increased by $32 million. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought out attractive high growth adjacent markets. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 483,000 shares of our common stock for $155 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about $1.1 billion. Now as we look ahead to the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022. We have seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand, excellent commercial execution across all our geographies and new product introductions, which are driving growth. As we close the year, we expect our sales momentum to remain solid and that our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives will continue to enhance our performance. We also expect to successfully navigate supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures assuming these challenges do not worsen. In light of this continued strong performance, we are raising our full-year 2022 guidance to 11.5% to 12% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 9.5% to 10.5%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in a full-year reported sales growth guidance of 5.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full-year is expected to be nearly 58% and includes 100 basis points of FX headwinds versus prior year. Operating margin is expected to be 3.2%, which includes 120 basis points of underlying margin expansion offset by 120 basis points of FX headwind. We expect our full-year net interest expense to be approximately $38 million and full-year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.3 million. Our share repurchase program will continue as we progress through the rest of the year and we'll provide updates as appropriate. Rolling all these together and on a non-GAAP basis, full-year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.85 to $11.95, which is 6% to 7% growth versus last year, despite a negative currency impact of approximately 11 percentage points. What is the previous guide, our updated guidance includes improved underlying business performance of $0.14 offset by $0.24 of higher FX headwind. At current FX rates, we estimate the full-year FX impact on 2023 to be a year-over-year headwind of 2% to 3% on sales and 4% to 5% on adjusted EPS. FX impact is expected to be largely concentrated in the first half of 2023 at current rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 8 percentage points resulting in a fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of minus 2% to 0%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.66 to $3.76, which is flat to 3% higher than prior year's quarter, despite negative currency impact of approximately 15 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it [Technical Difficulty] summary comments. Udit? Yes. So, Vijay, look, I mean, on the gross margin line that are sort of four vectors that are playing out, right? There is FX, there is a higher instrument mix, there is new product launches, and then there is the pricing inflation dynamics that I just discussed. And each of these vectors are going to be accretive in driving gross margin expansion in the times to come. I mean, on the FX side, we really feel excited about the fact that despite this headwind, the business has rallied to find ways to offset the impact of exchange rate. And when the exchange rates normalize, you will see a much more pronounced impact on the margin, because of the resilience that has already played out in our 2022 numbers. On the instrument mix, I mean, it's a great problem to have. While this instrument growth is creating somewhat of a headwind on the margin today, it is going to drive accretive recurring gross margin growth from chemistry and service in the future. We've seen also great growth from our new products and it sort of underscores that innovation matters in this space. But as you can understand, anytime when you launch new products, they haven't gone through the typical value engineering cycle that they go at Waters like we've gone through with Alliance. And we will see that play out on the gross margin of these newer products in the coming years. And then the last piece is the pricing inflation dynamics, right? And there, the pricing gains are systemic, we've built muscle in terms of systems and processes to drive pricing gains more than what we have historically driven, which was 50 basis points to 75 basis points. And on the other hand, a lot of inflation is spot buys. And as the electronic component market, sort of, normalizes, some of this spot buy pressure will go away again providing tailwind to the gross margin. So overall, I mean, we are still on track where we say, look, I mean, we will have about 100 basis points of margin expansion in the underlying business between volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. And we will reinvest 70 basis points to 80 basis points of those gains in nurturing our higher growth adjacencies in the near-term. Yes. And then covering on the margin, right? So I think at this stage, we feel really good about where each of our initiatives are? I mean, our volume leverage is working with a strong instrument growth this year, we think that will have an accretive mix impact on the recurring revenue, bringing better gross margin profile next year. We do see, sort of, the level of spot buys slowing down and we have gained a lot of confidence and comfort in the systems and processes that we've implemented for pricing. So all of that will enable us to stay on the track that we outlined at our Investor Day, which is still roughly 100 basis points of underlying margin expansion with a 70 basis points to 80 basis points of reinvestment in higher growth adjacencies. And good to add to that, Matt, right? For Q3, China benefited with a lower baseline, because of the $12 million shipment delay last year, so that's about 10 percentage points of growth. But at the same time, they did have a headwind from some of the newer lockdowns, so one has to keep that in mind. And as Udit outlined, you know, for us, the team is executing really well and working towards a mid-teens growth profile for the year. Yes. So I mean, what we've done is we've looked at sort of our product profile and we've gone through bill of materials for pretty much every product and gone through secondary and tertiary supply chains and identified hotspots where a certain component that travels through the supply chain is sort of in shortage. And there, we've gone deep to build relationships with the primary supplier and have secured quantities that will last us for longer than usual times, right? And where possible we have built alternative supplies especially for electronic components and where possible we will also build geographical diversification. So you're sort of not stuck in a lockdown in China or in a place where you have a sole source. Now that has put some pressure on inventory, because we've sort of accumulated this inventory in preparation for the demand that we are seeing on the instrument side and in preparation for potential supply disruptions that may be caused by COVID or other sort of macroeconomic events. But at this point, we feel really good where supply chain stands, right, progressively a lot of the yellows have been resolved and things are sort of between green and yellow on most of the items. Yes. Luke, I mean, it's a great question. And the way we look at it is, let's say, when you grow instruments by 21% your installed base doesn't grow by 21%, right? Because the installed base on an average is, let's say, seven years, and so you get a 3% bump if all these instruments were new placements. But close to 70% or 80% of them are replacements. So they are sort of not adding to the installed base, the new ones are. But also on the ones that you replace, you expect higher utilization at least on chemistry. So all of these become available to what you can drive your recurring revenue on. And as we've pointed out on service, we've been very successful 200 basis points last year and this year, we said we would do 100 basis points and we already did 100 basis points in the first half of the year. And again, there one has to think not all of it is incremental revenue, because these customers are already buying spare parts from us outside of the plants. So the incremental revenue is sort of a fraction of what the attachment rate would bring. But overall, with this great instrument growth, we feel really excited how much recurring revenue we can drive both on chemistry, as well as on service in the years to come. Yes. I mean, in general, our thinking is, first of all, we want to be absolutely financially disciplined and make sure that on a risk adjusted basis any transaction creates value for our shareholders. And then in terms of financing, we want to stay investment grade as much as possible or even lower. So that the interest rates have gone up and that can create a dilutive impact on EPS accretion. But as long as we are sort of within investment grade, we should be able to thread the needle."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters Corporation second quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 02, 2022 in Part 1A under the caption Risk Factors, both of which are on file with the SEC as well as the cautionary language included in this morning's press release. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation which are available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent results, led by instrument growth of 12% with continued broad-based strength across our end markets and geographies. I would like to take a moment to, again, acknowledge the unwavering efforts of our teams who have persistently worked through the challenging environment to deliver for our customers. We saw this with our China team whose dedication and agility through the lockdowns in Shanghai drove exceptional results against this quarter, which came ahead of our expectations. But importantly, we've seen this commitment across all our teams and regions, and it truly reflects the indomitable spirit we have here at Waters. Turning now to Slide 3, we have three messages; how strong commercial momentum is driving great results in markets that remain healthy. This is reflected in the broad sustained growth we are delivering across our products, geographies and end markets. Customer demand remains robust with orders that again outpacing sales as our strong momentum continued with double-digit sales growth again in the second quarter. Innovation is contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refresh product portfolio is highly competitive and providing key benefits to our customers, which is again driving stronger option of these new products, as well as market share gains. Over time, we expect that the strong instrument placements and resulting expansion in our install base will drive growth in recurring revenue, tied to these instruments. And thirdly, we have a robust business model serving an attractive and resilient base. Waters serve end markets with sustainable growth drivers that are linked to key demographic areas, such as fill [ph] count population growth and increasing regulatory requirements around testing. With our strong business model, we have growth levers that exist throughout the market cycle, across instruments, service, chemistry and informatics. Growth in one of these areas, usually results in follow-through performance across our business model and you can see this today with our strong pull through of instrument sales into higher attachment rates, which is again driving recurring revenue growth. Now moving on to Slide 4; in the second quarter, revenue grew 5% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis with broad strength across our end markets and geographies, as well as in both instruments and recurring revenues. Orders in the quarter exceeded sales of $714 million as we continued to see very strong demand from our customers. Our Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.75 up 6% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds. The impact of FX headwind lowered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth by 11% versus the prior quarter. Amol will cover the impact of FX in more detail later in the call. Now looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First by operating segment, Waters division grew 10% while DA grew 12%. By end market, our largest market category pharma grew 10%, industrial grew 8% and academic and government grew 16%. In pharma, we saw continued broad based strength across segments, geographies and applications with growth in large molecule and small applications. Growth was led by the US, which grew mid-teens with large molecule applications growing twice the rate of small molecule applications. China, which grew in mid-teens and India, which grew 12%. In industrial, growth was driven by the US up mid-teens; Europe, up high single digits and India, which grew over 50%. Our food and environmental business is performing well business is performing well with EFAS [ph] testing also positively impacting growth. In academic and government, after seeing a slower recovery than our other end markets last year, customer spending continued to be more active during the quarter with mid-teens growth for the quarter, led by strength in China, India and the Americas. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 9%, the Americas grew 15% and Europe grew 7%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 9% despite the presence of COVID-related lockdowns for much of the quarter. Customer demand in China remained strong and we're observing great activity levels which rapidly picked up in June relative to April and May when the lockdowns were in effect. Meanwhile, sales in India grew 24%. The Americas was again our fastest-growing region, with the U.S. growing 14%, which was led by strong instrument sales, which grew 20% along with recurring revenues, which grew 11%. In Europe, the growth was led by pharma and industrial, which both grew high single digits. By products and services, instruments grew 12%, with our LC mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry, up 9%, and service, up 8%. New products again contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter with unit sales of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier more than doubling versus the second quarter of last year. Unit sales of MaxPeak Premier columns also more than doubled and have continued to add strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, driven by large molecule applications. In mass spec, we saw strength across our portfolio, including for our Xevo TQ-XS and cyclic IMS instruments as well as strong traction for our newly launched Xevo TQ Absolute, which sold out at launch and has already developed a backlog. Customers are seeing the value that TQ Absolute provides in application areas such as food safety and pharma development in small and large molecules -- small molecule applications given its dramatic leap in performance and efficiency compared with other instruments in its class. Here in New England, one state public health laboratory was the first to purchase and installed TQ Absolute for the express purpose of PFAS testing in water and environmental samples. That customer told us that TQ Absolute is giving them a 100 to 400-fold increase in sensitivity versus their prior instrument while being far easier to use in terms of sample prep and in quickly giving them highly accurate results. Meanwhile, at the high end, we're seeing good demand for our cyclic IM mobility technology. One example is researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas who are using it for precision molecular profiling within OMEX research. We're getting feedback that it is enabling significant progress in discovering and validating novel blood and plasma biomarkers for early disease detection in oncology. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 12%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong across all regions, led by electronics and batteries. Now moving to Slide 6. I would like to reflect on the excellent strength and momentum we have sustained in the first half of the year driven by our commercial execution, product innovation and pricing offsetting inflation, leading to these great results. So far this year, instruments have grown almost 20%, with recurring revenue up just under 10% against strong stacked comps last year. In the U.S., instruments have grown over 35% year-to-date. All our regions have seen growth, led by Americas, which has grown 20 years -- 20% year-to-date. Meanwhile, China has grown low teens despite the COVID-related lockdowns, which we were able to successfully navigate through in both the first and second quarters of 2022. Each of our end markets have seen double-digit growth, which speaks to our broad execution across regions and segments. Meanwhile, we continue to observe strong demand from our customers and are seeing ongoing positive impacts from our market plus growth initiatives. Now turning to Slide 7; like each of these initiatives continue to progress, the 3 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are service attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch excellence. First, with service attachment, we're seeing strong pull-through of our instrument sales into service plan coverage which has driven our attachment rates over 100 basis points higher so far this year which is ahead of our expectations and builds on excellent results last year. The progress we're making with service underscores the opportunity ahead to grow our recurring revenues which layers on top of our instrument growth. Second, also part of our recurring revenues, e-commerce adoption of chemistry has continued to move higher which is having a positive effect on sales by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and driving incremental growth opportunities. 31% of our chemistry is now sold through digital channels, which is a 10-point increase compared to 2019 when the initiative began, and we see further runway to over 50% in the long term. Since we started the initiative in 2019, revenue from digital sales has more than doubled. And in the first half of this year, it grew over 30% versus the first half of 2021. Third, our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth as demand has scaled up for Arc HPLC, for ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier columns. Our product vitality index has grown 300 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 15% as sales of these products have quickly ramped, with launch excellence and the impact of innovation driving strong market uptake. As I've shared before, ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large molecules. This technology is capturing growth opportunities as pharma customers seek to expand their capacity and build capabilities for biologics and novel modalities, such as oligonucleotides, mRNA and peptides. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to refresh and expand their capital equipment with Arc HPLC. Now on Slide 8. In June, at ASMS, we announced our new Xevo G3 high-resolution mass spec. The G3 is our latest generation benchtop Q-top [ph] and it provides increased sensitivity and range for large molecule analysis over its predecessor, the G2, which is one of our best-selling high-res mass spec products. This instrument is described by our customers as an analytical workhorse given that it offers the power and range needed to characterize complex biotherapeutics while also providing the reliability, robustness and reproducibility needed in late-stage development. As biologics and novel modalities increasingly move into later stages, this instrument supports the associated workflows by allowing more detailed characterization of these molecules in product and process development. This occurs before they move downstream into higher volume manufacturing QA/QC where routine analysis will then be performed on instruments such as BioAccord. A further key piece of innovation is the software we've developed on waters_connect which allows the compliant workflows developed on the G3 to seamlessly transition to BioAccord with just a few mouse clicks. This ease of transfer had been unheard of before now and it allows our customers to transfer data between instruments and global locations within their enterprise network, all while remaining in an industry compliance setting. On waters_connect, our latest apps are enabling exciting new analytical areas for the G3 and BioAccord, including cell culture media analysis and peptide analysis with in-depth protein and glycan profiling. Most recently, we've added the ability to characterize oligonucleotides and conduct impurity analysis as well as perform lipid nanoparticle compositional analysis and stability testing which is highly relevant for mRNA molecules. These are all new analytical areas in large molecule characterization where there is a lot of long-term potential as the market looks for more advanced characterization capabilities for biologics and novel modalities. As we continue to innovate and expand our offering, we are increasingly well positioned to support biologics and novel modalities as they move downstream into routine analysis. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. Udit already covered the breakdown of our sales growth for the quarter, so I will now cover the remaining elements of our non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 57% and compared to 58.9% in the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar as well as higher instrument mix. Pricing for the quarter was over 300 basis points, successfully offsetting the impact of material and freight inflation. Operating margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.2% in the second quarter of 2021. This represents 70 basis points of margin expansion in constant currency before 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. For the first half of the year, operating margins have expanded 120 basis points before 80 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. Average share count came in at 60.5 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the second quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 6% to $2.75 in comparison to $2.60 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our EPS growth by 11%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.72 compared to $2.69 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $67 million after funding $39 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $11 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment. Our free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our proactive measures to secure supply and rebuild safety stock, resulting in a $40 million increase in inventory before exchange rates. Additionally, timing of shipments and installations, particularly in China, resulted in an 8-day increase of DSO to 81 days and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $60 million before FX. We expect these dynamics to correct in the second half of the year as we have already observed an increase in collections in July. For the full year, we anticipate being close to our historical free cash flow conversion levels. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out, attractive, high-growth, adjacent markets. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 479,000 shares of our common stock for $152 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1. Now as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across all our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect our solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives and innovation will provide a lasting contribution to our performance. We also expect to continue to successfully address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, assuming these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 9.5% to 10.5% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 7.5% to 9%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 5 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be about 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5% as our resilient business momentum is able to mitigate the impact from exchange rates. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.4 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into the year and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Now rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.95 to $12.05, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 9 percentage points. Currency impact is $0.56 incrementally more worse than our previous guide. However, our stronger-than-expected results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the currency headwind. Looking to the third quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 8% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 10 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. So in summary, we are pleased with our sustained broad strength for the quarter which was driven by our strong commercial execution and the impact of innovation in our highly competitive refreshed product portfolio. Demand has remained strong across our end markets as we've continued to capture growth opportunities in both large and small molecule applications, food and environmental testing and battery material analysis, which each have long-term durable growth opportunities that we're well positioned for. To reflect our strength, we're raising our full year constant currency sales growth from -- sales growth guidance from 7.5% to 9% to 9.5% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, we have delivered great operating results despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. And for EPS, our strong results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the quarter. Udit, maybe my first one for you. You did mention orders were about of revenues in the quarter. Can you give a little bit color on where the order strength is coming from? Which customer segment, which product class? And any comment on order growth rates, if you will. I think in the past call, there's been some debate on instrument pull forward, so color on orders would be helpful.\nUdit Batra: Sure. So firstly, thank you, Vijay. Really, it's been another fantastic, fantastic quarter. And the growth has again been driven by instruments really leading the charge. Orders came in ahead of sales again, which increases our backlog. From a demand perspective, it's really very much broad-based. I mean, pharma grew 10%, industrial 8% and you also saw academia grow 16%. And for the first half of the year, all three of our end market segments are now in the double-digit range, right? So pharma is 14%, industrial and applied is at 12% and academic and government at 10%. So we see really broad-based demand across our end markets. And from a geographic perspective, again, nice momentum across the board. The U.S. and India sort of leading the chart. The U.S. at 14%, India at 24%. And very nice to see China really in the high single digits at 9%. And again, first half of the year, Americas at plus 20%; China, mid-teens; India, again, in the 20s. So really broad-based strength across customers and geography. And we see really no sign of any sort of slowdown.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Udit. And maybe one for Amol. I think FX, Amol, you said incremental $0.50 plus. So what is the total impact now? I think it's close to $1. And I think your guide implies back half gross margin step-up. Why would gross margin step up if you have this FX dynamic? And I think you're also assuming tax rate steps up in the back half. First half has been sub-15%. So any color will be helpful.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So let me take those 3 one by one. So on exchange rate, the full year guidance last time was about $0.45. Now it's 9% adverse, so $1.01. So incrementally $0.56 worse. And that plays out across our Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so if you see, we are covering that $0.55 with a better business performance. $0.33 -- $0.31 of that already came in Q2, because Q2 versus our previous guide, the exchange rates were worse off roughly by $0.18 and we delivered $0.15 higher than our guidance midpoint; so a total of $0.31. And then in Q3, when we guided last time, there was embedded assumption of $0.08 FX and now it's $0.26. So that sort of creates a $0.18 headwind on Q3 which is reflected in our guide for Q3. So that's the story on FX. Coming to gross margin, so look, I mean, typically, in the second half of the year, we have more sales and that reduces volume leverage, both in terms of our operations and absorption. And also in the first half of the year, 2 things happened, right? One, there was more activity around spot buys and that flowed through the P&L. We expect that activity to somewhat slow down. I mean the whole supply chain situation is improving but improving in baby steps. We are clearly not out of the woods, but it feels a little better than before. And the second piece is the exchange rates moved so quickly that you have transaction and translation gains and losses that also flowed through our cost of goods which is reflected in the gross margin. So net of those things, we think in the second half you will see a better impact on the gross margin side. And then the third question on the tax, yes, the tax rate for the first half of the year is lower than 15.5%, but that's driven by one-off discrete items which we don't think will repeat in the second half. And there will be some catch-up Q1 sort of how our phasing of the profit is across the year. So at this point, 15.5% is a prudent guidance for tax rate.\nUdit Batra: So maybe just one sort of summary comment on really the very precise and nice description that Amol has given. I mean our top line continues to do extremely well, right? And we've just guided to a double-digit growth for the full year after printing a 6% -- 16% growth for last year and then 16% in Q1, first half of the year in the teens. So top line momentum continues. This flows very nicely through the P&L. And the EPS on an organic basis is in the high teens, right, even for the full year in the guide, right? On an organic basis, it's in the high teens, which basically sets us up really well as we go into next year, right? And in our trends, in our sort of results, there is no benefit of COVID or M&A embedded, right? So it's a very clean number that you can build off for the next year and shows the strength of our business provided we continue to deliver on the top line. And with resilient end markets with great innovation and such a good team executing, we feel very good about where we stand.\nAmol Chaubal: Exactly. And just to build on that. The $0.55 sticks with us in the baseline and the $0.55 adverse effects, once the currencies recorrect, it will come back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Luke Sergott with Barclays. Your line is open.\nLuke Sergott: So I want to follow up, Udit, what you were just talking about, with the kind of the jump-off point you guys are doing like high teens right now from an instrument perspective. And then how should we think about that being able to continue to run here? You gave some backlog commentary. You're starting to build on the high-end mass spec and on from a new upgrade cycle. So just give us how -- give us a sense of how you guys think that, that continues to progress throughout the rest of the year and even early into '23 in a potential recessionary environment.\nUdit Batra: Luke, firstly, thank you for the question. I mean, we're very pleased with our performance. I'll start with the back end of your question and answer your instrument question as I go through the answer. Relatively speaking, when we look at our competitive environment, I mean, we're performing extremely well, right? And instrument has been a big -- instruments have been a big part of -- a big part of the story, where in the first half, as you mentioned, instruments are growing close to 20% and overall 13% or so growth and orders again being higher than sales. So yes, we read a lot about the macro challenges. But if you look at what we've been through from an execution perspective and now less than 2 years -- I joined slightly less than 2 years ago, we've gained our leading position, that, too, during a pandemic. Innovation is starting to contribute meaningfully to growth. So I have a lot of faith in the team that has been able to pull this off. So if at all there is a downturn, which we don't see from what we have as visibility to our end markets. And across our end markets, we are extremely well positioned. Even back in 2009, Waters was one of the few companies that showed a positive EPS growth. And today, we are even better positioned, right? So if you just look at our portfolio, at that point we had 40% recurring revenues, today, it's over 55%. Our end markets where we're seeing incredible strength, especially with large molecules in pharma, our end markets, we're over 60% levered towards pharma, and that, too, in late stages of pharma which is super resilient. In applied industrial and applied, over 50% is in food and environmental. And in the TA segment, more and more levered towards higher growth segments like batteries. So I feel extremely good about how we're positioned towards the -- in the end markets as well. And with such traction, even with such heavy headwinds from FX, we're able to deliver and commit to the EPS that we signed up for before. So feel extremely good about where we are. Now to your instrument question, look, historically, instruments, if you just look at Waters' history over the last 15 years, are 3% to 4% growers. We're clocking 19%. So it's naive to think that we will continue to be at 19% or so in instrument growth. So I'm sure it will slow down. But we have a lot left in the -- from the initiatives that we started with earlier in the year. The replacement cycle is still ongoing, we expect this to continue to go for the next 2 to 3 years. We see better and better attachment rates as a consequence. We've expanded into new segments with CDMOs and CXOs. So feel very good about where we are in the implementation of our initiatives and that continues to benefit the instrument growth rate. So in summary, to your instrument question, no, don't expect 19% growth forever, but do expect our initiatives to help us continue to drive higher than the 3% to 4% that we've seen historically. I hope that gives you more color.\nLuke Sergott: It does. It does. And then on China, can you talk about -- I mean, you guys are guiding to 200 to 300 basis points in the quarter, it came in at 9%. So talk about how that kind of paced out versus your expectations. And then the low to mid-teens guide is essentially there already with the first half performance, so how should we think about China in the back half?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Firstly, incredibly proud of the team. I mean, if you'd asked me in April and May where we were going to land, I mean it was -- it was the headwinds that we talked about. In June, incredible, incredible performance from the teams to be able to ship the products that we did and get them to our customers. So I feel very good about what we achieved. And for the back half of the year, I mean, the full year, we think will be in the mid-teens for China. So no real slowdown. Again, strength across all end markets. And also in the TA business, right? So strength across, especially where we see our instrument replacement cycle doing very well, Arc HPLC doing very well. Increasingly the biopharmaceutical applications for our premier technology, ACQUITY Premier, doing very well. So across the board, China feels extremely good from a demand perspective. So mid-teens for the full year, barring any significant shutdowns in that geography.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Just one thing to add. Last year, we had shipment issue in Q3. And so close to $12 million of sales moved from Q3 to Q4. So the baseline for Q3 is somewhat lower. And so you will see a more pronounced growth in China in Q3 with a more subdued growth in Q4 because of last year's shipment dynamics.\nUdit Batra: I mean it's a lumpy sort of environment, as you can see, quarter-to-quarter. But I mean, overall, look, 16% growth last year, mid-teens already at the middle point of this year, and we feel very good where we sit today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Brenna with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDaniel Brenna: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe -- just first question, just kind of back to the answer that you just provided in terms of the macro. You guys sound very confident which is great. Just the perspective that we have is like, I guess, in '08, you guys were up 4.5%. In '09, you contracted around the same amount, so a 9-point swing. And as you mentioned, business is dramatically different plus all the commercial initiatives that you guys are executing on, so -- as well. I don't think -- hopefully, most of us don't expect another recession like we had back then. But net-net, to the extent that the economy does continue this level, presumably borders won't be immune from that, so could you just give a little more color about like the sensitivity or lack thereof across your different businesses? what might be a decent starting point to think about if in fact the economy does worsen how you would react in that in '23?\nUdit Batra: I mean, firstly, Dan, thank you for the question. Look, it's similar to what I just mentioned. I mean, let's just take each of the end markets in turn and the composition in each of the end markets, right? So in pharma in particular, amongst our peer group, we probably have the highest exposure to late-stage 1pharma QA/QC, which is -- which is more proportional to pill count. And recession or no recession, people don't stop taking medicines and they don't stop -- they don't want -- the pharma companies don't stop manufacturing their medicines. If anything, the R&D funding starts to slow down, right? So being levered more to QA/QC in pharma is very helpful, both in small and in large molecules. Second, if you look at our industrial and applied segment, over half of it is now food and environmental. Again, food safety, especially in our food PFAS testing with our renewed portfolio, is a strong, strong growth driver, both in food and environmental testing. And then in the TA business, that, too, starts to look quite different, right, with the batteries testing segment becoming larger and larger. So we're looking at more secular drivers across the end markets. And the growth is broad-based. The business is geographically quite disparate, right? So we have significant presence ex U.S., I mean, which, of course, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, we have to offset quite a significant FX impact. But it's much more diversified and it's much more helpful than when you see changes across different geographies happening at different pace. So feel really good about where we stand in terms of our end market exposure. Second, this market responds to innovation. And you've seen that already, right? So back when I joined less than two years ago, people were telling me, \"Hey, Waters is levered towards the small molecule QA/QC segment and this is commoditized.\" Well, we've just shown quite the opposite with Arc HPLC coming in, with better performance, without having our customers refile their processes and revalidate their testing and we've shown that segment grow. So this market responds to innovation, and we are in a very, very good place from an innovation standpoint. And finally and most importantly, we have a team here with us that has navigated through the pandemic, through macroeconomic challenges, while eight out of nine of us are now new in our seats, right? So I'm very, very confident that whatever the economy throws at us, we'll be able to deal with it. And we are in a very good position versus what you saw back in 2008 and 2009, even then Waters was able to navigate pretty, pretty effectively. I hope that gives you more color.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatthew Sykes: Congrats on the quarter. Maybe the first question, Udit, I know you've talked in the past about the academic government market and that was an area of focus for you going forward. Clearly, some of the initiatives that you did there have paid off with the growth that you saw this quarter. Can you just maybe talk about what was the inflection for that end market this quarter? Was it Waters-specific initiatives? Or is there something going on in that particular end market that results in that growth? And how sustainable is that in your mind?\nUdit Batra: Matt, thank you for the question. We're very happy with where we are with academic and government. I mean, first half of the year, double-digit growth. This quarter, 16% or so growth. But I'll remind you that this is a lumpy market and we have a low base from last year, right? So if you look at a three-year stack growth rate, we're roughly 40-ish percent inorganic growth rate in that segment. It's very heavily levered towards instruments and instruments did extremely well this quarter and the last quarter. So still rather volatile segment because -- or lumpy segment because of the heavy instrument portfolio that we have in that segment. That said, we are -- we have initiated our focus and our turnaround in that segment but we are far from done, right? So we still have work to do on increasing our e-commerce presence and e-procurement presence. I mean, that's going well but not yet done. From a commercial standpoint, we are reinitiating and -- reinitiating our KOL contracts which help with our high-resolution mass spec portfolio. Even though the portfolio is renewed, from a commercial standpoint, we still feel we have work to do. So while we are happy with the results, I would not declare victory yet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nJosh Waldman: Just one for Udit and one for Amol. Udit, orders again outpaced sales. Can you provide more context on the backlog at this point? I guess the magnitude of the backlog and the level of visibility you think that provides into the second half and maybe even into '23. You had previously commented you didn't think orders are benefiting from pull forward. Is that still your sense?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Josh, thanks for the question. No pull forward, orders are still higher than sales. All end markets, as I said before, are doing -- doing well. So we feel good about where we stand from a demand perspective. And it's too early to talk about 2023, right? So there's a balance of the year to navigate in a turbulent environment. That said, the demand drivers are still there. Innovation is doing very well. And we feel that where -- our commercial presence is -- and our commercial execution is helping us grab opportunities and differentially so versus our competition. So thank you for the question, but no pull forward, feel very good about where we stand from a demand perspective.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. And Amol, I guess, in light of that and in light of kind of the stronger-than-guided Q2, the backlog build, the second half guide, organic guide, seems a bit conservative. I guess can you comment on the considerations that went into the updated organic growth guide? Maybe where there might be opportunities for upside, maybe risk to the downside. And then the guide seems to assume a lighter Q4 is -- I mean is there a concern around budget flushing or anything like that, that's being reflected in the guide?\nAmol Chaubal: Look, our Q3 guide is 8% to 10%. Adjusted for the shipment issue is like 6% to 8%. The implied Q4 guide is sort of 5% to 7%. Adjusted for the shipment is 6% to 8%. So again, I mean, at this stage, we have visibility in our pipeline for Q3, Q4. We feel good about it. But at this stage, it's good to be prudent, especially for Q4. So we feel good about where the guide is at this stage. And our teams continue to execute flawlessly and continue to beat our expectations.\nUdit Batra: And then I think I didn't address your backlog question. I mean the backlog is at healthy levels, right? Waters did not have for a while, I would say, a healthy backlog. We feel more than feel at least a bit better that we have a reasonable backlog. It's not -- it's reasonable, but it's not super, super substantial, right? It's reasonable it allows us to navigate through any sort of turbulence. A lot of visibility into Q3, and we feel good again about how we will end the year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So first up on pharma, drug pricing reform continues to be a headline topic. So can you just walk us through how you see that impacting Waters' portfolio especially given your unique exposure in small versus large molecule in QA/QC. And then have you started to have any conversations with your pharma customers regarding that drug pricing reform and do you expect that it could have any impact on your pricing power?\nUdit Batra: Rachel, thank you for the question. Really no impact that we have seen. No discussions from a customer perspective on what they're expecting. I'll remind you, we are, again, focused more on the late-stage part of -- late-stage part of the pharma value chain, right, QA/QC. And our costs are such a small portion of pharma, it usually does not impact us, right? So we don't expect that to be a discussion. COGS is such a small portion of most pharma companies sales that it's not a place where they look for costs. So we have not seen that in the past when pricing discussions have come up. And we don't expect it -- and we don't see any signals right now and we don't expect it to be in the future given that we're in the QA/QC domain in COGS is such a small portion of their cost base. Now in the early stages of research, perhaps there could be an impact, but we -- as I said, we're very levered towards QA/QC.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik De Bruin: So I'm just curious, really good growth in India, 24%. But I do recall that a few years ago when the dollar appreciated strongly against the rupee that some of your customers in India didn't have enough money budgeted, so they didn't have the purchasing power as for go out and do it and it sort of delayed orders. The combination of FX and price increases, are you worried at all about some emerging economies, particularly India, to be slowing in demand because a bit on the budgets?\nUdit Batra: I'll start off, Derik, and I'll let Amol comment a little bit on the FX piece as well. Really, India has been doing extremely well given the demand for small molecule production, again reviving, and some of this has to do with the government initiatives in India that were initiated last year and us being so heavily focused on that part of pharma, QA/QC for genetics, QA/QC for small molecules, in India, we've seen an outsized benefit and that's continued well into this year. So it's a fundamental demand driver that we can explain based on government policy and again driven heavily by instrument growth. Consumable is doing well but driven heavily by instrument growth. Amol, do you want to comment on the FX piece?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. No. And just to build on what Udit said, right? I mean we have a fantastic team in India. And if you go back to the second quarter of last year when India was going through a very tough COVID environment, the team executed flawlessly and had a great growth in second quarter of last year. So the baseline was already high. And then again, this year, you see 24% growth in the second quarter. So a lot of confidence in that team. And then when you couple that with how we've sort of handled pricing through inflation, we've provided excruciating detailed transparency to our customers on what's happening on the semiconductor side, on the freight side. And that's allowed us to have the customers share the burden of pricing. And I think the same processes that we build, the same systems that we build are going to start playing a role in explaining the impact of exchange rate and U.S. dollar and where our cost base lies. And I think not just India, but there are other markets that are impacted by this and our commercial teams are doing a great job of providing this transparency to the customer so that we can work this through hand in hand.\nOperator: The next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: So first one for Udit, just wondering if there are any changes in the M&A approach that you talked about at the Investor Day, Udit. Just wanted to get any updated thoughts given the valuations you're seeing in the market here.\nUdit Batra: Puneet, thanks for the question. Look, I mean, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Growth is still where we are focused, right? And it starts with organic growth, right? So that's where we allocate capital first. And that is going extremely well. And we're funding internal innovation, we're funding our high-growth adjacencies, seeing really nice results. I was at AACC last week with the team on LC, MS for diagnostics, and there is a clear value proposition where as customers discover new biomarkers, mass spec has a meaningful role to play. And that reaffirmed -- we took our R&D team, we took our commercial team and we had many different workshops there with different customers. And so really feel good about what we're doing from an organic perspective and want to fund that set of adjacencies, bioseparations, analytical bioprocessing as well as batteries and LC, MS and diagnostics, so we want to fund that first. Second, from an M&A perspective, really what you should take away is, I mean, we are, of course, on the lookout for things that fit into our strategic priorities. But there's really no rush, right? I mean we've announced a few collaborations. They're going extremely well, especially the one with Sartorius on the bioanalytical characterization space, especially upstream. But really no rush. And from an M&A environment perspective, lots of discussions ongoing. We are, of course, on the lookout. But again, super financially disciplined, right? So really nothing has changed from the time we spoke. And as we have conversations, I mean, of course, people still have memories of their 52-week highs in certain areas, but look, our organic business is performing very well and the focus remains on that, on partnerships and we have a list of -- and a nice pipeline of M&A targets that we're looking at now constantly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Udit, you launched the new QTof at ASMS. It's been a long time since you refreshed that product line. Could you just talk about the importance of that introduction, whether you think it's a needle mover for the mass spec franchise overall relatively near term?\nUdit Batra: No, absolutely, Brandon, thanks for following up on that. Look, it's a workhorse instrument in that segment. And now along with the instrument being upgraded, you also have the waters_connect software, which is a compliance software, that allows not only for us to introduce new applications, but allows us to transition methods from upstream more powerful tops [ph] to BioAccord directly downstream, right? So that's a significant benefit. And that product has done very well, right? It's already doing extremely well with our customers. I mean the orders are again outpacing the sales. I mean, within the first few days, significant backlog developed, right? So we feel very good about what we've done there. And as I said, it's not just the instrument being more powerful in those segments, but it's also the launch of the waters_connect software, the informatic software that allows for an easier transition into the BioAccord in late stages. So again, really consistent with our long-term strategy of doing analysis upstream and making it seamless for the customers to transfer that analytical method downstream, especially as you look at larger and larger molecules.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe just a follow-up on kind of the M&A one earlier, a different angle. Udit, you talked about the large molecule growth kind of outpacing small molecule, even double the rate. Can you just talk about, I guess, balancing inorganic versus organic investments in that piece? Again, obviously, a big growth area you guys are kind of pouring into. So can you talk about, again, the internal strategy and then also kind of the inorganic opportunities on that front.\nUdit Batra: Thanks for the question, Patrick. Look, I mean, again, it starts with the organic piece, right? So let's just take the bioseparations and the bioanalytical characterization, high-growth adjacencies, right? On the bioanalytical characterization adjacency, we started with our collaboration with Sartorius, with our work with the University of Delaware, developed a deep understanding of upstream bioprocessing, downstream bioprocessing. The team has taken and learned that area really well. And I insist, I mean, before we make any meaningful moves in that area, we must organically develop that business well. And I feel very good on what we've been able to do in the last year. Again, learning a lot from what Sartorius does, learning a lot from what's happening at University of Delaware. So significant resource allocation there. We're not -- we're not sparing any expense as that business grows. We've already developed 4 workflows for the BioAccord for upstream characterization and 1 that is doing extremely well is cell culture media analysis upstream for bioreactors. I mean, there are 3 or 4 other workflows that have also been implemented that have been received very well. So the organic part of the business is doing very well. Now if you look at the M&A aspects of it, that opens up a whole bunch of M&A ideas, right? I mean for sampling, for data analytics, for other analytical characterization methods in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. And you'll hear more about that as we go along. And now double-clicking on bioseparations. There, we have world-leading capabilities in separating small molecules. We've already developed some nice applications with the MaxPeak Premier technology with our columns, right? So to separate oligonucleotides, to separate larger molecules better. We think there's a long runway here organically. The team is being built up quite substantially on that front. But it also opens up avenues inorganically as we learn more about that segment. So it would be nice to be able to work with somebody who has deep capabilities in reagents that are larger molecules, right? And I think that's the sort of thing we're looking at really carefully. So the organic piece is first, it opens up, it educates us on what is possible. It opens up many possibilities and that's the sequence of events. And we are, as I mentioned earlier, quite active in that area. We have quite a few ideas. And they're in different stages of pursuit at this stage.\nOperator: Thank you. And now back to you, Caspar.\nUdit Batra: Thank you very much, and thank you for all your questions. You'll agree with me that we've again had a tremendous quarter. The team continues to execute in a turbulent environment. And thank you for your participation. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver excellent results, led by instrument growth of 12% with continued broad-based strength across our end markets and geographies. I would like to take a moment to, again, acknowledge the unwavering efforts of our teams who have persistently worked through the challenging environment to deliver for our customers. We saw this with our China team whose dedication and agility through the lockdowns in Shanghai drove exceptional results against this quarter, which came ahead of our expectations. But importantly, we've seen this commitment across all our teams and regions, and it truly reflects the indomitable spirit we have here at Waters. Turning now to Slide 3, we have three messages; how strong commercial momentum is driving great results in markets that remain healthy. This is reflected in the broad sustained growth we are delivering across our products, geographies and end markets. Customer demand remains robust with orders that again outpacing sales as our strong momentum continued with double-digit sales growth again in the second quarter. Innovation is contributing meaningfully to our growth. Our refresh product portfolio is highly competitive and providing key benefits to our customers, which is again driving stronger option of these new products, as well as market share gains. Over time, we expect that the strong instrument placements and resulting expansion in our install base will drive growth in recurring revenue, tied to these instruments. And thirdly, we have a robust business model serving an attractive and resilient base. Waters serve end markets with sustainable growth drivers that are linked to key demographic areas, such as fill [ph] count population growth and increasing regulatory requirements around testing. With our strong business model, we have growth levers that exist throughout the market cycle, across instruments, service, chemistry and informatics. Growth in one of these areas, usually results in follow-through performance across our business model and you can see this today with our strong pull through of instrument sales into higher attachment rates, which is again driving recurring revenue growth. Now moving on to Slide 4; in the second quarter, revenue grew 5% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis with broad strength across our end markets and geographies, as well as in both instruments and recurring revenues. Orders in the quarter exceeded sales of $714 million as we continued to see very strong demand from our customers. Our Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.75 up 6% year-over-year, despite FX headwinds. The impact of FX headwind lowered our non-GAAP earnings per share growth by 11% versus the prior quarter. Amol will cover the impact of FX in more detail later in the call. Now looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 5 in constant currency. First by operating segment, Waters division grew 10% while DA grew 12%. By end market, our largest market category pharma grew 10%, industrial grew 8% and academic and government grew 16%. In pharma, we saw continued broad based strength across segments, geographies and applications with growth in large molecule and small applications. Growth was led by the US, which grew mid-teens with large molecule applications growing twice the rate of small molecule applications. China, which grew in mid-teens and India, which grew 12%. In industrial, growth was driven by the US up mid-teens; Europe, up high single digits and India, which grew over 50%. Our food and environmental business is performing well business is performing well with EFAS [ph] testing also positively impacting growth. In academic and government, after seeing a slower recovery than our other end markets last year, customer spending continued to be more active during the quarter with mid-teens growth for the quarter, led by strength in China, India and the Americas. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 9%, the Americas grew 15% and Europe grew 7%. In Asia, growth was led by China, where sales grew 9% despite the presence of COVID-related lockdowns for much of the quarter. Customer demand in China remained strong and we're observing great activity levels which rapidly picked up in June relative to April and May when the lockdowns were in effect. Meanwhile, sales in India grew 24%. The Americas was again our fastest-growing region, with the U.S. growing 14%, which was led by strong instrument sales, which grew 20% along with recurring revenues, which grew 11%. In Europe, the growth was led by pharma and industrial, which both grew high single digits. By products and services, instruments grew 12%, with our LC mass spec and TA portfolios each growing double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry, up 9%, and service, up 8%. New products again contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter with unit sales of Arc HPLC and ACQUITY Premier more than doubling versus the second quarter of last year. Unit sales of MaxPeak Premier columns also more than doubled and have continued to add strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, driven by large molecule applications. In mass spec, we saw strength across our portfolio, including for our Xevo TQ-XS and cyclic IMS instruments as well as strong traction for our newly launched Xevo TQ Absolute, which sold out at launch and has already developed a backlog. Customers are seeing the value that TQ Absolute provides in application areas such as food safety and pharma development in small and large molecules -- small molecule applications given its dramatic leap in performance and efficiency compared with other instruments in its class. Here in New England, one state public health laboratory was the first to purchase and installed TQ Absolute for the express purpose of PFAS testing in water and environmental samples. That customer told us that TQ Absolute is giving them a 100 to 400-fold increase in sensitivity versus their prior instrument while being far easier to use in terms of sample prep and in quickly giving them highly accurate results. Meanwhile, at the high end, we're seeing good demand for our cyclic IM mobility technology. One example is researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas who are using it for precision molecular profiling within OMEX research. We're getting feedback that it is enabling significant progress in discovering and validating novel blood and plasma biomarkers for early disease detection in oncology. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 12%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for TA products continues to be strong across all regions, led by electronics and batteries. Now moving to Slide 6. I would like to reflect on the excellent strength and momentum we have sustained in the first half of the year driven by our commercial execution, product innovation and pricing offsetting inflation, leading to these great results. So far this year, instruments have grown almost 20%, with recurring revenue up just under 10% against strong stacked comps last year. In the U.S., instruments have grown over 35% year-to-date. All our regions have seen growth, led by Americas, which has grown 20 years -- 20% year-to-date. Meanwhile, China has grown low teens despite the COVID-related lockdowns, which we were able to successfully navigate through in both the first and second quarters of 2022. Each of our end markets have seen double-digit growth, which speaks to our broad execution across regions and segments. Meanwhile, we continue to observe strong demand from our customers and are seeing ongoing positive impacts from our market plus growth initiatives. Now turning to Slide 7; like each of these initiatives continue to progress, the 3 areas I would like to highlight this quarter are service attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch excellence. First, with service attachment, we're seeing strong pull-through of our instrument sales into service plan coverage which has driven our attachment rates over 100 basis points higher so far this year which is ahead of our expectations and builds on excellent results last year. The progress we're making with service underscores the opportunity ahead to grow our recurring revenues which layers on top of our instrument growth. Second, also part of our recurring revenues, e-commerce adoption of chemistry has continued to move higher which is having a positive effect on sales by making it easier for our customers to do business with us and driving incremental growth opportunities. 31% of our chemistry is now sold through digital channels, which is a 10-point increase compared to 2019 when the initiative began, and we see further runway to over 50% in the long term. Since we started the initiative in 2019, revenue from digital sales has more than doubled. And in the first half of this year, it grew over 30% versus the first half of 2021. Third, our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth as demand has scaled up for Arc HPLC, for ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier columns. Our product vitality index has grown 300 basis points versus the second quarter of last year to 15% as sales of these products have quickly ramped, with launch excellence and the impact of innovation driving strong market uptake. As I've shared before, ACQUITY Premier and MaxPeak Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large molecules. This technology is capturing growth opportunities as pharma customers seek to expand their capacity and build capabilities for biologics and novel modalities, such as oligonucleotides, mRNA and peptides. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to refresh and expand their capital equipment with Arc HPLC. Now on Slide 8. In June, at ASMS, we announced our new Xevo G3 high-resolution mass spec. The G3 is our latest generation benchtop Q-top [ph] and it provides increased sensitivity and range for large molecule analysis over its predecessor, the G2, which is one of our best-selling high-res mass spec products. This instrument is described by our customers as an analytical workhorse given that it offers the power and range needed to characterize complex biotherapeutics while also providing the reliability, robustness and reproducibility needed in late-stage development. As biologics and novel modalities increasingly move into later stages, this instrument supports the associated workflows by allowing more detailed characterization of these molecules in product and process development. This occurs before they move downstream into higher volume manufacturing QA/QC where routine analysis will then be performed on instruments such as BioAccord. A further key piece of innovation is the software we've developed on waters_connect which allows the compliant workflows developed on the G3 to seamlessly transition to BioAccord with just a few mouse clicks. This ease of transfer had been unheard of before now and it allows our customers to transfer data between instruments and global locations within their enterprise network, all while remaining in an industry compliance setting. On waters_connect, our latest apps are enabling exciting new analytical areas for the G3 and BioAccord, including cell culture media analysis and peptide analysis with in-depth protein and glycan profiling. Most recently, we've added the ability to characterize oligonucleotides and conduct impurity analysis as well as perform lipid nanoparticle compositional analysis and stability testing which is highly relevant for mRNA molecules. These are all new analytical areas in large molecule characterization where there is a lot of long-term potential as the market looks for more advanced characterization capabilities for biologics and novel modalities. As we continue to innovate and expand our offering, we are increasingly well positioned to support biologics and novel modalities as they move downstream into routine analysis. Now I'd like to pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial performance and provide our guidance for the remainder of 2022. Amol? Thank you, Amol. So in summary, we are pleased with our sustained broad strength for the quarter which was driven by our strong commercial execution and the impact of innovation in our highly competitive refreshed product portfolio. Demand has remained strong across our end markets as we've continued to capture growth opportunities in both large and small molecule applications, food and environmental testing and battery material analysis, which each have long-term durable growth opportunities that we're well positioned for. To reflect our strength, we're raising our full year constant currency sales growth from -- sales growth guidance from 7.5% to 9% to 9.5% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, we have delivered great operating results despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. And for EPS, our strong results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the impact of foreign exchange headwinds. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? Sure. So firstly, thank you, Vijay. Really, it's been another fantastic, fantastic quarter. And the growth has again been driven by instruments really leading the charge. Orders came in ahead of sales again, which increases our backlog. From a demand perspective, it's really very much broad-based. I mean, pharma grew 10%, industrial 8% and you also saw academia grow 16%. And for the first half of the year, all three of our end market segments are now in the double-digit range, right? So pharma is 14%, industrial and applied is at 12% and academic and government at 10%. So we see really broad-based demand across our end markets. And from a geographic perspective, again, nice momentum across the board. The U.S. and India sort of leading the chart. The U.S. at 14%, India at 24%. And very nice to see China really in the high single digits at 9%. And again, first half of the year, Americas at plus 20%; China, mid-teens; India, again, in the 20s. So really broad-based strength across customers and geography. And we see really no sign of any sort of slowdown. So maybe just one sort of summary comment on really the very precise and nice description that Amol has given. I mean our top line continues to do extremely well, right? And we've just guided to a double-digit growth for the full year after printing a 6% -- 16% growth for last year and then 16% in Q1, first half of the year in the teens. So top line momentum continues. This flows very nicely through the P&L. And the EPS on an organic basis is in the high teens, right, even for the full year in the guide, right? On an organic basis, it's in the high teens, which basically sets us up really well as we go into next year, right? And in our trends, in our sort of results, there is no benefit of COVID or M&A embedded, right? So it's a very clean number that you can build off for the next year and shows the strength of our business provided we continue to deliver on the top line. And with resilient end markets with great innovation and such a good team executing, we feel very good about where we stand. Luke, firstly, thank you for the question. I mean, we're very pleased with our performance. I'll start with the back end of your question and answer your instrument question as I go through the answer. Relatively speaking, when we look at our competitive environment, I mean, we're performing extremely well, right? And instrument has been a big -- instruments have been a big part of -- a big part of the story, where in the first half, as you mentioned, instruments are growing close to 20% and overall 13% or so growth and orders again being higher than sales. So yes, we read a lot about the macro challenges. But if you look at what we've been through from an execution perspective and now less than 2 years -- I joined slightly less than 2 years ago, we've gained our leading position, that, too, during a pandemic. Innovation is starting to contribute meaningfully to growth. So I have a lot of faith in the team that has been able to pull this off. So if at all there is a downturn, which we don't see from what we have as visibility to our end markets. And across our end markets, we are extremely well positioned. Even back in 2009, Waters was one of the few companies that showed a positive EPS growth. And today, we are even better positioned, right? So if you just look at our portfolio, at that point we had 40% recurring revenues, today, it's over 55%. Our end markets where we're seeing incredible strength, especially with large molecules in pharma, our end markets, we're over 60% levered towards pharma, and that, too, in late stages of pharma which is super resilient. In applied industrial and applied, over 50% is in food and environmental. And in the TA segment, more and more levered towards higher growth segments like batteries. So I feel extremely good about how we're positioned towards the -- in the end markets as well. And with such traction, even with such heavy headwinds from FX, we're able to deliver and commit to the EPS that we signed up for before. So feel extremely good about where we are. Now to your instrument question, look, historically, instruments, if you just look at Waters' history over the last 15 years, are 3% to 4% growers. We're clocking 19%. So it's naive to think that we will continue to be at 19% or so in instrument growth. So I'm sure it will slow down. But we have a lot left in the -- from the initiatives that we started with earlier in the year. The replacement cycle is still ongoing, we expect this to continue to go for the next 2 to 3 years. We see better and better attachment rates as a consequence. We've expanded into new segments with CDMOs and CXOs. So feel very good about where we are in the implementation of our initiatives and that continues to benefit the instrument growth rate. So in summary, to your instrument question, no, don't expect 19% growth forever, but do expect our initiatives to help us continue to drive higher than the 3% to 4% that we've seen historically. I hope that gives you more color. Yes. Firstly, incredibly proud of the team. I mean, if you'd asked me in April and May where we were going to land, I mean it was -- it was the headwinds that we talked about. In June, incredible, incredible performance from the teams to be able to ship the products that we did and get them to our customers. So I feel very good about what we achieved. And for the back half of the year, I mean, the full year, we think will be in the mid-teens for China. So no real slowdown. Again, strength across all end markets. And also in the TA business, right? So strength across, especially where we see our instrument replacement cycle doing very well, Arc HPLC doing very well. Increasingly the biopharmaceutical applications for our premier technology, ACQUITY Premier, doing very well. So across the board, China feels extremely good from a demand perspective. So mid-teens for the full year, barring any significant shutdowns in that geography. I mean it's a lumpy sort of environment, as you can see, quarter-to-quarter. But I mean, overall, look, 16% growth last year, mid-teens already at the middle point of this year, and we feel very good where we sit today. I mean, firstly, Dan, thank you for the question. Look, it's similar to what I just mentioned. I mean, let's just take each of the end markets in turn and the composition in each of the end markets, right? So in pharma in particular, amongst our peer group, we probably have the highest exposure to late-stage 1pharma QA/QC, which is -- which is more proportional to pill count. And recession or no recession, people don't stop taking medicines and they don't stop -- they don't want -- the pharma companies don't stop manufacturing their medicines. If anything, the R&D funding starts to slow down, right? So being levered more to QA/QC in pharma is very helpful, both in small and in large molecules. Second, if you look at our industrial and applied segment, over half of it is now food and environmental. Again, food safety, especially in our food PFAS testing with our renewed portfolio, is a strong, strong growth driver, both in food and environmental testing. And then in the TA business, that, too, starts to look quite different, right, with the batteries testing segment becoming larger and larger. So we're looking at more secular drivers across the end markets. And the growth is broad-based. The business is geographically quite disparate, right? So we have significant presence ex U.S., I mean, which, of course, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, we have to offset quite a significant FX impact. But it's much more diversified and it's much more helpful than when you see changes across different geographies happening at different pace. So feel really good about where we stand in terms of our end market exposure. Second, this market responds to innovation. And you've seen that already, right? So back when I joined less than two years ago, people were telling me, \"Hey, Waters is levered towards the small molecule QA/QC segment and this is commoditized.\" Well, we've just shown quite the opposite with Arc HPLC coming in, with better performance, without having our customers refile their processes and revalidate their testing and we've shown that segment grow. So this market responds to innovation, and we are in a very, very good place from an innovation standpoint. And finally and most importantly, we have a team here with us that has navigated through the pandemic, through macroeconomic challenges, while eight out of nine of us are now new in our seats, right? So I'm very, very confident that whatever the economy throws at us, we'll be able to deal with it. And we are in a very good position versus what you saw back in 2008 and 2009, even then Waters was able to navigate pretty, pretty effectively. I hope that gives you more color. Matt, thank you for the question. We're very happy with where we are with academic and government. I mean, first half of the year, double-digit growth. This quarter, 16% or so growth. But I'll remind you that this is a lumpy market and we have a low base from last year, right? So if you look at a three-year stack growth rate, we're roughly 40-ish percent inorganic growth rate in that segment. It's very heavily levered towards instruments and instruments did extremely well this quarter and the last quarter. So still rather volatile segment because -- or lumpy segment because of the heavy instrument portfolio that we have in that segment. That said, we are -- we have initiated our focus and our turnaround in that segment but we are far from done, right? So we still have work to do on increasing our e-commerce presence and e-procurement presence. I mean, that's going well but not yet done. From a commercial standpoint, we are reinitiating and -- reinitiating our KOL contracts which help with our high-resolution mass spec portfolio. Even though the portfolio is renewed, from a commercial standpoint, we still feel we have work to do. So while we are happy with the results, I would not declare victory yet. Yes. So Josh, thanks for the question. No pull forward, orders are still higher than sales. All end markets, as I said before, are doing -- doing well. So we feel good about where we stand from a demand perspective. And it's too early to talk about 2023, right? So there's a balance of the year to navigate in a turbulent environment. That said, the demand drivers are still there. Innovation is doing very well. And we feel that where -- our commercial presence is -- and our commercial execution is helping us grab opportunities and differentially so versus our competition. So thank you for the question, but no pull forward, feel very good about where we stand from a demand perspective. And then I think I didn't address your backlog question. I mean the backlog is at healthy levels, right? Waters did not have for a while, I would say, a healthy backlog. We feel more than feel at least a bit better that we have a reasonable backlog. It's not -- it's reasonable, but it's not super, super substantial, right? It's reasonable it allows us to navigate through any sort of turbulence. A lot of visibility into Q3, and we feel good again about how we will end the year. Rachel, thank you for the question. Really no impact that we have seen. No discussions from a customer perspective on what they're expecting. I'll remind you, we are, again, focused more on the late-stage part of -- late-stage part of the pharma value chain, right, QA/QC. And our costs are such a small portion of pharma, it usually does not impact us, right? So we don't expect that to be a discussion. COGS is such a small portion of most pharma companies sales that it's not a place where they look for costs. So we have not seen that in the past when pricing discussions have come up. And we don't expect it -- and we don't see any signals right now and we don't expect it to be in the future given that we're in the QA/QC domain in COGS is such a small portion of their cost base. Now in the early stages of research, perhaps there could be an impact, but we -- as I said, we're very levered towards QA/QC. I'll start off, Derik, and I'll let Amol comment a little bit on the FX piece as well. Really, India has been doing extremely well given the demand for small molecule production, again reviving, and some of this has to do with the government initiatives in India that were initiated last year and us being so heavily focused on that part of pharma, QA/QC for genetics, QA/QC for small molecules, in India, we've seen an outsized benefit and that's continued well into this year. So it's a fundamental demand driver that we can explain based on government policy and again driven heavily by instrument growth. Consumable is doing well but driven heavily by instrument growth. Amol, do you want to comment on the FX piece? Puneet, thanks for the question. Look, I mean, our capital allocation priorities remain the same. Growth is still where we are focused, right? And it starts with organic growth, right? So that's where we allocate capital first. And that is going extremely well. And we're funding internal innovation, we're funding our high-growth adjacencies, seeing really nice results. I was at AACC last week with the team on LC, MS for diagnostics, and there is a clear value proposition where as customers discover new biomarkers, mass spec has a meaningful role to play. And that reaffirmed -- we took our R&D team, we took our commercial team and we had many different workshops there with different customers. And so really feel good about what we're doing from an organic perspective and want to fund that set of adjacencies, bioseparations, analytical bioprocessing as well as batteries and LC, MS and diagnostics, so we want to fund that first. Second, from an M&A perspective, really what you should take away is, I mean, we are, of course, on the lookout for things that fit into our strategic priorities. But there's really no rush, right? I mean we've announced a few collaborations. They're going extremely well, especially the one with Sartorius on the bioanalytical characterization space, especially upstream. But really no rush. And from an M&A environment perspective, lots of discussions ongoing. We are, of course, on the lookout. But again, super financially disciplined, right? So really nothing has changed from the time we spoke. And as we have conversations, I mean, of course, people still have memories of their 52-week highs in certain areas, but look, our organic business is performing very well and the focus remains on that, on partnerships and we have a list of -- and a nice pipeline of M&A targets that we're looking at now constantly. No, absolutely, Brandon, thanks for following up on that. Look, it's a workhorse instrument in that segment. And now along with the instrument being upgraded, you also have the waters_connect software, which is a compliance software, that allows not only for us to introduce new applications, but allows us to transition methods from upstream more powerful tops [ph] to BioAccord directly downstream, right? So that's a significant benefit. And that product has done very well, right? It's already doing extremely well with our customers. I mean the orders are again outpacing the sales. I mean, within the first few days, significant backlog developed, right? So we feel very good about what we've done there. And as I said, it's not just the instrument being more powerful in those segments, but it's also the launch of the waters_connect software, the informatic software that allows for an easier transition into the BioAccord in late stages. So again, really consistent with our long-term strategy of doing analysis upstream and making it seamless for the customers to transfer that analytical method downstream, especially as you look at larger and larger molecules. Thanks for the question, Patrick. Look, I mean, again, it starts with the organic piece, right? So let's just take the bioseparations and the bioanalytical characterization, high-growth adjacencies, right? On the bioanalytical characterization adjacency, we started with our collaboration with Sartorius, with our work with the University of Delaware, developed a deep understanding of upstream bioprocessing, downstream bioprocessing. The team has taken and learned that area really well. And I insist, I mean, before we make any meaningful moves in that area, we must organically develop that business well. And I feel very good on what we've been able to do in the last year. Again, learning a lot from what Sartorius does, learning a lot from what's happening at University of Delaware. So significant resource allocation there. We're not -- we're not sparing any expense as that business grows. We've already developed 4 workflows for the BioAccord for upstream characterization and 1 that is doing extremely well is cell culture media analysis upstream for bioreactors. I mean, there are 3 or 4 other workflows that have also been implemented that have been received very well. So the organic part of the business is doing very well. Now if you look at the M&A aspects of it, that opens up a whole bunch of M&A ideas, right? I mean for sampling, for data analytics, for other analytical characterization methods in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. And you'll hear more about that as we go along. And now double-clicking on bioseparations. There, we have world-leading capabilities in separating small molecules. We've already developed some nice applications with the MaxPeak Premier technology with our columns, right? So to separate oligonucleotides, to separate larger molecules better. We think there's a long runway here organically. The team is being built up quite substantially on that front. But it also opens up avenues inorganically as we learn more about that segment. So it would be nice to be able to work with somebody who has deep capabilities in reagents that are larger molecules, right? And I think that's the sort of thing we're looking at really carefully. So the organic piece is first, it opens up, it educates us on what is possible. It opens up many possibilities and that's the sequence of events. And we are, as I mentioned earlier, quite active in that area. We have quite a few ideas. And they're in different stages of pursuit at this stage. Thank you very much, and thank you for all your questions. You'll agree with me that we've again had a tremendous quarter. The team continues to execute in a turbulent environment. And thank you for your participation. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Waters. Thank you, and have a wonderful day."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. Udit already covered the breakdown of our sales growth for the quarter, so I will now cover the remaining elements of our non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter was 57% and compared to 58.9% in the second quarter of 2021, driven primarily by foreign exchange headwinds from the strong U.S. dollar as well as higher instrument mix. Pricing for the quarter was over 300 basis points, successfully offsetting the impact of material and freight inflation. Operating margin for the quarter was 28.4% compared to 29.2% in the second quarter of 2021. This represents 70 basis points of margin expansion in constant currency before 150 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. For the first half of the year, operating margins have expanded 120 basis points before 80 basis points of foreign exchange headwind. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. Average share count came in at 60.5 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the second quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 6% to $2.75 in comparison to $2.60 last year. The foreign exchange headwind lowered our EPS growth by 11%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.72 compared to $2.69 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2022, free cash flow was $67 million after funding $39 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $11 million related to the investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations and a $38 million tax reform payment. Our free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by our proactive measures to secure supply and rebuild safety stock, resulting in a $40 million increase in inventory before exchange rates. Additionally, timing of shipments and installations, particularly in China, resulted in an 8-day increase of DSO to 81 days and an increase in accounts receivable of approximately $60 million before FX. We expect these dynamics to correct in the second half of the year as we have already observed an increase in collections in July. For the full year, we anticipate being close to our historical free cash flow conversion levels. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well-thought-out, attractive, high-growth, adjacent markets. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 479,000 shares of our common stock for $152 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.1 billion with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.1. Now as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've seen continued strong performance this year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across all our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect our solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives and innovation will provide a lasting contribution to our performance. We also expect to continue to successfully address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures, assuming these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 9.5% to 10.5% constant currency sales growth, up from our prior guide of 7.5% to 9%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 5 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 5.5%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be about 58% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5% as our resilient business momentum is able to mitigate the impact from exchange rates. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.4 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into the year and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Now rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share are now projected in the range of $11.95 to $12.05, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 9 percentage points. Currency impact is $0.56 incrementally more worse than our previous guide. However, our stronger-than-expected results for Q2 and our increased full year growth outlook are expected to offset the currency headwind. Looking to the third quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 8% to 10%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 6 percentage points, resulting in third quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 10 percentage points. Now I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. So let me take those 3 one by one. So on exchange rate, the full year guidance last time was about $0.45. Now it's 9% adverse, so $1.01. So incrementally $0.56 worse. And that plays out across our Q2, Q3 and Q4. And so if you see, we are covering that $0.55 with a better business performance. $0.33 -- $0.31 of that already came in Q2, because Q2 versus our previous guide, the exchange rates were worse off roughly by $0.18 and we delivered $0.15 higher than our guidance midpoint; so a total of $0.31. And then in Q3, when we guided last time, there was embedded assumption of $0.08 FX and now it's $0.26. So that sort of creates a $0.18 headwind on Q3 which is reflected in our guide for Q3. So that's the story on FX. Coming to gross margin, so look, I mean, typically, in the second half of the year, we have more sales and that reduces volume leverage, both in terms of our operations and absorption. And also in the first half of the year, 2 things happened, right? One, there was more activity around spot buys and that flowed through the P&L. We expect that activity to somewhat slow down. I mean the whole supply chain situation is improving but improving in baby steps. We are clearly not out of the woods, but it feels a little better than before. And the second piece is the exchange rates moved so quickly that you have transaction and translation gains and losses that also flowed through our cost of goods which is reflected in the gross margin. So net of those things, we think in the second half you will see a better impact on the gross margin side. And then the third question on the tax, yes, the tax rate for the first half of the year is lower than 15.5%, but that's driven by one-off discrete items which we don't think will repeat in the second half. And there will be some catch-up Q1 sort of how our phasing of the profit is across the year. So at this point, 15.5% is a prudent guidance for tax rate. Exactly. And just to build on that. The $0.55 sticks with us in the baseline and the $0.55 adverse effects, once the currencies recorrect, it will come back. Yes. Just one thing to add. Last year, we had shipment issue in Q3. And so close to $12 million of sales moved from Q3 to Q4. So the baseline for Q3 is somewhat lower. And so you will see a more pronounced growth in China in Q3 with a more subdued growth in Q4 because of last year's shipment dynamics. Look, our Q3 guide is 8% to 10%. Adjusted for the shipment issue is like 6% to 8%. The implied Q4 guide is sort of 5% to 7%. Adjusted for the shipment is 6% to 8%. So again, I mean, at this stage, we have visibility in our pipeline for Q3, Q4. We feel good about it. But at this stage, it's good to be prudent, especially for Q4. So we feel good about where the guide is at this stage. And our teams continue to execute flawlessly and continue to beat our expectations. Yes. No. And just to build on what Udit said, right? I mean we have a fantastic team in India. And if you go back to the second quarter of last year when India was going through a very tough COVID environment, the team executed flawlessly and had a great growth in second quarter of last year. So the baseline was already high. And then again, this year, you see 24% growth in the second quarter. So a lot of confidence in that team. And then when you couple that with how we've sort of handled pricing through inflation, we've provided excruciating detailed transparency to our customers on what's happening on the semiconductor side, on the freight side. And that's allowed us to have the customers share the burden of pricing. And I think the same processes that we build, the same systems that we build are going to start playing a role in explaining the impact of exchange rate and U.S. dollar and where our cost base lies. And I think not just India, but there are other markets that are impacted by this and our commercial teams are doing a great job of providing this transparency to the customer so that we can work this through hand in hand."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. During the course of this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results of the company and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2022 and full year 2022. We caution you that any and all such statements are only our present expectations and that actual events or results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. For a detailed discussion of some of the risks and contingencies that could cause our actual performance to differ significantly from our present expectations, see the risk factors included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, in Part 1 under the caption Risk Factors and the cautionary language included in this morning's press release, including with respect to risks related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We further caution you that the company does not intend to update any of its predictions or projections, except during our regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release conference calls and webcasts or as otherwise required by law. During today's call, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation which are available on the company's website. In our discussions of the results of operations, we may refer to non-GAAP results which exclude the impact of items such as those outlined in our schedule titled reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP financials included in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our presentation. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates, including revenue growth ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Udit Batra, Water's President and CEO. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We had a record start to the year with first quarter sales led by instruments which grew over 25% with a broad-based strong performance across all our end markets and geographies. Before summarizing the quarter, let me start by saying how extremely proud I am of our teams who've worked tirelessly to manage our supply chain, delivering operational excellence and exceptional support for our customers through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. It is a result of the indomitable spirit of all my colleagues at Waters. I will now provide a brief overview of our first quarter operating results and deliver our key messages. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Turning now to Slide 3. We have three key messages. First, we had a very good start to 2022 with great traction for our new instrument products, strong operational performance and sustained commercial momentum. Demand has remained robust across all our end markets. Second, we're laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make great progress in executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives positively impacting our results. We have a revitalized portfolio with innovation that is answering the needs of our customers in both large and small molecule workflows as well as our non -- as well as in our nonpharma markets such as food testing, environmental and material science. And thirdly, Waters has a firm commitment to leave the world better than we found it. We are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG programs. Now moving to Slide 4. In the first quarter, our revenue grew 13% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad growth across all our end markets and geographies. Orders in the quarter exceeded our sales of $691 million, reflecting a very strong demand. Instruments grew at 26% in constant currency, with strong growth across our LC mass spec and TA portfolios. New products contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter, with unit sales of Arc, HPLC and Acuity Premier more than tripling versus the first quarter of last year. In mass spec new instruments in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, such as our Xevo TQ-XS also saw strong growth in both industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Instrument strength is a positive indicator for future growth of our consumables and service revenues. Recurring revenues grew 9% for the quarter with chemistry up 8% and service up 9%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2021 which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Without that, recurring revenues would have also grown double digits. Our MAX peak premier columns have continued to strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, given the benefit this technology provides for novel modality applications and our increased exposure to biologics. Meanwhile, we're seeing increased service plan attachment rates in our key regions at instrument point of sale. By geography, growth was led by the Americas, with the U.S. up 28%, driven by broad performance in each of our end markets. In China, sales grew 17% with pharma, industrial and academic and government, all up double digits. As lockdowns in certain regions persist, we're beginning to see more of an impact to our business but we're in close contact with our customers and demand remains robust. Once the lockdowns ease, we expect activity levels to catch up that normalize with limited impact to our full year growth expectations for China. However, we anticipate some sales impact in the second quarter if customer access continues to be constrained. Our Q1 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.80, up 22% year-over-year, driven by sales growth, volume leverage and an ability to manage inflation through pricing. Given the global nature of our business, we're seeing ongoing supply constraints and inflationary pressures. Despite this, we have been successful in working through these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers while delivering good operating results. Turning now to Slide 5. While each of our initiatives continues to progress. The two areas I would like to highlight this quarter are contract organizations and launch excellence. For contract organizations, our unique technical abilities and ability to collaborate closely with our customers are resulting in market share gains and strong revenue growth. Revenues from these customers were up over 25% for this quarter lead by over 50% growth in China. Turning now to launch excellence. Our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth with demand, ramping for Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and MAX premier columns. ACQUITY Premier and MAX Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large, complex molecules. Our customers are using the technology for oligonucleotide analysis as well as separation and purification of novel modalities such as mRNA, peptides and glycans, just to name a few examples. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to purchase new capital equipment, including Arc HPLC. Now on Slide 6. We recently launched the Xevo TQ Absolute which is up to 15x more sensitive when analyzing negatively Ionized compounds compared to other tandem quads currently on the market, while also using less sample. It is designed to help pharmaceutical, food and environmental labs, meet regulations requiring trace-level quantitative mass spec analysis for a broad set of applications. In food testing, the instrument takes detection of anionic pesticides and their metabolites to a new level of quantitation. In pharma, it can provide highly sensitive analysis for oligonucleotides and peptide bioanalysis as well as quantification of estrogens in clinical research, uses for which high-resolution mass spec have typically been required. The instrument is highly efficient, using approximately 50% less electricity and gas and also producing 50% less heat than other high-performance standard quads in the market, both of which reduce the carbon footprint of analytical labs. It is also 50% smaller than other instruments in its class which also adds value to our customers as space and analytical labs is limited and costly. Our tandem quad portfolio was stronger than ever and together with Waters Connect, we're able to make customers' workflows easier, faster and more efficient without compromising performance. Now on Slide 7. Immerse Delaware, our second innovation and Research Lab will be opening tomorrow part of a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware. Its purpose is to develop analytical solutions to better characterize the manufacturing process for biologicals and novel modalities which will support our path into bioprocess characterization. Researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will develop solutions, including sensor and instrument improvements, data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to drive improvements in quality, yield and efficiency as well as characterize critical quality attributes that will be a key step towards separating the process from the product and biologics. On Slide 8, we are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG activities which continue to be recognized in a number of areas. Earlier this year, we achieved a score of 100 on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index earning Waters in designation as one of the best basis to work for LGBTQ+ equality. In addition, Barron's ranked Waters number 6 on its 100 most sustainable U.S. companies list for 2022 based on a set of 230 performance indicators and reflects our efforts of continuous improvement in social and environmental responsibility. On the list, we were the highest placed company in the health care sector and in the Life Science tools segment. Recently, within our diversity and inclusion and STEM education efforts, Waters has partnered with three historically black colleges and universities to create STEM opportunities for students through funding, instrument donations, mentoring and the awarding of scholarships to students exploring the analytical sciences. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and the results in revenue growth and operational performance which are demonstrating our continued success in our focus areas of execution, innovation and growth. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the first quarter financials as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $691 million in the first quarter, an increase of 16% in constant currency and an increase of 13% as reported. Looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 9, in constant currency, first by operating segment. Waters Division grew 16%, while TA grew by 18%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 19%. Industrial grew 17% and academic and government grew 4%. In Pharma, we saw broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications and in both large molecule and small molecule. Growth was led by the U.S. which was up over 35%. India, up just under 30%; and China which grew mid-teens. In Industrial, our performance was also strong across all major geographies, with U.S., Europe and China all growing 20% or above. Turning to academic and government. We saw a similar trend to last quarter with mid-single-digit growth as customer spending has become more active, led by China and the U.S. Now by geography, sales in Asia were up 14%, with China up 17%. The Americas grew 26% with the U.S. up 28%. And Europe grew 9%. In China, we saw broad performance across all our end markets which grew each up double digits. In the U.S., growth towards broad-based led by Pharma which was up almost 40%; and industrial which grew over 20%. Growth was very strong in both instrument sales which grew almost 60% and recurring revenues which grew in the mid-teens. In Europe, growth was led by Industrial which grew 20% and driven by strong growth in food and environmental. Sales of LC and MS instruments to pharma customers grew high teens as strong capital purchasing patterns continued on from last year. Udit already covered our growth by products and services, where instruments grew 26% for the quarter, chemistry grew 8% and service grew 9%, driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for our TA products continue to be strong in all regions, with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and sustainable polymers. Now, I would like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% and despite higher instrument mix, inflation pressures and stronger U.S. dollar. This was driven by volume leverage and pricing. Operating margin for the quarter increased by 170 basis points to 30.3%, driven by volume leverage on operating expenses. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%. Our average share count came in at 61 million shares which is about 1.7 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 22% to $2.80 in comparison to $2.29 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.62 compared to $2.37 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2022, free cash flow was about 25% of sales at $176 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $6 million relating to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. In the first quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 81 days, down three days compared to first quarter of last year. Given higher sales volume and our proactive measures to secure supply, including building some electronic component safety stock, Inventory increased by approximately $54 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out attractive, high market, high-growth adjusting opportunity. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 493,000 shares of our common stock for $160 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $941 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.9%. Now as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've had a strong start to the year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. We also expect that we will be able to continue to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 7.5% to 9% constant currency sales growth, up from our initial guide in February of 5% to 7%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58.5% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.6 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022 and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share guidance to the range of $11.90 to $12.10. This includes negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points or $0.45 at current rates. Looking at the second quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in second quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Given the ongoing lockdowns in China, we anticipate a headwind of approximately 100 to 200 basis points to our growth for the second quarter, assuming lockdowns do not worsen which is factored in our second quarter guidance. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 5 percentage points or $0.13 at current rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. So in summary, our teams continue to deliver excellent results despite the challenging environment with strong instrument growth and great traction for our new instrument products. We are laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make progress executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives delivering positively and contributing positively to our results. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a really strong Q1 share [ph]. Udit, maybe just diving into the performance within the Q. You noted new products in CROs. Maybe -- I guess what the market is trying to debate is there any pull forward of demand? Can you talk about your order books and when you say new products, it feels like this is incremental demand coming in and perhaps not a pull forward of demand. So if you could just talk through the drivers here in Q1 and what the -- how the order book is shaping up, that would be fantastic.\nUdit Batra: So thank you, Vijay. Really, really proud of what the team has been able to accomplish in the quarter. The simple answer to your question is no. Orders keep outpacing sales and that's happened this quarter as well. So we have a healthy backlog. Now turning to the overall growth and you can just look at the overall market and us in particular. I think some of our peers have reported analytical instrument sales in their segments sometime last week. And they're in the low double digits, so we're a bit higher than that. And that delta is largely attributed to, of course, the operational excellence -- the five [ph] initiatives that I mentioned in the past and really significant traction for our new products. In fact, Arc HPLC and Acuity Premier have had really outsized performance. In fact, the number of units were 3x as what we sold in last -- in the same quarter last year. And we continue to see very good traction for our MAX premier columns, really especially designed for large molecules and biologics where, as you know, the tailwind is very good for biologics. So overall, no pull forward of demand and new products substantially -- doing substantially well, really meeting a significant need in the market.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Udit. May be one for Amol on the guidance here, Amol. Revenues, you beat the Q by 800 basis points versus your prior guidance, right, $68 million for Q1 that annualizes to 200 basis points. You look at the annual guide raise, it was raised by 200 basis points. So I'm curious -- Udit just said, order book is trending well above revenue. So is that perhaps conservatism in a China lockdown or perhaps some macro? Maybe just talk about what the guide is assuming here for the year?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So thanks a lot, Vijay, for the question. So look, I mean, we are raising our full year guide by approximately 2% at constant currency. What is sort of dragging it down is how the U.S. dollar has moved between our last guide and this guide, right? So when we guided last in February, there was close to $25 million FX headwind on the full year revenue. Now it's at $85 million. So almost $60 million headwind coming in on top line. And likewise, on EPS, that is a $0.25 incremental headwind versus what we guided before because now the EPS headwind is at $0.45. So that's all factored into our guidance. Despite some of these challenging macroeconomic conditions, we are raising both our revenue guide and our EPS guide. What that does assume is 6% to 8% Q2 and sort of a 5% to 7% second half of the year. And again there, we are putting our guide prudently given the macroeconomic conditions and we continue to monitor that.\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Vijay, I think just maybe one other comment to build on this. Look, we're super, super pleased with what's happened in Q1. I think there will be no doubt about that. It's a broadly good performance across instruments, across consumables, across all geographies and end markets. That said, I mean, there are still geopolitical issues. There are still macroeconomic concerns and there are still supply chain challenges out there. And we feel that it's prudent to guide the way we have. And I think that's really what's going on into our -- in our mindset at this point. But it's still a raise even despite all those challenges, it's still a raise from what we have said in the past.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So first, could you just walk us through your latest at rent pricing for the year. You previously flagged about 150 bps but inflation continues to be a concern. So -- can you reach me on that this year at all? And then have you faced any pushed back from your customers on price increases at all so far?\nUdit Batra: Rachel, thank you for your question. Look, let's take a step back and I would just now think about pricing alone. We have -- our gross margin has gone up in the quarter by about 40 basis points and the operating margin, about 170 basis points, right? So that is the result of three things. One, of course, pricing which I'll get into in a minute but also productivity improvements and productivity due to a higher volume. And thirdly, new products, right, giving us even more leverage, right? So if I now just comment a bit more on the pricing. I mean we this quarter have seen about 200 basis points. And I'll also remind you that during this quarter, a lot of -- a fraction of the sales have come due to orders that were placed in Q3 and Q4 last year, where the pricing had not fully taken hold. So we feel very comfortable with where we are largely because we're collaborating very closely with our customers. I mean, there is a lot of conversation on pricing. Whenever we increase prices, there's a lot of discussion with our customers on why and what and where and when. So we feel reasonably comfortable that as long as our customers are aware of why we are doing, what we're doing and we're communicating transparently, we should be able to sustain the price increases.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then just another question on China here. So you flagged the 100 to 200 basis points of headwind in China during 2Q stemming from the current lockdown. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in that marketing or confidence and how quickly China can return to growth post lockdown? And then for China, you also flagged that CROs had over 50% growth year-over-year. So can you just spend a minute talking about what specifically drove that outpaced growth in the China CRO segment.\nUdit Batra: Thanks, Rachel. I mean China, look, despite the rolling lockdowns has been one of the brightest stars in our overall geographic performance. Broad-based growth, again, pharma and industrial both growing, so 17% growth for the quarter for China, led by pharma and industrial both in the mid-teens, even academic and government was in the low teens this particular quarter. So -- and the underlying demand is based on a lot of what we see globally. So great execution of our initiatives, including instrument replacement, including the -- the traction of our new products Arc HPLC and Acuity Premier in particular and really great demand for our products in the CDMO segment where we grew over 50%. And I'll remind you, the value proposition we offer is not just the products. It's really training our CDMO customers on method transfer and method development for complex molecules. So overall, the quarter has been great for China despite the fact that for the last week, we saw some headwinds for our recurring revenues when the access was limited. So really pleased with what we've been able to do. Now going forward, we anticipate 100 to 200 basis points of headwind in the second quarter, largely because the lockdowns are still sporadic and they're not over. We're starting to see them ease but it's very difficult to predict how open the market is going to be and how open the access is going to be. So while we are optimistic overall on China and we think we'll end the year with low double-digit to mid-double-digit growth, our mid-teen growth for the full year and we have -- we are really optimistic about the trends that we see in China. I think it's just prudent to sort of manage Q2 with 100 to 200 sort of basis points of a headwind versus what we've already seen in Q1. So I think -- I hope that gives you enough context, again, very optimistic about the market, really happy with the execution, both on new products and customer traction and in the long-term, super optimistic but in the short-term, a little bit careful about how we think about the market.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Dan Brennan of Cowen & Company.\nDan Brennan: Great. Congrats on, obviously, a very strong quarter. Maybe could you walk us through a little bit, Udit, on the instrument side, I don't know if you quantified what the new instrument impact was in the quarter. I know you spoke about year-over-year growth. But could you back up a little bit and just give us a sense of what the impact was? And also if you could remind us as we think about the new instruments and the opportunity, kind of what's baked in for 2022? And then kind of related to that, could you discuss -- I know you alluded to it earlier but can you discuss what you're seeing from an end market growth basis and a share gain basis?\nUdit Batra: Okay. So I'll take it one step at a time. And if I forget any I'm sure, Dan, you'll remind me that I won't answer your question fully. So overall instrument growth at 26%. We don't usually break down the contribution of new products to that. I mean you can imagine in the way I would just back out that number or back out new products and execution by just comparing it to the overall market. I think you'll agree with me that the 26% number really reflects a very, very strong performance versus what we're seeing from our peer group. And that has two contributions. One is the operational excellence, instrument replacement increase -- and increase in the traction of new products. And our new products, it's broad-based, right? It's not just LCs, it's also mass specs now, right? So from an LC perspective, you have Arc and Acuity Premier and Acuity Premier, in particular, really targeting biologics and novel modalities applications. Now you turn to the mass spec portfolio where we, of course, launched our MRT platform, really great feedback from customers. That's a high-resolution mass spec. But then the Xevo TQ-XS Absolute -- that we've just -- the Xevo TQ Absolute that we've just launched. And that has incredible traction and not surprisingly, right? It's 15x more sensitive than the leading mass spec on the market for anionic compounds and anionic compounds are ones that are ubiquitous in mRNA and oligonucleotides but also pesticides in food and environmental testing. So really a strong introduction. And what I'm most proud of is it's not just performance but it has a lower footprint and a lower environmental footprint. So 50% less consumption of electricity, 50% less generation of heat versus the top tandem quads in the market. So super optimistic about it. And in addition, it's not just the instruments that you sell, you also sell a full system with software, right? And we had introduced our new Waters connect mass quantitation software in the last few months, that has incredible traction. So not only are our customers getting a smaller box with a lower environmental footprint, they're getting better hardware performance and 50% more sensitivity for -- with our software. So it's an incredible new product in a space where, remember, we said there were about 800 or so tandem quads that we want to replace. So we feel very good about what we see as demand there. And I don't want to leave TA out. I mean, TA again, outperformed our Waters division and we're not competitive internally with each other. But just to remind you, TA grew 18%, Waters grew 16% with broad-based demand from -- for our thermal instruments, for our rheology instruments, -- but what I'm most excited about is what the TA team is doing, of course, operationally but also attacking new segments like battery testing. We have incredible demand for our products on that front -- it's off a small base, so I won't give you a number but it's off a small base but growing very rapidly. So very excited about new products and very good feedback overall and the 26% number sees that. And one other number that we've cited in the past is our new instrument Vitality Index which is basically taking the last three to four years of sales and saying how much contribute three to four years of launches and calculating how much contribution that has to our overall sales. And that number is at an all-time high at 15%. These new products are meeting the need but we also have a new process for launching the products and you've seen how we repositioned the BioAccord. So I think that was one part of your question. The second part, I think you referred to as from an end market perspective, look, no real weakness this quarter, right? So you see pharma, again, doing extremely well with high-teens growth industrial also high-teens growth and academic and government coming in at 4%. So we really feel good about all end markets across different geographies. And I think from a geographic standpoint, I would point out that, of course, China is doing well despite difficult conditions. India is still in the mid-20s in terms of growth and we saw that all through last year. What I'm most excited about is what we see in the U.S. I mean, when was the last time you saw 29% growth from Waters in the United States? And as the U.S. goes, so does our gross margin because the pricing in the U.S. is a bit better, as you can imagine. So we feel extremely good about the quarter and I hope I have addressed your questions.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Josh Waldman, Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: One for Amol and then one for Udit. Amol, I wondered if you could provide a bit more color on the moving pieces in the updated EPS guide, there may be a full bridge. I mean just trying to get a better sense on how variables beyond FX, like the stronger revenue, improved margin outlook were factored into the guide and maybe if there are other offsets going on beyond FX?\nAmol Chaubal: Sure. Thanks, Josh. So look at it from two vantage points, right? So on a full year basis, we are raising our EPS guidance but that does include a $0.25 incremental headwind versus the guide that we provided in February. And so in a way, if you say, look, we beat consensus in Q1 by about $0.45, $0.25 of that is lost in year to go in sort in FX and the rest of it, we are increasing our guide on EPS, plus or minus a little bit of spending timing switching between Q1 to Q2. So it's largely consistent with how we are guiding full year revenue increase and most of the gap is largely driven by change in FX assumptions.\nJosh Waldman: Okay. And then Udit, maybe a follow-up on Vijay's question. Can you talk a bit about pacing in the first quarter and maybe how sales track versus order intake rates? Is it fair to assume that we have the 16% organic growth, you saw some relief on the supply chain side and we're able to work down backlog or have orders remained such that your backlog continues to be at kind of an elevated level entering 2Q maybe similar to where it was as you entered the first quarter.\nUdit Batra: In fact, Josh, thank you for the question. But in fact, the orders outpaced the sales yet again, right? So the backlog continues to build. So the fact we did not have to draw down the backlog to achieve the incredible results that you saw in the quarter. If anything, I would attribute, of course, it to the operational performance in the quarter and really the strong dedication of our teams. And this question keeps coming up, how did you deal with the supply chain issues? So I will not sit here and tell you that it's all over, yes. And that we are after three quarters of dealing with the supply chain challenges. We know exactly what to do. But we have an algorithm and I'm knocking on wood while I say this, that seems to work. Number one, we have really spent a lot of time studying the supply chain of key materials, including semiconductors and what additional materials that are based on this -- on the chips industry that go into our instruments. And so we have a deeper understanding of the supply chain to produce these semiconductors, the Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 suppliers. Second, we've invested a ton of time on collaboration, right? So I have personally met the Top 7 suppliers of chips that go into our instruments. We have incredible collaboration across Waters. I mean it's a -- I mean I like to call it as -- I like to call Waters as a large startup where we have deep relationships that have been built over many, many years and they help us in times that are difficult. And we have collaboration with our customers. So often, we will have a conversation with our customers if something is short on supply. We will basically try to substitute it with something else. And then finally, third piece is collaborative problem solving, right? When you build these relationships, it's easier to solve problems with folks when you get into trouble, right? So -- and it's not just true within the organization, we're sitting down with customers asking what should be replaced with what rebuilding some of the chips, moving ethernet ports from one location to the other. I won't get into more details. And all of us are on the ground floor. This is not a spectator sport, right? Amol, me and lot of our senior leaders across the board, we are on the ground floor talking to our customers. So it's really I would say, operational excellence, deep collaboration and an understanding -- and a deeper understanding of the full supply chain, really not -- didn't have to tap into the backlog to achieve these results. I hope that gives you more color.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Puneet Souda, SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: Really impressive growth here in instruments indeed. Maybe, Udit, just pulling back to a higher level, when you look at the pharma and the 29% growth number that you mentioned in U.S. What is driving this demand when you talk to the customers, modalities, specifically more importantly, are you seeing this demand come from new facilities expansion among CDMOs or versus the demand from the existing facilities because obviously, you are outpacing what the demand would -- I mean, the strength we're seeing from peers as well, the peers are growing but you guys are obviously ahead of that. So just trying to understand at a high level, what is the sort of the dynamic across pharma and given the backdrop of these macroeconomic environment right now?\nUdit Batra: Thanks for the question, Puneet, it's really broad-based. But it, again, starts with operational excellence. I mean, the five initiatives that we've mentioned earlier we have a new-ish leader in the United States. Our sales has a long tenure in Waters but he was newly appointed right before I got here. And he's just been incredible with his team, right? We've put more feet on the street. We have been using our CRM system really religiously to get an understanding of where the demand is. And there was a replacement backlog built up in the U.S. for our instruments. The new products have done extremely well. E-commerce is doing better in the U.S. than anywhere else and the CMO traction is very, very good in the U.S. Turning then to new products. I mean you're well aware, these new products have been designed specifically for our biologics customers, right? And we start with the BioAccord which I know you know extremely well. We repositioned the product to go upstream into clone selection and that's gaining a ton of traction. Downstream in QA/QC, the work that we started about two years ago with several large pharma players who have significant monoclonal antibody pipelines, we're seeing them gain -- seeing the product gain traction in QA/QC and that bodes well for the future. Second, MAX peak columns and Acuity Premier as a technology was custom designed for biologics that have affinity to metal surfaces. And that product -- that set of products has gained a ton of traction. And most recently, the Xevo TQ Absolute. I mean it has terrific performance as hardware and lower environmental footprint. So all of that combined, meaning operational excellence, new products, a leader who's really sort of embraced collaboration and embraced the operational excellence is really what's behind the U.S. doing as well as it does. And that, of course, has an impact on the gross margin as well.\nPuneet Souda: That's great. And then a brief follow-up on the BioAccord actually. We recognize that the field team was doing a number of demos throughout the quarter in the last couple of months for BioAccord and bioprocessing applications and you're obviously highlighting the University of Delaware work that you're doing here with the new center. Maybe just help us understand when should we start to think about meaningful contribution from some of the new bioseparations initiatives and broadly bioprocessing customers, taking on BioAccord?\nUdit Batra: Puneet, I'll repeat what I've said also in the last quarter. I mean we've basically said, look, in the short-term, you should expect us to grow 5% to 7%, about a 1% impact of our five initiatives. And in the midterm 2024 onwards, you should see Waters going to the sort of range where you should start to see an impact of these new initiatives, right? And is it a bit sooner? Is it a bit later? I mean, I can't be more precise. All I can tell you is there's a ton of traction and just staying with the bioseparations area, just staying with the BioAccord in particular, there's a ton of traction for what we're doing with Sartorius, for clone selection. The BioAccord, just as it was initially designed has sort two very large applications. The first is on spent medium where we can analyze close to 200 analytes. So our customers in that category are interested in a simple instrument but they don't want to give up any of the sophistication. They don't want to look at five compounds and 15 compounds. They still want to look at 200 compounds because they are still trying to ascertain at that point which of these -- what race quantities of materials are going to impact their cell culture. So BioAccord is simple to use but a highly sophisticated instrument. And I think that's really important to keep in mind when you think about spend media. And then, the other application is on peptide mapping and the drug substance itself, the whole drug substance. And there, again, the applications are very wide. And here, where Waters has an advantage is with our ability to develop simple workflows, right? So our customers, again, are not willing to give up the sophistication. They want to know each amino acid in the sequence of the peptide, they want to know the confirmation. They want to know the size of the molecule. They don't want to give up any information. They want the instrument to be simple to use, the workflow to be simple to use and we're developing a whole bunch of workflows on that front. And again, feel extremely good about it. As I said, mid -- you should -- in the midterm, you should expect 100 basis points of sort of growth impact based on all the sort of adjacencies that I've talked about in the past. I can't be no precise on that but I can tell you there's a lot of excitement amongst our team and the customers in applications of bioseparations as well as bioprocessing.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Congrats on the quarter. Udit, maybe just big picture first question. I mean one of the things that you did earlier in 10 year was to try to bring the R&D and commercial functions closer together? And then noticing how the new instrument demand has really picked up and pretty successful launches. How much do you attribute to the success of these new products to some of the reorganization you did within the R&D commercial teams? And how much more there to go for in bringing those two close together? Like should we look for increased momentum with the new products because of the changes that you made?\nUdit Batra: It's a great question and thanks for asking a more sort of qualitative question. Look, I mean, it's a question of collaboration, right? I mean Waters is known for its technical excellence and closeness to customers. But I think by bringing the commercial team closer to our development colleagues, we're now as we think through our launch process and Jon Pratt will talk to you a bit more about it in our Investor Day in a few weeks. As we brought these two teams together, we're able to bring the commercial input much sooner into development, number one. Number two, there's a lot more ownership from our commercial teams, not just the understanding but also a lot more ownership from our commercial teams as we launch the new products. And without a doubt, that has a lot to do with the traction we've seen with the MAX peak premier columns. The sales team are super excited the Acuity Premier, the Arc HPLC which was a demand or a request from our customers through our sales team and the R&D teams responded to it. And now as they are closer together, they sit in operational reviews together. I chair and Innovation Board where we have both commercial as well as R&D input. And I can tell you that has a significant amount to do with how we are seeing new products pick up in the market and the feedback, right? So I mean, in this space, you don't expect to hit a home run in the first day that you go out to bat, right? So you basically have to get feedback from our from the customers and those -- that feedback goes back into R&D seamlessly, right? And the best example of that is our software launch, right? We launched our [indiscernible] one application for -- with Waters Connect, basically a compliant compliant-ready software. And some of the customers wanted enterprise capabilities with that software. So our development team got that feedback very early on and has developed the solution. Same is true with BioAccord. Early on, we went head first into QA/QC that was a few years ago. Now with closer collaboration between commercial and R&D sitting at the same table as the customers come back and say, \"Hey, I want a simpler workflow for oligos because that's my pipeline or I want a simpler workflow for spend media. That's what the R&D team focuses on optimizing. So it's -- I could go on and on. I mean, it's incredibly exciting. And as a former researcher myself, I find the discussions very pragmatic, hugely collaborative and a learning experience for both parties, both commercial as well as R&D.\nMatt Sykes: Great. And then just quickly, just to maybe on the academic end market. Just talk about trends you're seeing there. You had some pretty strong growth in China. But maybe ex-China, what you're seeing in the academic end market in this quarter? And what you're looking for, for this year?\nUdit Batra: So academic and government did especially well both in the U.S. and in China. And I would separate the two things, right? I mean again, I mean, we are -- while we have performed in line with many of the peers we've already reported with academic and government, I don't want you to assume that our turnaround in academic and government is finished, right? We have just begun remapping the KOLs, we started to work much harder on the e-procurement e-commerce availability for academic institutions. So there's a lot more to go. But the U.S. and China did super well in the first quarter. And the U.S., in particular, had a lot of traction, again by putting more feet on the street by talking to customers more directly. China benefited from the VAT -- the VAT expense or the VAT regulation being relieved a little bit step by step, right, so the customers are purchasing from what they had in the past. I would not assume that we've already turned the corner there, right? While we have good results this quarter, we are still working on it. And so I expect more from that segment.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to ask about recurring sales. Just given the instrument upside in the first quarter, what does guidance now assume for chemistry sales for the remainder of the year? I was curious whether you think some of this bolus of upside here could have some carry through on the recurring growth expectations?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Jack, great question. I mean the instrument growth will continue to drive recurring revenue growth, both chemistry and service. At this point, our guidance sort of assumes service and chemistry would be around high single digits, low double digits for the second half of the year. But again, I mean, this thing is not just here and now, right? These instruments will continue to produce revenue for the next seven, eight years. And the way we are performing on instrument replacement, we also think our instruments are recurring revenue because we've now built muscle strength and systems and processes so that the entire organization looks at instruments as a requiring revenue.\nAmol Chaubal: And then, look, I mean, there to -- historically, we've seen recurring revenues slightly higher than mid-single digits in the best years of Waters. And we've now for few quarters running in double digits or low double digits, right? So even this quarter, if you account for the one day fewer than the previous year, recurring revenues would be almost 10%, right? So we feel extremely good about it. In particular, the new product contribution and what we're seeing from our service team, right? So the new product contribution being MAX Peak Premier and a very rich pipeline that is specifically targeted towards large molecules, I mean what -- - is the world leader in separations and we are really turning our attention to complex large molecules, collaborating with our customers. And on the service side, remember we talked about increased attachment rates. That is also -- that is continuing to contribute and our attachment rates for our service. Services are increasing. So it's not just the translation of instruments to consumables and service. It's also unique contributions of new products and interesting innovation on the service side. So really excited. I mean, as I said, couldn't be prouder of the team across the board, there's been great performance.\nUdit Batra: And plus e-commerce is accretive and CDMOs are high volume. So they are all adding up to recurring revenue.\nOperator: And our last question is coming from Dan Arias of Stifel.\nDan Arias: Amol, just as a follow-up to the things that you've done on the supply chain, how much inventory safety stock on critical components would you say you have at this point?\nAmol Chaubal: It's a great question and a tough one, Dan. I mean, we try to build safety stock wherever we can find the inventory. The situation on electronic components hasn't improved any bit versus Q4 or Q1. It's a five day in, day out. So I mean part of that is in the $54 million or so that the inventory has gone up. But there are components where we have a production plan in Q2, likely for a demand plan in Q3 where we may be missing components still and we continue to try to solve these problems either with the suppliers or with the market or through innovative engineering. So -- if you were to assume everything is solid and in inventory, we are far from a that's a story with everybody. I mean what life science tools buys from electronic component suppliers is less than probably single-digit percentage of their annual production. So in a way, everybody is in the same Q behind cellular networks and vehicles, right? So the fight is on and we continue to navigate it day in and day out.\nUdit Batra: Yes. And Dan, it's an excellent question. Look, as Amol summarize, it's a deeper understanding of the supply chain, not just ours but also the chips and who else is getting them [indiscernible] in a lot of discussions across Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, many top-to-top conversations and then finally, collaboration and creative problem solving. I mean that's what's gotten us this far. And our teams are continuing to do it, the fights far from over, right? I mean we see it still out there. But I think if there is an algorithm, again, as I said earlier, knock on wood, as I said, we seem to have something in our hands and our teams are dedicated to solving these problems. Let me now thank you for your participation. And on behalf of Waters' management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and your interest. I would also like to make you aware that we are hosting our 2022 Investor Day in just over two weeks on May 19 in New York City at the New York Stock Exchange, starting at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The main presentation from the event at 10 a.m. will be broadcast -- will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website. If you would like to join us in person for the event, please reach out to our IR team via the contact details on Slide 13. Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar and good morning, everyone. Along with Caspar, joining me on this morning's call is Amol Chaubal, Water's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We had a record start to the year with first quarter sales led by instruments which grew over 25% with a broad-based strong performance across all our end markets and geographies. Before summarizing the quarter, let me start by saying how extremely proud I am of our teams who've worked tirelessly to manage our supply chain, delivering operational excellence and exceptional support for our customers through the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. It is a result of the indomitable spirit of all my colleagues at Waters. I will now provide a brief overview of our first quarter operating results and deliver our key messages. Amol will then review our financial results in detail and provide comments on our financial outlook. We will then open up the phone lines to take your questions. Turning now to Slide 3. We have three key messages. First, we had a very good start to 2022 with great traction for our new instrument products, strong operational performance and sustained commercial momentum. Demand has remained robust across all our end markets. Second, we're laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make great progress in executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives positively impacting our results. We have a revitalized portfolio with innovation that is answering the needs of our customers in both large and small molecule workflows as well as our non -- as well as in our nonpharma markets such as food testing, environmental and material science. And thirdly, Waters has a firm commitment to leave the world better than we found it. We are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG programs. Now moving to Slide 4. In the first quarter, our revenue grew 13% as reported and 16% on a constant currency basis, reflecting broad growth across all our end markets and geographies. Orders in the quarter exceeded our sales of $691 million, reflecting a very strong demand. Instruments grew at 26% in constant currency, with strong growth across our LC mass spec and TA portfolios. New products contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter, with unit sales of Arc, HPLC and Acuity Premier more than tripling versus the first quarter of last year. In mass spec new instruments in our high-end tandem quad portfolio, such as our Xevo TQ-XS also saw strong growth in both industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Instrument strength is a positive indicator for future growth of our consumables and service revenues. Recurring revenues grew 9% for the quarter with chemistry up 8% and service up 9%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2021 which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Without that, recurring revenues would have also grown double digits. Our MAX peak premier columns have continued to strength and incremental growth to our chemistry business, given the benefit this technology provides for novel modality applications and our increased exposure to biologics. Meanwhile, we're seeing increased service plan attachment rates in our key regions at instrument point of sale. By geography, growth was led by the Americas, with the U.S. up 28%, driven by broad performance in each of our end markets. In China, sales grew 17% with pharma, industrial and academic and government, all up double digits. As lockdowns in certain regions persist, we're beginning to see more of an impact to our business but we're in close contact with our customers and demand remains robust. Once the lockdowns ease, we expect activity levels to catch up that normalize with limited impact to our full year growth expectations for China. However, we anticipate some sales impact in the second quarter if customer access continues to be constrained. Our Q1 non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $2.80, up 22% year-over-year, driven by sales growth, volume leverage and an ability to manage inflation through pricing. Given the global nature of our business, we're seeing ongoing supply constraints and inflationary pressures. Despite this, we have been successful in working through these challenges, leveraging our global manufacturing footprint and working closely with our customers and suppliers while delivering good operating results. Turning now to Slide 5. While each of our initiatives continues to progress. The two areas I would like to highlight this quarter are contract organizations and launch excellence. For contract organizations, our unique technical abilities and ability to collaborate closely with our customers are resulting in market share gains and strong revenue growth. Revenues from these customers were up over 25% for this quarter lead by over 50% growth in China. Turning now to launch excellence. Our revitalized portfolio is contributing to growth with demand, ramping for Arc HPLC, ACQUITY Premier and MAX premier columns. ACQUITY Premier and MAX Premier were specifically designed to solve challenges that are particularly relevant for large, complex molecules. Our customers are using the technology for oligonucleotide analysis as well as separation and purification of novel modalities such as mRNA, peptides and glycans, just to name a few examples. Meanwhile, small molecule growth remains solid with customers continuing to purchase new capital equipment, including Arc HPLC. Now on Slide 6. We recently launched the Xevo TQ Absolute which is up to 15x more sensitive when analyzing negatively Ionized compounds compared to other tandem quads currently on the market, while also using less sample. It is designed to help pharmaceutical, food and environmental labs, meet regulations requiring trace-level quantitative mass spec analysis for a broad set of applications. In food testing, the instrument takes detection of anionic pesticides and their metabolites to a new level of quantitation. In pharma, it can provide highly sensitive analysis for oligonucleotides and peptide bioanalysis as well as quantification of estrogens in clinical research, uses for which high-resolution mass spec have typically been required. The instrument is highly efficient, using approximately 50% less electricity and gas and also producing 50% less heat than other high-performance standard quads in the market, both of which reduce the carbon footprint of analytical labs. It is also 50% smaller than other instruments in its class which also adds value to our customers as space and analytical labs is limited and costly. Our tandem quad portfolio was stronger than ever and together with Waters Connect, we're able to make customers' workflows easier, faster and more efficient without compromising performance. Now on Slide 7. Immerse Delaware, our second innovation and Research Lab will be opening tomorrow part of a multiyear collaboration with the University of Delaware. Its purpose is to develop analytical solutions to better characterize the manufacturing process for biologicals and novel modalities which will support our path into bioprocess characterization. Researchers from both Waters and the University of Delaware will develop solutions, including sensor and instrument improvements, data analytics and process control. This partnership will help us expand our capabilities to drive improvements in quality, yield and efficiency as well as characterize critical quality attributes that will be a key step towards separating the process from the product and biologics. On Slide 8, we are delivering sustainable value to our shareholders and stakeholders through our ESG activities which continue to be recognized in a number of areas. Earlier this year, we achieved a score of 100 on the 2022 Corporate Equality Index earning Waters in designation as one of the best basis to work for LGBTQ+ equality. In addition, Barron's ranked Waters number 6 on its 100 most sustainable U.S. companies list for 2022 based on a set of 230 performance indicators and reflects our efforts of continuous improvement in social and environmental responsibility. On the list, we were the highest placed company in the health care sector and in the Life Science tools segment. Recently, within our diversity and inclusion and STEM education efforts, Waters has partnered with three historically black colleges and universities to create STEM opportunities for students through funding, instrument donations, mentoring and the awarding of scholarships to students exploring the analytical sciences. In summary, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and the results in revenue growth and operational performance which are demonstrating our continued success in our focus areas of execution, innovation and growth. With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Amol for a deeper review of the first quarter financials as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. Amol? Thank you, Amol. So in summary, our teams continue to deliver excellent results despite the challenging environment with strong instrument growth and great traction for our new instrument products. We are laser focused on execution, innovation and growth. We continue to make progress executing against our enterprise priorities with our core initiatives delivering positively and contributing positively to our results. With that, we will now begin the Q&A session. Operator? So thank you, Vijay. Really, really proud of what the team has been able to accomplish in the quarter. The simple answer to your question is no. Orders keep outpacing sales and that's happened this quarter as well. So we have a healthy backlog. Now turning to the overall growth and you can just look at the overall market and us in particular. I think some of our peers have reported analytical instrument sales in their segments sometime last week. And they're in the low double digits, so we're a bit higher than that. And that delta is largely attributed to, of course, the operational excellence -- the five [ph] initiatives that I mentioned in the past and really significant traction for our new products. In fact, Arc HPLC and Acuity Premier have had really outsized performance. In fact, the number of units were 3x as what we sold in last -- in the same quarter last year. And we continue to see very good traction for our MAX premier columns, really especially designed for large molecules and biologics where, as you know, the tailwind is very good for biologics. So overall, no pull forward of demand and new products substantially -- doing substantially well, really meeting a significant need in the market. Yes. So Vijay, I think just maybe one other comment to build on this. Look, we're super, super pleased with what's happened in Q1. I think there will be no doubt about that. It's a broadly good performance across instruments, across consumables, across all geographies and end markets. That said, I mean, there are still geopolitical issues. There are still macroeconomic concerns and there are still supply chain challenges out there. And we feel that it's prudent to guide the way we have. And I think that's really what's going on into our -- in our mindset at this point. But it's still a raise even despite all those challenges, it's still a raise from what we have said in the past. Rachel, thank you for your question. Look, let's take a step back and I would just now think about pricing alone. We have -- our gross margin has gone up in the quarter by about 40 basis points and the operating margin, about 170 basis points, right? So that is the result of three things. One, of course, pricing which I'll get into in a minute but also productivity improvements and productivity due to a higher volume. And thirdly, new products, right, giving us even more leverage, right? So if I now just comment a bit more on the pricing. I mean we this quarter have seen about 200 basis points. And I'll also remind you that during this quarter, a lot of -- a fraction of the sales have come due to orders that were placed in Q3 and Q4 last year, where the pricing had not fully taken hold. So we feel very comfortable with where we are largely because we're collaborating very closely with our customers. I mean, there is a lot of conversation on pricing. Whenever we increase prices, there's a lot of discussion with our customers on why and what and where and when. So we feel reasonably comfortable that as long as our customers are aware of why we are doing, what we're doing and we're communicating transparently, we should be able to sustain the price increases. Thanks, Rachel. I mean China, look, despite the rolling lockdowns has been one of the brightest stars in our overall geographic performance. Broad-based growth, again, pharma and industrial both growing, so 17% growth for the quarter for China, led by pharma and industrial both in the mid-teens, even academic and government was in the low teens this particular quarter. So -- and the underlying demand is based on a lot of what we see globally. So great execution of our initiatives, including instrument replacement, including the -- the traction of our new products Arc HPLC and Acuity Premier in particular and really great demand for our products in the CDMO segment where we grew over 50%. And I'll remind you, the value proposition we offer is not just the products. It's really training our CDMO customers on method transfer and method development for complex molecules. So overall, the quarter has been great for China despite the fact that for the last week, we saw some headwinds for our recurring revenues when the access was limited. So really pleased with what we've been able to do. Now going forward, we anticipate 100 to 200 basis points of headwind in the second quarter, largely because the lockdowns are still sporadic and they're not over. We're starting to see them ease but it's very difficult to predict how open the market is going to be and how open the access is going to be. So while we are optimistic overall on China and we think we'll end the year with low double-digit to mid-double-digit growth, our mid-teen growth for the full year and we have -- we are really optimistic about the trends that we see in China. I think it's just prudent to sort of manage Q2 with 100 to 200 sort of basis points of a headwind versus what we've already seen in Q1. So I think -- I hope that gives you enough context, again, very optimistic about the market, really happy with the execution, both on new products and customer traction and in the long-term, super optimistic but in the short-term, a little bit careful about how we think about the market. Okay. So I'll take it one step at a time. And if I forget any I'm sure, Dan, you'll remind me that I won't answer your question fully. So overall instrument growth at 26%. We don't usually break down the contribution of new products to that. I mean you can imagine in the way I would just back out that number or back out new products and execution by just comparing it to the overall market. I think you'll agree with me that the 26% number really reflects a very, very strong performance versus what we're seeing from our peer group. And that has two contributions. One is the operational excellence, instrument replacement increase -- and increase in the traction of new products. And our new products, it's broad-based, right? It's not just LCs, it's also mass specs now, right? So from an LC perspective, you have Arc and Acuity Premier and Acuity Premier, in particular, really targeting biologics and novel modalities applications. Now you turn to the mass spec portfolio where we, of course, launched our MRT platform, really great feedback from customers. That's a high-resolution mass spec. But then the Xevo TQ-XS Absolute -- that we've just -- the Xevo TQ Absolute that we've just launched. And that has incredible traction and not surprisingly, right? It's 15x more sensitive than the leading mass spec on the market for anionic compounds and anionic compounds are ones that are ubiquitous in mRNA and oligonucleotides but also pesticides in food and environmental testing. So really a strong introduction. And what I'm most proud of is it's not just performance but it has a lower footprint and a lower environmental footprint. So 50% less consumption of electricity, 50% less generation of heat versus the top tandem quads in the market. So super optimistic about it. And in addition, it's not just the instruments that you sell, you also sell a full system with software, right? And we had introduced our new Waters connect mass quantitation software in the last few months, that has incredible traction. So not only are our customers getting a smaller box with a lower environmental footprint, they're getting better hardware performance and 50% more sensitivity for -- with our software. So it's an incredible new product in a space where, remember, we said there were about 800 or so tandem quads that we want to replace. So we feel very good about what we see as demand there. And I don't want to leave TA out. I mean, TA again, outperformed our Waters division and we're not competitive internally with each other. But just to remind you, TA grew 18%, Waters grew 16% with broad-based demand from -- for our thermal instruments, for our rheology instruments, -- but what I'm most excited about is what the TA team is doing, of course, operationally but also attacking new segments like battery testing. We have incredible demand for our products on that front -- it's off a small base, so I won't give you a number but it's off a small base but growing very rapidly. So very excited about new products and very good feedback overall and the 26% number sees that. And one other number that we've cited in the past is our new instrument Vitality Index which is basically taking the last three to four years of sales and saying how much contribute three to four years of launches and calculating how much contribution that has to our overall sales. And that number is at an all-time high at 15%. These new products are meeting the need but we also have a new process for launching the products and you've seen how we repositioned the BioAccord. So I think that was one part of your question. The second part, I think you referred to as from an end market perspective, look, no real weakness this quarter, right? So you see pharma, again, doing extremely well with high-teens growth industrial also high-teens growth and academic and government coming in at 4%. So we really feel good about all end markets across different geographies. And I think from a geographic standpoint, I would point out that, of course, China is doing well despite difficult conditions. India is still in the mid-20s in terms of growth and we saw that all through last year. What I'm most excited about is what we see in the U.S. I mean, when was the last time you saw 29% growth from Waters in the United States? And as the U.S. goes, so does our gross margin because the pricing in the U.S. is a bit better, as you can imagine. So we feel extremely good about the quarter and I hope I have addressed your questions. In fact, Josh, thank you for the question. But in fact, the orders outpaced the sales yet again, right? So the backlog continues to build. So the fact we did not have to draw down the backlog to achieve the incredible results that you saw in the quarter. If anything, I would attribute, of course, it to the operational performance in the quarter and really the strong dedication of our teams. And this question keeps coming up, how did you deal with the supply chain issues? So I will not sit here and tell you that it's all over, yes. And that we are after three quarters of dealing with the supply chain challenges. We know exactly what to do. But we have an algorithm and I'm knocking on wood while I say this, that seems to work. Number one, we have really spent a lot of time studying the supply chain of key materials, including semiconductors and what additional materials that are based on this -- on the chips industry that go into our instruments. And so we have a deeper understanding of the supply chain to produce these semiconductors, the Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 suppliers. Second, we've invested a ton of time on collaboration, right? So I have personally met the Top 7 suppliers of chips that go into our instruments. We have incredible collaboration across Waters. I mean it's a -- I mean I like to call it as -- I like to call Waters as a large startup where we have deep relationships that have been built over many, many years and they help us in times that are difficult. And we have collaboration with our customers. So often, we will have a conversation with our customers if something is short on supply. We will basically try to substitute it with something else. And then finally, third piece is collaborative problem solving, right? When you build these relationships, it's easier to solve problems with folks when you get into trouble, right? So -- and it's not just true within the organization, we're sitting down with customers asking what should be replaced with what rebuilding some of the chips, moving ethernet ports from one location to the other. I won't get into more details. And all of us are on the ground floor. This is not a spectator sport, right? Amol, me and lot of our senior leaders across the board, we are on the ground floor talking to our customers. So it's really I would say, operational excellence, deep collaboration and an understanding -- and a deeper understanding of the full supply chain, really not -- didn't have to tap into the backlog to achieve these results. I hope that gives you more color. Thanks for the question, Puneet, it's really broad-based. But it, again, starts with operational excellence. I mean, the five initiatives that we've mentioned earlier we have a new-ish leader in the United States. Our sales has a long tenure in Waters but he was newly appointed right before I got here. And he's just been incredible with his team, right? We've put more feet on the street. We have been using our CRM system really religiously to get an understanding of where the demand is. And there was a replacement backlog built up in the U.S. for our instruments. The new products have done extremely well. E-commerce is doing better in the U.S. than anywhere else and the CMO traction is very, very good in the U.S. Turning then to new products. I mean you're well aware, these new products have been designed specifically for our biologics customers, right? And we start with the BioAccord which I know you know extremely well. We repositioned the product to go upstream into clone selection and that's gaining a ton of traction. Downstream in QA/QC, the work that we started about two years ago with several large pharma players who have significant monoclonal antibody pipelines, we're seeing them gain -- seeing the product gain traction in QA/QC and that bodes well for the future. Second, MAX peak columns and Acuity Premier as a technology was custom designed for biologics that have affinity to metal surfaces. And that product -- that set of products has gained a ton of traction. And most recently, the Xevo TQ Absolute. I mean it has terrific performance as hardware and lower environmental footprint. So all of that combined, meaning operational excellence, new products, a leader who's really sort of embraced collaboration and embraced the operational excellence is really what's behind the U.S. doing as well as it does. And that, of course, has an impact on the gross margin as well. Puneet, I'll repeat what I've said also in the last quarter. I mean we've basically said, look, in the short-term, you should expect us to grow 5% to 7%, about a 1% impact of our five initiatives. And in the midterm 2024 onwards, you should see Waters going to the sort of range where you should start to see an impact of these new initiatives, right? And is it a bit sooner? Is it a bit later? I mean, I can't be more precise. All I can tell you is there's a ton of traction and just staying with the bioseparations area, just staying with the BioAccord in particular, there's a ton of traction for what we're doing with Sartorius, for clone selection. The BioAccord, just as it was initially designed has sort two very large applications. The first is on spent medium where we can analyze close to 200 analytes. So our customers in that category are interested in a simple instrument but they don't want to give up any of the sophistication. They don't want to look at five compounds and 15 compounds. They still want to look at 200 compounds because they are still trying to ascertain at that point which of these -- what race quantities of materials are going to impact their cell culture. So BioAccord is simple to use but a highly sophisticated instrument. And I think that's really important to keep in mind when you think about spend media. And then, the other application is on peptide mapping and the drug substance itself, the whole drug substance. And there, again, the applications are very wide. And here, where Waters has an advantage is with our ability to develop simple workflows, right? So our customers, again, are not willing to give up the sophistication. They want to know each amino acid in the sequence of the peptide, they want to know the confirmation. They want to know the size of the molecule. They don't want to give up any information. They want the instrument to be simple to use, the workflow to be simple to use and we're developing a whole bunch of workflows on that front. And again, feel extremely good about it. As I said, mid -- you should -- in the midterm, you should expect 100 basis points of sort of growth impact based on all the sort of adjacencies that I've talked about in the past. I can't be no precise on that but I can tell you there's a lot of excitement amongst our team and the customers in applications of bioseparations as well as bioprocessing. It's a great question and thanks for asking a more sort of qualitative question. Look, I mean, it's a question of collaboration, right? I mean Waters is known for its technical excellence and closeness to customers. But I think by bringing the commercial team closer to our development colleagues, we're now as we think through our launch process and Jon Pratt will talk to you a bit more about it in our Investor Day in a few weeks. As we brought these two teams together, we're able to bring the commercial input much sooner into development, number one. Number two, there's a lot more ownership from our commercial teams, not just the understanding but also a lot more ownership from our commercial teams as we launch the new products. And without a doubt, that has a lot to do with the traction we've seen with the MAX peak premier columns. The sales team are super excited the Acuity Premier, the Arc HPLC which was a demand or a request from our customers through our sales team and the R&D teams responded to it. And now as they are closer together, they sit in operational reviews together. I chair and Innovation Board where we have both commercial as well as R&D input. And I can tell you that has a significant amount to do with how we are seeing new products pick up in the market and the feedback, right? So I mean, in this space, you don't expect to hit a home run in the first day that you go out to bat, right? So you basically have to get feedback from our from the customers and those -- that feedback goes back into R&D seamlessly, right? And the best example of that is our software launch, right? We launched our [indiscernible] one application for -- with Waters Connect, basically a compliant compliant-ready software. And some of the customers wanted enterprise capabilities with that software. So our development team got that feedback very early on and has developed the solution. Same is true with BioAccord. Early on, we went head first into QA/QC that was a few years ago. Now with closer collaboration between commercial and R&D sitting at the same table as the customers come back and say, \"Hey, I want a simpler workflow for oligos because that's my pipeline or I want a simpler workflow for spend media. That's what the R&D team focuses on optimizing. So it's -- I could go on and on. I mean, it's incredibly exciting. And as a former researcher myself, I find the discussions very pragmatic, hugely collaborative and a learning experience for both parties, both commercial as well as R&D. So academic and government did especially well both in the U.S. and in China. And I would separate the two things, right? I mean again, I mean, we are -- while we have performed in line with many of the peers we've already reported with academic and government, I don't want you to assume that our turnaround in academic and government is finished, right? We have just begun remapping the KOLs, we started to work much harder on the e-procurement e-commerce availability for academic institutions. So there's a lot more to go. But the U.S. and China did super well in the first quarter. And the U.S., in particular, had a lot of traction, again by putting more feet on the street by talking to customers more directly. China benefited from the VAT -- the VAT expense or the VAT regulation being relieved a little bit step by step, right, so the customers are purchasing from what they had in the past. I would not assume that we've already turned the corner there, right? While we have good results this quarter, we are still working on it. And so I expect more from that segment. Yes. So Jack, great question. I mean the instrument growth will continue to drive recurring revenue growth, both chemistry and service. At this point, our guidance sort of assumes service and chemistry would be around high single digits, low double digits for the second half of the year. But again, I mean, this thing is not just here and now, right? These instruments will continue to produce revenue for the next seven, eight years. And the way we are performing on instrument replacement, we also think our instruments are recurring revenue because we've now built muscle strength and systems and processes so that the entire organization looks at instruments as a requiring revenue. And plus e-commerce is accretive and CDMOs are high volume. So they are all adding up to recurring revenue. Yes. And Dan, it's an excellent question. Look, as Amol summarize, it's a deeper understanding of the supply chain, not just ours but also the chips and who else is getting them [indiscernible] in a lot of discussions across Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, many top-to-top conversations and then finally, collaboration and creative problem solving. I mean that's what's gotten us this far. And our teams are continuing to do it, the fights far from over, right? I mean we see it still out there. But I think if there is an algorithm, again, as I said earlier, knock on wood, as I said, we seem to have something in our hands and our teams are dedicated to solving these problems. Let me now thank you for your participation. And on behalf of Waters' management team, I'd like to thank you for your continued support and your interest. I would also like to make you aware that we are hosting our 2022 Investor Day in just over two weeks on May 19 in New York City at the New York Stock Exchange, starting at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The main presentation from the event at 10 a.m. will be broadcast -- will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website. If you would like to join us in person for the event, please reach out to our IR team via the contact details on Slide 13. Thank you very much and have a wonderful day."

            "content": "Thank you, Udit and good morning, everyone. As Udit outlined, we recorded net sales of $691 million in the first quarter, an increase of 16% in constant currency and an increase of 13% as reported. Looking more closely at our top line results for the quarter on Slide 9, in constant currency, first by operating segment. Waters Division grew 16%, while TA grew by 18%. By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 19%. Industrial grew 17% and academic and government grew 4%. In Pharma, we saw broad-based strength across segments, geographies and applications and in both large molecule and small molecule. Growth was led by the U.S. which was up over 35%. India, up just under 30%; and China which grew mid-teens. In Industrial, our performance was also strong across all major geographies, with U.S., Europe and China all growing 20% or above. Turning to academic and government. We saw a similar trend to last quarter with mid-single-digit growth as customer spending has become more active, led by China and the U.S. Now by geography, sales in Asia were up 14%, with China up 17%. The Americas grew 26% with the U.S. up 28%. And Europe grew 9%. In China, we saw broad performance across all our end markets which grew each up double digits. In the U.S., growth towards broad-based led by Pharma which was up almost 40%; and industrial which grew over 20%. Growth was very strong in both instrument sales which grew almost 60% and recurring revenues which grew in the mid-teens. In Europe, growth was led by Industrial which grew 20% and driven by strong growth in food and environmental. Sales of LC and MS instruments to pharma customers grew high teens as strong capital purchasing patterns continued on from last year. Udit already covered our growth by products and services, where instruments grew 26% for the quarter, chemistry grew 8% and service grew 9%, driven by our commercial execution and new product contribution. Finally, TA had another great quarter with sales up 18%, led by strong growth in thermal analysis, microcalorimetry and rheology. Demand for our TA products continue to be strong in all regions, with growth driven by advanced materials and chemicals, including batteries and sustainable polymers. Now, I would like to comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Gross margin for the quarter increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% and despite higher instrument mix, inflation pressures and stronger U.S. dollar. This was driven by volume leverage and pricing. Operating margin for the quarter increased by 170 basis points to 30.3%, driven by volume leverage on operating expenses. In the quarter, our effective operating tax rate was 14.8%. Our average share count came in at 61 million shares which is about 1.7 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter increased 22% to $2.80 in comparison to $2.29 last year. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share increased to $2.62 compared to $2.37 last year. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of this presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2022, free cash flow was about 25% of sales at $176 million after funding $28 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from free cash flow was $6 million relating to investment in our Taunton precision chemistry operations. In the first quarter, accounts receivable DSO came in at 81 days, down three days compared to first quarter of last year. Given higher sales volume and our proactive measures to secure supply, including building some electronic component safety stock, Inventory increased by approximately $54 million in comparison to the prior year. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out attractive, high market, high-growth adjusting opportunity. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 493,000 shares of our common stock for $160 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was $941 million with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.9%. Now as we look ahead for the remainder of the year, I would like to provide some updated context on our thoughts for 2022 which is on Slide 10. We've had a strong start to the year, driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution across our geographies. As we look ahead, we expect solid momentum to continue and that our near-term growth initiatives will continue to contribute to our performance. We also expect that we will be able to continue to address supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures and these challenges do not worsen over the remainder of the year. These dynamics support increasing the full year 2022 guidance to 7.5% to 9% constant currency sales growth, up from our initial guide in February of 5% to 7%. At current rates, a negative currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 3 percentage points, resulting in full year reported sales growth guidance of 4.5% to 6%. Gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 58.5% and operating margin is expected to be approximately 30.5%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $35 million and full year tax rate to be approximately 15.5%. Average diluted 2022 share count is expected to be approximately 60.6 million. Our share repurchase program will continue into 2022 and we'll provide quarterly updates as appropriate. Rolling all this together and on a non-GAAP basis, we are raising our full year 2022 earnings per fully diluted share guidance to the range of $11.90 to $12.10. This includes negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points or $0.45 at current rates. Looking at the second quarter of 2022, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 6% to 8%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 4 percentage points, resulting in second quarter reported sales growth guidance of 2% to 4%. Given the ongoing lockdowns in China, we anticipate a headwind of approximately 100 to 200 basis points to our growth for the second quarter, assuming lockdowns do not worsen which is factored in our second quarter guidance. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65. This includes a negative currency impact of approximately 5 percentage points or $0.13 at current rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. So thanks a lot, Vijay, for the question. So look, I mean, we are raising our full year guide by approximately 2% at constant currency. What is sort of dragging it down is how the U.S. dollar has moved between our last guide and this guide, right? So when we guided last in February, there was close to $25 million FX headwind on the full year revenue. Now it's at $85 million. So almost $60 million headwind coming in on top line. And likewise, on EPS, that is a $0.25 incremental headwind versus what we guided before because now the EPS headwind is at $0.45. So that's all factored into our guidance. Despite some of these challenging macroeconomic conditions, we are raising both our revenue guide and our EPS guide. What that does assume is 6% to 8% Q2 and sort of a 5% to 7% second half of the year. And again there, we are putting our guide prudently given the macroeconomic conditions and we continue to monitor that. Sure. Thanks, Josh. So look at it from two vantage points, right? So on a full year basis, we are raising our EPS guidance but that does include a $0.25 incremental headwind versus the guide that we provided in February. And so in a way, if you say, look, we beat consensus in Q1 by about $0.45, $0.25 of that is lost in year to go in sort in FX and the rest of it, we are increasing our guide on EPS, plus or minus a little bit of spending timing switching between Q1 to Q2. So it's largely consistent with how we are guiding full year revenue increase and most of the gap is largely driven by change in FX assumptions. And then, look, I mean, there to -- historically, we've seen recurring revenues slightly higher than mid-single digits in the best years of Waters. And we've now for few quarters running in double digits or low double digits, right? So even this quarter, if you account for the one day fewer than the previous year, recurring revenues would be almost 10%, right? So we feel extremely good about it. In particular, the new product contribution and what we're seeing from our service team, right? So the new product contribution being MAX Peak Premier and a very rich pipeline that is specifically targeted towards large molecules, I mean what -- - is the world leader in separations and we are really turning our attention to complex large molecules, collaborating with our customers. And on the service side, remember we talked about increased attachment rates. That is also -- that is continuing to contribute and our attachment rates for our service. Services are increasing. So it's not just the translation of instruments to consumables and service. It's also unique contributions of new products and interesting innovation on the service side. So really excited. I mean, as I said, couldn't be prouder of the team across the board, there's been great performance. It's a great question and a tough one, Dan. I mean, we try to build safety stock wherever we can find the inventory. The situation on electronic components hasn't improved any bit versus Q4 or Q1. It's a five day in, day out. So I mean part of that is in the $54 million or so that the inventory has gone up. But there are components where we have a production plan in Q2, likely for a demand plan in Q3 where we may be missing components still and we continue to try to solve these problems either with the suppliers or with the market or through innovative engineering. So -- if you were to assume everything is solid and in inventory, we are far from a that's a story with everybody. I mean what life science tools buys from electronic component suppliers is less than probably single-digit percentage of their annual production. So in a way, everybody is in the same Q behind cellular networks and vehicles, right? So the fight is on and we continue to navigate it day in and day out."

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar. And good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues. 2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products, and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions.  As 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong, above-average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we've demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth.  In 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt. This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year.  We launched new and innovative products in 2023, including our Alliance iS next generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo tQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that pair with Wyatt MALS instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with ZetaStar.  Finally, we were recognized as one of the world's most sustainable companies, achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top five ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators. We're very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023.  Today, as I share our fourth quarter and full-year results, I have three key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we are well positioned for future long-term growth.  Turning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62, driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65.  For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms. As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition.  I will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increase increased Versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush.  For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia excluding China all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a full-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high-single-digits.  A key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.  This brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our global capability center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge.  This resilience, focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full-year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.  Now, let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending, resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales.  I will now give some detail on how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation.  Our strong results in 2023 was supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending on new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance iS and MaxPeak Premier Columns, as well as several of our high res mass spec instruments such as Cycliq G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.  Turning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high growth markets, where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed.  For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we made organic investments, launched new products, and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20%, just a few years ago.  For diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single-digits to double digits in the past several years.  Finally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends where very strong growth has remained throughout the year. Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10 times 2019 revenue levels and our TA business is increasingly aligned with their cyclical faster growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company.  Now I will share some facts supporting the long term outlook for above average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown on average 6% in organic constant currency terms. For instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%.  As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations. Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain 100 basis point long term tailwind in incremental growth.  Let's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least two key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs, where Waters' instruments and columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the two leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030. The second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo tQ Absolute mass spec. We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.  Finally, Wyatt light scattering is a high growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges at formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows.  I will now cover our 2024 full-year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year, with slow budget releases for downstream instrumentation. We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior-year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide.  With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full-year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build leverage in our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion, while still reinvesting for growth. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3%, in the range of $11.75 to $12.05.  Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal : Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges.  In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high-single-digit growth comparison last year.  We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations.  Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales.  In organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 11%, industrial declined 4% and academic and government declined 9%. In pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, pharma sales declined 4% as instruments sales were impacted by a muted budget flush, in line with our expectations.  In industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high-teens prior-year comparison. China declined approximately 20% as weakness has broadened into non-pharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications, which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas.  In academic and government, our ex-China Business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth. However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter.  By geography, sales in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics.  By products and services, instruments declined 20%, recurring revenues grew mid-single-digits, with continued high-single-digit growth outside of China. There was one additional day in the quarter versus the prior year.  Looking now at our full-year results, by end market, pharma declined 5%, industrial was flat, and academic and government grew 10%. Excluding China, pharma and industrial grew low-single-digits and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps.  Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia, ex-China, grew high-single-digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%.  By products and services, instruments declined 10%, which was primarily driven by China. Excluding China, instruments declined low-single-digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high-single-digit four-year CAGR. Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high-single-digits outside of China, with robust growth throughout the year.  Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns, serving large molecule workflows, and adoption of ecommerce. For service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.  Now, I will comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment.  Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity, and proactive cost alignment, together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2%, an expansion of 170 basis points, and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points.  For the full year, our focus and effort resulted in gross margin of 59.6%, an expansion of 160 basis points, and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9%, an expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high growth adjacencies.  Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior-year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%. Our average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year.  Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3% and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.  Now turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation less capital expenditures and exclude special items. In the fourth quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities, and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations.  We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This trend allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation.  At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2 times. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition.  As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objective.  Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions. We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024.  While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full-year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first four and half months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%.  We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.  Now rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.  Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1.  Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%.  Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates.  Now, I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments.\nUdit Batra : Thank you, Amol. So, in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024.  Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources.  In 2023, we started working with the Science Based Targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate related disclosure with our TCFD related reporting.  Waters was recognized as one of the best companies to work for but by the US News and World Report, and we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index.  We're also proud that our governance has been recognized. Waters Board of Directors was named the 2024 Public Company Board of the Year by National Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter.  So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor : Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We're now ready to open the phone lines for questions. \nOperator: Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Udit, just on the annual guidance here, at the midpoint, I think it's about 50 basis points growth. What is the guide you're assuming zooming for price? And can you talk about end markets, pharma, government and academia, and industrial sort of assumptions? I know you gave the China assumption. China is expected to be down. But could you just parse out between China versus non-China for those end markets?\nUdit Batra: Look, a couple of high level comments, and then I'll go to the end markets and let Amol comment on the pricing question. The 2024 guidance in general assumes that the trends that we saw in 2023 continue in large part. So, you start off just looking at what happened in 2023. outside of China, all end markets and geographies grew low-single-digits or thereabouts. So all geographies were low-single-digits, and we assumed the same trend for the balance of the year. And all end markets are in the similar sort of zip code. And in China, we assume roughly sort of mid-teens to high-teens decline for 2024.  Now when you do the arithmetic, you basically look at the comps. The first half of the year will be slower than the second half, right? The first half of the year has significantly higher comps. When you look at the academic and government stimulus, especially in China, and then the second half of the year, that alleviates, so you'll start to see a bit of a growth.  So now to your question on the full year and the assumption for different end markets. For the full year, pharma, we are expecting to grow low-single-digits. And this is again on the back of what we saw in 2023. Industrial was flat in 2023 for the full year, expect to be there or thereabouts, low-single-digit growth. And A&G with a very strong year, roughly 10%, 12% for 2023. We expect it to be a low double-digit decline, basically in China declining quite significantly because of high comps, and the rest of the world, you sort of go back to the long term trends of low single-digit growth. So really, overall, expecting the same execution that we saw in 2023, basically really nice performance in markets outside of China with low single-digit growth in China, mid-teens decline. And by end market, sort of similar trends. Strength continuing in pharma due to our QA/QC focus.  Amol, on the pricing. \nAmol Chaubal: On pricing, when we started 2023, we started with an assumption of 200 basis points, 250 basis points. But as the year panned out, our team gathered strength quarter after quarter, and you see full year, we finished about 300 basis points on price side.  Now, long term, we've said we'll do about 100 basis points better than what we've historically done. And historically, we had done 50 to 75 basis points. So that's where our current assumption is starting, roughly around 200 basis points of pricing gains in 2024. But, again, the underlying trend is we're doing better than that. And where better to see it, right? It reflects loud and clear in our gross margin expansion, which is where it should show up. \nUdit Batra: I think just to sort of emphasize that point even more, what gives me sort of a lot of confidence is what we saw on our gross margin and our operating margin. In such an environment, we took proactive cost actions. Operating margin for the full year expanded by 70 basis points and gross margin by 160 basis points. You can talk a good game on pricing, but at the end, it has to show up in the P&L, and that's what we're really proud off.\nVijay Kumar: Amol, one for you. Operating margin expansion, that's really pretty impressive considering revenues are almost flat this year organically. Is that all being driven by gross margins. I think in the past, you noted FX could have an impact on gross margins. Maybe just talk about what's driving [indiscernible] and FX assumptions on margins.\nAmol Chaubal: We expanded our full year margins by 70 basis points. And on a constant currency basis, that's 120 basis points of expansion because we had a good 50 basis points of FX headwind during the year. The negative leverage from volume was partially offset by mix and AIP. So net-net, it was negative 40 basis points. Pricing added 110 basis points, freight and material savings another 60 basis points, cost actions added another 60 basis points. And then we invested about 70 basis points in nurturing higher growth adjacencies. So that's roughly the breakdown.\nUdit Batra: All hands on deck basically.\nOperator: My next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Sykes: Maybe just the first one, a higher level question. Udit, just on the replacement cycle impact, just given the outsized growth we saw in instruments during this sort of COVID period, what kind of impact do you think this has had on replacement cycles, particularly in biopharma, given a lot of the spend was concentrated there? Do you think the replacement cycle has been pushed out? Or do you think that you'll see that impact of that coming back in this year? Or is it more of a 2025 impact?\nUdit Batra: Let me start by first just talking about what we have seen in Q4. You would have seen that, Q4, our sales ramped from Q3 to Q4 by about 15%. And this is typical in a QA/QC driven business. It's muted versus historical trends, which are roughly 24% for Waters. But in a QA/QC driven business, you do see a ramp in replacement towards the end of the year. That trend is very much intact, especially outside of China.  I think it's naive to think that replacement cycles have suddenly stopped. This Q4 ramp tells us that replacement cycles are still ongoing. Now the underlying question is, what are driving these replacement cycles and how do you trigger them? In a muted CapEx environment, the conversations we've had with customers on replacements have largely centered around new products, Arc HPLC and Alliance iS, which have both gained a lot of nice receptivity. So, new products allow you to continue to have that conversation. And you see that reflected in our sort of pharma results outside of China and as you compare it to our peer group.  Now, to your question on did we see an outsize replacement during the post COVID years? It's very difficult to tell. We think it was more a push back from the depression that you saw during COVID and outsized execution that we saw due to the replacement cycle that we had not had from 2018 to 2020. So pent up demand sort of helped us get really outsized growth.  Now, to corroborate that point, if you just look at LC, LC is 70% replacement business. And if you look at how we ended the full year 2023, so LC \u2013 and again, one should look at long term trends, on a long term basis, is roughly 1% growth on a four-year CAGR. So LC is growing roughly 1% on a four year CAGR basis, which is well below the long term average of about 4% to 5%. And you add pricing, so it's actually 4-ish-percent sort of below in volume versus the long term trend of 4% to 5% LC growth.  So we do expect LC replacement to start imminently. Now don't ask me exactly when that inflection point is. Short term, we have a ton of visibility with a lot of data and a lot of conversations with customers. Long term, we think the trends are going to revert back to the mean or even better, given what we've talked about in our prepared remarks. The inflection point you don't get any extra marks to call it. So in 2024, we've assumed the same trends as 2023 to persist. But, definitely, we believe LC is due to come up in growth rates. So, long answer, but I hope that gives you a lot of context on how we're thinking about it.\nMatthew Sykes: A quick one on PFAS. You mentioned that slide deck that the market is starting to expand into foods probably earlier than we had expected. Just given the potential size of the market, food relative to water, one, how big do you assume the food market to be over the long term? And two, how much of that 30 basis points annual contribution from PFAS actually comes from food relative to water in your assumptions? \nUdit Batra: Early days, Matt. We've assumed roughly $50 million to $75 million for now in the food market. And over time, we expect it to expand. As you well pointed out, that could be a pretty significant market. We want to be a bit cautious here. So the 30 basis points is largely on the back of water testing, and not much from food testing at this point. But that said, the PFAS market is super dynamic. So we've gone from water testing to expansion into food testing, into tissue samples, into soil samples, into sewage, and into industrial companies sort of purchasing mass specs to analyze their effluent stream. So, it's a market that's going to significantly expand. But we're a bit cautious in trying to guess exactly what that size is. What we're focused on is sort of going after each and every opportunity in these segments, and you see that with roughly 40% growth. So stay tuned. As we find out more, you'll progressively see the increased market sizes or better information emerge.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: I just wanted to dig into this 1Q guide a little bit. This was weaker than most of us had anticipated. Appreciate the market is pretty dynamic and you had some really difficult comps in China during 1Q. But are there any other one-timers in terms of why you'd have that level of sequential step down? And was there any pull-forward that may have helped 4Q that led to that softer 1Q guide as well?\nAmol Chaubal: The one-timers are largely in China. You had the stimulus last year in A&G. And the level of weakness we are seeing now in China, last year's Q1 baseline doesn't reflect that at all. In the rest of the world, we are assuming customers will be slow out of the gate versus what we typically see. And that's based on the trend that we saw in Q4, where the budget flush was muted. And that will somehow, we think, reflect in how quickly budgets are released to customers. And that's sort of playing out in the guide.\nUdit Batra: Rachel, just to sort of build on what Amol has said, we're really no different than what we saw in Q4 overall, right? Q4 was almost 7.5%, 8% down versus previous year. And we're assuming, at the midpoint of the guide, Q1 is roughly 10% down. We expect, as Amol said, the trends from Q4 to persist into Q1. Low-single-digit-ish growth or flat growth in ex China. And in China, roughly 40% decline due to the heavy comps, especially from A&G last year where we had the benefit of the stimulus was coming through. So no real challenge.  I'll just sort of say one more thing. In pharma in China, in particular, we're starting to see a bit of stabilization. We're starting to see biotech spending start to reemerge. We're starting to see CDMO spending on recurring revenues. And we're also, in the branded generics segment, which is roughly 50% of our pharma market, where more and more cities and more and more hospitals are starting to open up. So we see that trend, but we are cautious in calling that at this point in Q1. So Q1, basically similar tends to Q4. \nAmol Chaubal: Just keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter, right? So small changes have a meaningful impact on the pattern.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Just my follow-up on this assumed gradual improvement that you guys are embedding throughout the year, can you just dig a little bit more into those assumptions? Which markets and which geographies are you assuming more of an improvement than others? You talked about some of the China in the comping. So, how much do comps really have to do with that improvement that you're expecting throughout the year as well?\nAmol Chaubal: We've sort of looked at it from various different vantage points. If you look at sort of how we've performed ex China, we've grown sort of low single-digits and we expect that to be the case for the full year, with some slow out of the gate with how the budgets are released in Q1. And then, you sort of face a muted budget flush baseline towards the later part of the year.  China, you will see decline, as we talked about, in Q1 because the baseline is pretty strong. But as we get into the second half of China, we think things will normalize because a lot of the demand slowness is reflected. So if you sort of look at it from that vantage point, for the first half, we sort of declined mid-single-digits. For the second half, we sort of grow mid-single-digits. When you look at it on a five year stack versus 2019, roughly, it's mid-single-digits growth both for the first half as well as the second half.\nUdit Batra: Similar trends in the first half and second half. Just the arithmetic is that the comps in the first half are higher than the second half.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: Actually, I want to look at China a different way. And I'm just doing some quick math on the fly, which is always dangerous. But one thing as I look back the last few years I've noticed is I think Q1 revenue in China is typically about 70% of Q4 revenue in China, just kind of thinking about the historical sequential pattern, to the extent you can do that, over the last few years, given how different that has been. But if we use that as precedent, it seems like you're essentially embedding that pattern into your guidance this year again. So when I keep that in mind and I look at Q3 and Q4 revenue in China, which were about $100 million each, well, the comps are really tough and the growth is not going to look great in the first half of the year. Are you at some level kind of assuming a normalization of sequential growth over the course of 2024 relative to Q4 on a sequential basis? \nUdit Batra: It's a great question. You nailed it. When we gave our Q4 guidance also last year, there was a lot of questions on how did you come up with the guidance, and we use similar sort of math. You basically look at 15 years of data, which is what we have. And you look at sequential changes mathematically. Then you look at the funnel itself and then look at what the funnel is saying in terms of the orders. And third, you have conversations with customers. And during a difficult time, the visibility \u2013 ironically, people say visibility is pretty low. Well, visibility in the short term is incredibly high. We just didn't like what we're seeing. And so, people think visibility is low. Visibility is pretty high. Analytically, we're looking at things very carefully. We're talking to a ton of customers. We're just executing really, really well. Just getting every opportunity that's in front of us.  So to answer your question, yes, we are using that math of sequential growth quarter-on-quarter, and that's embedded in the full-year guidance. Now, if that improves \u2013 I mean, I'm sort of anticipating the next question. If that improves, of course, you'll see upside right? And we're starting to see trends from Q4, especially in China, look a bit better in Q1, especially in the largest end market, which is pharma.  In the ex-China geographies, in Q1, we've assumed that the same trends continue from Q4 and customers are cautious, like they were cautious in Q1, which is what we are sort of hearing from many of our customers. They want to see how Q1 lands before they start releasing CapEx. But you've got one of the elements of our guide philosophy nailed, yes.\nDoug Schenkel: Udit, either for you, or for Amol, I was wondering if you'd be willing to delineate between large and small molecule growth on the chemistry side? I'm just curious how that's been trending. And what's incorporated into guidance that may be cutting things in an unfair way? But if you're willing to indulge us, I think that would be really interesting just to hear how that's been trending and how you're thinking about it for 2024. \nUdit Batra: I think let's look at clean results ex-China, which is where things are not sort of affected by shutdowns and the like. I can give you the overall statistic. Back in 2020, the revenues from biologics, out of our total pharma revenues, were less than 20%. Now that number is in excess of 35%. 400 basis points of that is Wyatt. But the rest of it is the base organic acceleration in large molecule applications.  Now, I can't tell you off the top of my head, how much of that comes from chemistry and how much of that comes from instruments. It's a mix, I would argue. At this point, it's basically a mix of the two, BioAccord sort of picking up, Xevo G3 picking up. But in chemistry, what I can tell you is roughly 70% to 80% of R&D spend is now on large molecule and biologics application MaxPeak Premier Columns, in its third year, is growing in excess of 30%. We've introduced a new gene therapy column. So, really pleased with what we're doing on large molecule applications, with 35% of our pharma revenues now coming from biologics.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. \nTom Stevens: This is Tom Stevens on for Dan Brennan today. I guess my first one is just on the industrials guide. And given the strength of the category with PFAS testing and battery testing and the like, what kind of gives you confidence that momentum kind of continues in the back half and why we shouldn't see maybe a rest of world cyclical slowdown? That's my first one and I've got a couple of others to follow up.\nUdit Batra: Industrial finished 2023 roughly flat. And flat in a year where there was significant macro challenges. And this was largely due to PFAS and battery testing offsetting the other macro sensitive segments in our industrial business. And TA, we've not talked about that business in a while, but the TA business for the full year grew 3% in a year where growth was very difficult to get and that included \u2013 that number includes China.  Now, as you look into 2024, we assume that the full year will be there or thereabouts, low single-digit growth. Ex-China growing low single-digits really on the back of PFAS, battery and a bit of recovery on food and environmental. And China, really now, given this large comps in 2023 in the negative territory in the low to mid-single-digits. So expecting 2024 to look similar to 2023 overall, especially ex-China. A little bit of \u2013 the stronger sort of comps in China make maybe a bit of muted growth. So you should assume that industrial will be sort of flat to low single-digit growth in 2024.\nDoug Schenkel: Just to pivot to LCs and that kind of long term trajectory, could you remind us what the net contribution of China was in the prior four years on a trend basis and then maybe how you think that long term market trajectory is different, with a potentially muted China going forward and/or you're kind of mixed into kind of larger molecule applications?\nAmol Chaubal: China, if you look at 2019 or 2022, was roughly 17% to 19% of our revenue. Now, where we finished in 2023, it's about 15% of our revenue.  When you look at sort of the different issues compounding the current situation in China, but we generally feel, barring maybe one or two smaller issues, most of these issues are cyclical rather than structural. So, for example, CDMOs struggling with overcapacity, as well as geopolitical challenges or branded generics pulling back spend because of anti-corruption campaigns or industrial business, especially food and environmental, slowing down because of government pulling back reimbursement. We think these issues are largely cyclical. They will all come back. It's just a question when, and it's very hard to predict when that will happen.  On the other hand, the biotech funding and the resultant volume they've placed on tier two, tier three CDMOs, that we think is structural. And in the near term, they're not going to be at the levels of 2021, 2022 spending. But at least on that issue, which is structural, the good news is we think we found the bottom on that issue because newer molecules are starting to see funding. But there is going to be sort of $30 million to $40 million correction to our 2022 baseline. The remaining issues we think eventually will come back. And that's the business that is today.  And then, as we've said before, what we are super excited about is this whole push for innovative medicines. And there's a whole new vector opening up in China and we think that will create significant value. And we absolutely want to be part of that equation. And we are taking steps, so that we have local presence and participate in that journey more closely.\nUdit Batra: Just to sort of embellish on that, Amol has covered it extremely well, Tom. LC, as I mentioned earlier \u2013 two or three factors to keep in mind \u2013 on a long term basis, is traversing well below our long-term averages. So, in general, on a four or five-year stack basis, you should expect LC to be mid-single-digits. It's actually flat to 1%. You look at that number for 2023, LC overall declined almost 10%, 11%. And bulk of that decline came from China. So, China declined roughly 30%, 40% \u2013 maybe actually close to 40%, 45% in LC. Outside of China, we were sort of low single-digit decliners in LC.  So to your question on how will the recovery will be impacted with coming back to growth in China, we expect that, in the first half of the year, we'll see similar trends that we saw in the second half of the year in LC. And the second half of the year, we will start to see a bit of a relief and growth.  And as we talk to our customers, to our largest customer segment, which is pharma, we're starting to see biotechs start to spend again, we're starting to see CDMOs, especially recurring revenue, come back. And in branded generics, more and more hospitals are opening up. So it's going to be a mix of replacement cycles beginning again in ex-China markets and in China recovery in pharma.  So put those two together, and you should start to see LC come back. We're not assuming that in our guide at this point, but definitely there are trends in that direction. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Ramsey Schulte: Maybe first, just touching on some of your commercial initiatives. Any comments on what you're targeting for service attachment rates or ecommerce improvements in 2024?\nUdit Batra: Really continuing the trend. So we went from, what, 20 \u2013 so, ecommerce from about 20% to 35% already, 35-plus-percent already in ecommerce, and we expect that to grow closer to 40% by the end of 2024. And in service attachment, having already seen roughly 500 basis points of service attach increase from the time we started the initiative three years ago, we're planning for another 100 basis points of service attachment increase in 2024. So continuing on with our commercial initiatives.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: I've got a couple. Could you comment on order trends in Q4? If I missed it, I apologize. Did you see orders pick up sequentially? And how should we think about the tax rate sort of in 2025 as we work through the Pillar Two stuff. And I have one more follow-up?\nUdit Batra: I'll start with the order and then I'll let Amol talk about the tax piece. Orders are in line with sales again, direct. So, no real difference between the two for Q4. And the trend from Q3 to Q4, it's almost a 15% ramp from Q3 to Q4. Same thing we saw with orders really, as expected. So, Q4 really landed as we had talked about. Amol, on tax.\nAmol Chaubal: Derik, great question on tax. So, if you traced last few years with us, the tax rate has gone up roughly about 150 basis points to 200 basis points. And bulk of that is really coming from the US R&D capitalization. And as a company, we've sort of taken a position that Section 174 changes have an ongoing effect on our P&L. And absent of future legislation, we are not excluding those charges from our non-GAAP P&L, which is different from some of us in the sector. But we think those expenses are part of our non-GAAP P&L, and that's the bulk of the change.  The other things that are creeping in there is Singapore going from 0% to 5%. and Ireland adopting Pillar Two, going to 15%. I think 2025, the. big one is, will Singapore adopt and in what form and in what offsets they provide when they do adopt that. So that remains to be seen. We are closely watching that. And as that plays out, we will provide more commentary when that happens.\nDerik De Bruin: One final one, if I may. Wyatt was a great deal. Nice fit in. Your leverage is down. I would expect you to potentially restart the buyback program. Could you just sort of talk about what other technologies you could potentially be thinking about in terms of how to augment. I'm just sort of curious in terms of what your capital appointment outlay is.\nUdit Batra: Derik, fantastic question. our goal in bioanalytical characterization is to make it as simple as it is in small molecules. The QA/QC environment for large molecules in cell and gene therapy should become just as simple. And to do that, you need to take some high end technologies, simplify them, move them into downstream applications, so they're simple to use. LC is already there. Mass spec, the BioAccord has made great strides. Light scattering is ahead of mass spec. So it's going to enter QA/QC sooner. And there are a couple of other technologies, like Raman, like cellular analysis, that also belong in the QA/QC and the process analytical testing domain.  But all of this hinges on having a simple software that the regulators trust, like in power. So, our single largest initiative with Wyatt after delivering our commercial results is to get Wyatt light scattering software onto Empower. And we will have a beta version of that by the end of the year. And I think that's the primary requirement for QA/QC in large molecules to become like small.  So stay tuned, really exciting area. And we're investing in the future while we are navigating the present really, really carefully.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you very much. That concludes our Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Udit to deliver our closing remarks. \nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar. Thank you, Amol. Thank you, everyone, for listening. 2023 has been an unprecedented and challenging year. We've navigated extremely well. As you look at our results outside of China, every end market, every geography grew, which is unusual in this environment amongst our peer group as well. And what is even more pleasing is our focus on cost management. So, really, 70 basis points of margin expansion in the year where the top line went down dramatically is quite an achievement. And we've done that while setting ourselves up very well for the future. We expect the long term growth of our business to be very much intact and accelerate based on what Amol and I described to you.  So thank you, again, for your interest and your attention. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar. And good morning, everyone. I would like to begin today's call by expressing my gratitude to all my colleagues. 2023 was another transformative year for Waters. Throughout the year, our teams kept an unwavering focus on customers, launched innovative new products, and delivered strong business performance, all during highly eventful times with dynamic market conditions.  As 2022 ended, the results of our transformation clearly showed on the top line, having delivered several years of very strong, above-average sales growth. Since then, in 2023, we've demonstrated our ability to manage exceptionally well through a downturn while continuing to make investments for growth.  In 2023, we also initiated the next phase of our transformation with the acquisition of Wyatt. This brings with it a new vector for value creation to our shareholders through M&A and we're off to a great start. As an added benefit, it has accelerated our journey into high growth adjacent markets, where we made continued progress with our organic investments over the course of the year.  We launched new and innovative products in 2023, including our Alliance iS next generation LC platform. We expanded our Xevo tQ mass spec into clinical applications and developed size exclusion columns for viral vectors that pair with Wyatt MALS instruments. We even had our first light scattering launch as a combined company with ZetaStar.  Finally, we were recognized as one of the world's most sustainable companies, achieving a variety of ESG awards. This includes our top five ranking on Barron's Most Sustainable Companies list which scores over 1,000 publicly traded companies based on 230 ESG performance indicators. We're very proud of what we've achieved at Waters in 2023.  Today, as I share our fourth quarter and full-year results, I have three key messages. First, we've continued to execute well. Second, our transformation is contributing to our results. And third, we are well positioned for future long-term growth.  Turning now to our results. In the fourth quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which was in line with our expectations. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share landed at the high end of our guidance at $3.62, driven by strong margin performance. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $3.65.  For the full year, sales declined 0.5% as reported and 2% in organic constant currency. Even with a constrained CapEx environment, all our regions outside of China grew in 2023 in organic constant currency terms. As expected, Wyatt successfully delivered on on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to sales. And with a strong EPS result in Q4, non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in at $11.75, which reflects underlying growth of approximately 2% before FX headwinds of 3% and 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition.  I will now describe our sales results in more detail. The spending environment for instruments remained challenging into year-end. However, Q4 revenue increase increased Versus Q3 levels in all our geographies, even China as we continue to execute well in tough macro conditions. Reported sales were $108 million higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. This reflects a 15% ramp that was consistent with our guidance for a muted year-end budget flush.  For the full year, our organic constant currency sales grew 3% year-over-year, excluding China. As I mentioned earlier, the Americas, Europe and Asia excluding China all grew in 2023. This took a lot of effort from our sales team who did a fantastic job capitalizing on the available opportunities in the market with our competitive portfolio. As a result, on a full-year stack basis, our ex-China growth remains at a healthy high-single-digits.  A key challenge in 2023 was the abrupt turn we saw in China where conditions deteriorated as the year progressed. This was particularly the case in the pharma market where our revenues are most heavily weighted. For the full year, China sales declined more than 20% overall, which was a 5% headwind to our total growth.  This brings us now to our margin performance. We believe that the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management when things slow down. During 2023, we saw volume and FX headwinds, while inflationary pressure continued. We responded with stronger pricing and added further discipline to our operational objectives. We redoubled our productivity efforts, including the opening of our global capability center in Bangalore, India. And we undertook proactive cost alignment as the slowdown began to emerge.  This resilience, focus and commitment allowed us to deliver excellent operational results in our P&L. Our full-year gross margin was 59.6%, which is 160 basis points better than the previous year. Our full-year adjusted operating margin was 30.9%, which is 70 basis points of expansion.  Now, let me share our progress with the acquisition of Wyatt Technology. The strong start to lead sharing between Wyatt and Waters allowed us to offset a slowdown in biotech spending, resulting in an on-target M&A contribution of 2.5% to our full year sales.  I will now give some detail on how our revitalized portfolio and alignment with higher growth segments are contributing to growth as part of our transformation.  Our strong results in 2023 was supported by our innovative portfolio, which helped drive customer spending on new products are gaining good traction in the market, including TQ Absolute, Alliance iS and MaxPeak Premier Columns, as well as several of our high res mass spec instruments such as Cycliq G3 and MRT. From an adoption perspective, this puts us in an excellent position when instrument budgets begin to normalize.  Turning now to our adjacencies. We have continued to invest and expand into adjacent high growth markets, where our business model of solving problems in downstream regulated applications can be deployed.  For bioseparations and bioanalytical characterizations, we made organic investments, launched new products, and deployed capital to M&A. Large molecule applications are now 35% of our pharma revenues and expected to trend higher, up from around 20%, just a few years ago.  For diagnostics, we have invested in our clinical business and added workflows for specialty applications of mass spec. This has transformed related revenue growth from that of low to mid-single-digits to double digits in the past several years.  Finally, our focus on batteries is paying dividends where very strong growth has remained throughout the year. Revenues from battery applications are now at over 10 times 2019 revenue levels and our TA business is increasingly aligned with their cyclical faster growing applications. Each of these exciting growth areas is delivering incremental revenue to the company.  Now I will share some facts supporting the long term outlook for above average growth and provide our 2024 guidance. Since 2010, Waters has grown on average 6% in organic constant currency terms. For instruments, while the standard deviation is high, long term average growth has been 5%. For recurring revenues, the standard deviation is much lower and the average growth is 7%.  As we look ahead, several vectors make us confident that this growth could be even higher. The first is even faster volume growth in segments that we serve, driven by global prescription drug sales and environmental regulations. Second is increased use of analytical instruments for characterizing large molecules and novel modalities. And third, it's about historic pricing where we expect to sustain 100 basis point long term tailwind in incremental growth.  Let's take each of these growth vectors in turn. There are at least two key drivers of testing volume acceleration. The first is related to the adoption of GLP-1 drugs, where Waters' instruments and columns are specified into in-process testing and QA/QC testing at the two leading manufacturers. We expect our position to contribute an average additional revenue growth of 30 basis points per year between now and 2030. The second is PFAS testing where we've been gaining share in a rapidly expanding market, in part driven by the sensitivity and compact size of our Xevo tQ Absolute mass spec. We expect PFAS testing to contribute an additional 30 basis points to our revenue growth for the foreseeable future.  Finally, Wyatt light scattering is a high growth business, serving attractive large molecule applications. We expect it to contribute 40 basis points of core growth accretion to our business on an annualized basis. It also accelerates our ability to solve customer challenges at formulation development, bioanalytical characterization and QA/QC testing, which has positive repercussions for our Waters business as we increasingly tie our columns, LC and mass spec into these workflows.  I will now cover our 2024 full-year guidance. We expect customer spending caution to continue in the first quarter of the year, with slow budget releases for downstream instrumentation. We then expect to see a gradual improvement for the remainder of the year as budgets open up, market conditions improve and as prior-year comparisons become easier. We expect weakness in China to continue, particularly in the first half of the year, which also plays into the growth phasing of our guide.  With this initial outlook for 2024, we expect full-year organic constant currency sales growth to be between negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. We expect continued strong operational performance to build leverage in our P&L with 20 to 30 basis points of further operating margin expansion, while still reinvesting for growth. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 0% to 3%, in the range of $11.75 to $12.05.  Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our fourth quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance for 2024. Amol? Thank you, Amol. So, in summary, another transformative year for Waters. We will continue to navigate the current market environment well and deliver earnings growth for our shareholders in 2024.  Before I close, I would like to share a few updates on our ESG efforts. We've made strong progress towards our environmental goals with 77% of our electricity now sourced from renewable or low carbon sources.  In 2023, we started working with the Science Based Targets initiative to build on this progress and develop further emissions reduction targets. We've also enhanced our climate related disclosure with our TCFD related reporting.  Waters was recognized as one of the best companies to work for but by the US News and World Report, and we achieved a perfect score of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index.  We're also proud that our governance has been recognized. Waters Board of Directors was named the 2024 Public Company Board of the Year by National Association of Corporate Directors, New England chapter.  So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. Look, a couple of high level comments, and then I'll go to the end markets and let Amol comment on the pricing question. The 2024 guidance in general assumes that the trends that we saw in 2023 continue in large part. So, you start off just looking at what happened in 2023. outside of China, all end markets and geographies grew low-single-digits or thereabouts. So all geographies were low-single-digits, and we assumed the same trend for the balance of the year. And all end markets are in the similar sort of zip code. And in China, we assume roughly sort of mid-teens to high-teens decline for 2024.  Now when you do the arithmetic, you basically look at the comps. The first half of the year will be slower than the second half, right? The first half of the year has significantly higher comps. When you look at the academic and government stimulus, especially in China, and then the second half of the year, that alleviates, so you'll start to see a bit of a growth.  So now to your question on the full year and the assumption for different end markets. For the full year, pharma, we are expecting to grow low-single-digits. And this is again on the back of what we saw in 2023. Industrial was flat in 2023 for the full year, expect to be there or thereabouts, low-single-digit growth. And A&G with a very strong year, roughly 10%, 12% for 2023. We expect it to be a low double-digit decline, basically in China declining quite significantly because of high comps, and the rest of the world, you sort of go back to the long term trends of low single-digit growth. So really, overall, expecting the same execution that we saw in 2023, basically really nice performance in markets outside of China with low single-digit growth in China, mid-teens decline. And by end market, sort of similar trends. Strength continuing in pharma due to our QA/QC focus.  Amol, on the pricing. I think just to sort of emphasize that point even more, what gives me sort of a lot of confidence is what we saw on our gross margin and our operating margin. In such an environment, we took proactive cost actions. Operating margin for the full year expanded by 70 basis points and gross margin by 160 basis points. You can talk a good game on pricing, but at the end, it has to show up in the P&L, and that's what we're really proud off. All hands on deck basically. Let me start by first just talking about what we have seen in Q4. You would have seen that, Q4, our sales ramped from Q3 to Q4 by about 15%. And this is typical in a QA/QC driven business. It's muted versus historical trends, which are roughly 24% for Waters. But in a QA/QC driven business, you do see a ramp in replacement towards the end of the year. That trend is very much intact, especially outside of China.  I think it's naive to think that replacement cycles have suddenly stopped. This Q4 ramp tells us that replacement cycles are still ongoing. Now the underlying question is, what are driving these replacement cycles and how do you trigger them? In a muted CapEx environment, the conversations we've had with customers on replacements have largely centered around new products, Arc HPLC and Alliance iS, which have both gained a lot of nice receptivity. So, new products allow you to continue to have that conversation. And you see that reflected in our sort of pharma results outside of China and as you compare it to our peer group.  Now, to your question on did we see an outsize replacement during the post COVID years? It's very difficult to tell. We think it was more a push back from the depression that you saw during COVID and outsized execution that we saw due to the replacement cycle that we had not had from 2018 to 2020. So pent up demand sort of helped us get really outsized growth.  Now, to corroborate that point, if you just look at LC, LC is 70% replacement business. And if you look at how we ended the full year 2023, so LC \u2013 and again, one should look at long term trends, on a long term basis, is roughly 1% growth on a four-year CAGR. So LC is growing roughly 1% on a four year CAGR basis, which is well below the long term average of about 4% to 5%. And you add pricing, so it's actually 4-ish-percent sort of below in volume versus the long term trend of 4% to 5% LC growth.  So we do expect LC replacement to start imminently. Now don't ask me exactly when that inflection point is. Short term, we have a ton of visibility with a lot of data and a lot of conversations with customers. Long term, we think the trends are going to revert back to the mean or even better, given what we've talked about in our prepared remarks. The inflection point you don't get any extra marks to call it. So in 2024, we've assumed the same trends as 2023 to persist. But, definitely, we believe LC is due to come up in growth rates. So, long answer, but I hope that gives you a lot of context on how we're thinking about it. Early days, Matt. We've assumed roughly $50 million to $75 million for now in the food market. And over time, we expect it to expand. As you well pointed out, that could be a pretty significant market. We want to be a bit cautious here. So the 30 basis points is largely on the back of water testing, and not much from food testing at this point. But that said, the PFAS market is super dynamic. So we've gone from water testing to expansion into food testing, into tissue samples, into soil samples, into sewage, and into industrial companies sort of purchasing mass specs to analyze their effluent stream. So, it's a market that's going to significantly expand. But we're a bit cautious in trying to guess exactly what that size is. What we're focused on is sort of going after each and every opportunity in these segments, and you see that with roughly 40% growth. So stay tuned. As we find out more, you'll progressively see the increased market sizes or better information emerge. Rachel, just to sort of build on what Amol has said, we're really no different than what we saw in Q4 overall, right? Q4 was almost 7.5%, 8% down versus previous year. And we're assuming, at the midpoint of the guide, Q1 is roughly 10% down. We expect, as Amol said, the trends from Q4 to persist into Q1. Low-single-digit-ish growth or flat growth in ex China. And in China, roughly 40% decline due to the heavy comps, especially from A&G last year where we had the benefit of the stimulus was coming through. So no real challenge.  I'll just sort of say one more thing. In pharma in China, in particular, we're starting to see a bit of stabilization. We're starting to see biotech spending start to reemerge. We're starting to see CDMO spending on recurring revenues. And we're also, in the branded generics segment, which is roughly 50% of our pharma market, where more and more cities and more and more hospitals are starting to open up. So we see that trend, but we are cautious in calling that at this point in Q1. So Q1, basically similar tends to Q4. Similar trends in the first half and second half. Just the arithmetic is that the comps in the first half are higher than the second half. It's a great question. You nailed it. When we gave our Q4 guidance also last year, there was a lot of questions on how did you come up with the guidance, and we use similar sort of math. You basically look at 15 years of data, which is what we have. And you look at sequential changes mathematically. Then you look at the funnel itself and then look at what the funnel is saying in terms of the orders. And third, you have conversations with customers. And during a difficult time, the visibility \u2013 ironically, people say visibility is pretty low. Well, visibility in the short term is incredibly high. We just didn't like what we're seeing. And so, people think visibility is low. Visibility is pretty high. Analytically, we're looking at things very carefully. We're talking to a ton of customers. We're just executing really, really well. Just getting every opportunity that's in front of us.  So to answer your question, yes, we are using that math of sequential growth quarter-on-quarter, and that's embedded in the full-year guidance. Now, if that improves \u2013 I mean, I'm sort of anticipating the next question. If that improves, of course, you'll see upside right? And we're starting to see trends from Q4, especially in China, look a bit better in Q1, especially in the largest end market, which is pharma.  In the ex-China geographies, in Q1, we've assumed that the same trends continue from Q4 and customers are cautious, like they were cautious in Q1, which is what we are sort of hearing from many of our customers. They want to see how Q1 lands before they start releasing CapEx. But you've got one of the elements of our guide philosophy nailed, yes. I think let's look at clean results ex-China, which is where things are not sort of affected by shutdowns and the like. I can give you the overall statistic. Back in 2020, the revenues from biologics, out of our total pharma revenues, were less than 20%. Now that number is in excess of 35%. 400 basis points of that is Wyatt. But the rest of it is the base organic acceleration in large molecule applications.  Now, I can't tell you off the top of my head, how much of that comes from chemistry and how much of that comes from instruments. It's a mix, I would argue. At this point, it's basically a mix of the two, BioAccord sort of picking up, Xevo G3 picking up. But in chemistry, what I can tell you is roughly 70% to 80% of R&D spend is now on large molecule and biologics application MaxPeak Premier Columns, in its third year, is growing in excess of 30%. We've introduced a new gene therapy column. So, really pleased with what we're doing on large molecule applications, with 35% of our pharma revenues now coming from biologics. Industrial finished 2023 roughly flat. And flat in a year where there was significant macro challenges. And this was largely due to PFAS and battery testing offsetting the other macro sensitive segments in our industrial business. And TA, we've not talked about that business in a while, but the TA business for the full year grew 3% in a year where growth was very difficult to get and that included \u2013 that number includes China.  Now, as you look into 2024, we assume that the full year will be there or thereabouts, low single-digit growth. Ex-China growing low single-digits really on the back of PFAS, battery and a bit of recovery on food and environmental. And China, really now, given this large comps in 2023 in the negative territory in the low to mid-single-digits. So expecting 2024 to look similar to 2023 overall, especially ex-China. A little bit of \u2013 the stronger sort of comps in China make maybe a bit of muted growth. So you should assume that industrial will be sort of flat to low single-digit growth in 2024. Just to sort of embellish on that, Amol has covered it extremely well, Tom. LC, as I mentioned earlier \u2013 two or three factors to keep in mind \u2013 on a long term basis, is traversing well below our long-term averages. So, in general, on a four or five-year stack basis, you should expect LC to be mid-single-digits. It's actually flat to 1%. You look at that number for 2023, LC overall declined almost 10%, 11%. And bulk of that decline came from China. So, China declined roughly 30%, 40% \u2013 maybe actually close to 40%, 45% in LC. Outside of China, we were sort of low single-digit decliners in LC.  So to your question on how will the recovery will be impacted with coming back to growth in China, we expect that, in the first half of the year, we'll see similar trends that we saw in the second half of the year in LC. And the second half of the year, we will start to see a bit of a relief and growth.  And as we talk to our customers, to our largest customer segment, which is pharma, we're starting to see biotechs start to spend again, we're starting to see CDMOs, especially recurring revenue, come back. And in branded generics, more and more hospitals are opening up. So it's going to be a mix of replacement cycles beginning again in ex-China markets and in China recovery in pharma.  So put those two together, and you should start to see LC come back. We're not assuming that in our guide at this point, but definitely there are trends in that direction. Really continuing the trend. So we went from, what, 20 \u2013 so, ecommerce from about 20% to 35% already, 35-plus-percent already in ecommerce, and we expect that to grow closer to 40% by the end of 2024. And in service attachment, having already seen roughly 500 basis points of service attach increase from the time we started the initiative three years ago, we're planning for another 100 basis points of service attachment increase in 2024. So continuing on with our commercial initiatives. I'll start with the order and then I'll let Amol talk about the tax piece. Orders are in line with sales again, direct. So, no real difference between the two for Q4. And the trend from Q3 to Q4, it's almost a 15% ramp from Q3 to Q4. Same thing we saw with orders really, as expected. So, Q4 really landed as we had talked about. Amol, on tax. Derik, fantastic question. our goal in bioanalytical characterization is to make it as simple as it is in small molecules. The QA/QC environment for large molecules in cell and gene therapy should become just as simple. And to do that, you need to take some high end technologies, simplify them, move them into downstream applications, so they're simple to use. LC is already there. Mass spec, the BioAccord has made great strides. Light scattering is ahead of mass spec. So it's going to enter QA/QC sooner. And there are a couple of other technologies, like Raman, like cellular analysis, that also belong in the QA/QC and the process analytical testing domain.  But all of this hinges on having a simple software that the regulators trust, like in power. So, our single largest initiative with Wyatt after delivering our commercial results is to get Wyatt light scattering software onto Empower. And we will have a beta version of that by the end of the year. And I think that's the primary requirement for QA/QC in large molecules to become like small.  So stay tuned, really exciting area. And we're investing in the future while we are navigating the present really, really carefully. Thank you, Caspar. Thank you, Amol. Thank you, everyone, for listening. 2023 has been an unprecedented and challenging year. We've navigated extremely well. As you look at our results outside of China, every end market, every geography grew, which is unusual in this environment amongst our peer group as well. And what is even more pleasing is our focus on cost management. So, really, 70 basis points of margin expansion in the year where the top line went down dramatically is quite an achievement. And we've done that while setting ourselves up very well for the future. We expect the long term growth of our business to be very much intact and accelerate based on what Amol and I described to you.  So thank you, again, for your interest and your attention."

            "content": "Thank you, Udit. And good morning, everyone. We delivered a solid close to a tough year in the fourth quarter with sales that were in line with our expectations despite continued market challenges.  In the quarter, sales declined 4.5% as reported, which aligned with our expectations for 15% increase in reported revenues versus Q3. Organic constant currency sales declined 8% against the high-single-digit growth comparison last year.  We did observe a budget flush in the fourth quarter as sales grew across all geographies in Q4 versus Q3. However, this year's budget flush was more muted than typical, consistent with our expectations.  Our Wyatt acquisition delivered excellent results again, adding over 3% growth to the reported sales.  In organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 11%, industrial declined 4% and academic and government declined 9%. In pharma, our results were impacted by a further weakening in China, which declined 45% for the quarter. Outside of China, pharma sales declined 4% as instruments sales were impacted by a muted budget flush, in line with our expectations.  In industrial, growth was flat outside of China against a tough high-teens prior-year comparison. China declined approximately 20% as weakness has broadened into non-pharma segments due to weak economic conditions. Overall, we observed continued strong growth in PFAS and battery-related applications, which have continued to partially offset weakness in more cyclical areas.  In academic and government, our ex-China Business continued to perform well with mid-single-digit growth. However, this was more than offset by a decline of almost 40% in China, where demand has deteriorated after the benefits of stimulus ended in the second quarter.  By geography, sales in Asia fell 16% as China weakness more than offset mid-single-digit growth in the rest of Asia. The Americas declined 2% and Europe declined 6%, driven by this year's muted budget flush dynamics.  By products and services, instruments declined 20%, recurring revenues grew mid-single-digits, with continued high-single-digit growth outside of China. There was one additional day in the quarter versus the prior year.  Looking now at our full-year results, by end market, pharma declined 5%, industrial was flat, and academic and government grew 10%. Excluding China, pharma and industrial grew low-single-digits and A&G grew mid-teens for the year, each reflecting solid results against double-digit comps.  Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 7%, with China declining more than 20%, while Asia, ex-China, grew high-single-digits. The Americas grew 1% and Europe grew 2%.  By products and services, instruments declined 10%, which was primarily driven by China. Excluding China, instruments declined low-single-digits in 2023, reflecting healthy high-single-digit four-year CAGR. Recurring revenues grew 6% overall and high-single-digits outside of China, with robust growth throughout the year.  Chemistry growth has been supported by strong customer demand for MaxPeak Premier Columns, serving large molecule workflows, and adoption of ecommerce. For service, growth has been supported by expansion of plan attachment. In 2023, we exceeded our objective for a further 100 basis points of service plan attachment and delivered a 200 basis point increase for the year.  Now, I will comment on our fourth quarter and full-year non GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, in 2023, our team responded to these challenges with resilience and commitment.  Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity, and proactive cost alignment, together with lower incentive compensation, allowed us to deliver a fourth quarter gross margin of 61.2%, an expansion of 170 basis points, and fourth quarter adjusted operating margin of 34.9%, an expansion of 120 basis points.  For the full year, our focus and effort resulted in gross margin of 59.6%, an expansion of 160 basis points, and an adjusted operating margin of 30.9%, an expansion of 70 basis points, which is after reinvesting in our high growth adjacencies.  Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, 50 basis points below prior-year quarter. For the full year, it was 16.2%. Our average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 300,000 less than the fourth quarter of last year.  Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $3.62. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $3.65. For the full year, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $11.75. Foreign exchange headwinds lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 3% and there was a 1% dilution from the Wyatt acquisition. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $10.84. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation.  Now turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flows as cash from operation less capital expenditures and exclude special items. In the fourth quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $192 million after funding $42 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, free cash flow was $554 million after funding $161 million of capital expenditures. Excluded from the free cash flow were payments of $72 million related to tax reform, $26 million for Wyatt assumed liabilities, and $16 million related to investment in our Taunton Precision Chemistry operations.  We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This trend allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A, and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation.  At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2 billion, a net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2 times. This represents a decrease of approximately $150 million during the quarter as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition.  As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt transaction. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objective.  Now as we look towards the year ahead, I would like to provide you with our high level thoughts for 2024. Similar to others in the industry, our growth in 2023 was slower than usual, driven by unprecedented weakness in China and cautious spending from customers in other regions. We view these market conditions as temporary and anticipate a gradual recovery in sales growth throughout 2024.  While our customers remain healthy, market uncertainty still remains and necessitates prudence in our guide. These dynamics support full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance of negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on full-year sales. We expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.3% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenues from inorganic sales incurred in the first four and half months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is approximately 0% to 2%.  We expect to extend our strong margin performance into 2024 and deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of additional operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to remain largely consistent with 2023 levels at 16.3%. Our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.  Now rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05, which is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange.  Turning now to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We believe that customer budget release timing will be slower than typical in the first quarter. In addition, current levels of market weakness in China are not fully reflected in last year's first quarter comparison. Last year's deterioration picked up significantly in the second quarter and thereafter. The first quarter also last year benefited from A&G stimulus in China. As a result, we expect our China business to decline approximately 40% year-over-year in Q1.  Given these dynamics, we expect organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 11% to negative 9%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1%, while Wyatt is expected to add approximately 3.5% to sales for the quarter. Therefore, our total first quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 8.5% to negative 6.5%.  Based on these revenue expectations, first quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $2.05 to $2.15, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates.  Now, I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. On pricing, when we started 2023, we started with an assumption of 200 basis points, 250 basis points. But as the year panned out, our team gathered strength quarter after quarter, and you see full year, we finished about 300 basis points on price side.  Now, long term, we've said we'll do about 100 basis points better than what we've historically done. And historically, we had done 50 to 75 basis points. So that's where our current assumption is starting, roughly around 200 basis points of pricing gains in 2024. But, again, the underlying trend is we're doing better than that. And where better to see it, right? It reflects loud and clear in our gross margin expansion, which is where it should show up. We expanded our full year margins by 70 basis points. And on a constant currency basis, that's 120 basis points of expansion because we had a good 50 basis points of FX headwind during the year. The negative leverage from volume was partially offset by mix and AIP. So net-net, it was negative 40 basis points. Pricing added 110 basis points, freight and material savings another 60 basis points, cost actions added another 60 basis points. And then we invested about 70 basis points in nurturing higher growth adjacencies. So that's roughly the breakdown. The one-timers are largely in China. You had the stimulus last year in A&G. And the level of weakness we are seeing now in China, last year's Q1 baseline doesn't reflect that at all. In the rest of the world, we are assuming customers will be slow out of the gate versus what we typically see. And that's based on the trend that we saw in Q4, where the budget flush was muted. And that will somehow, we think, reflect in how quickly budgets are released to customers. And that's sort of playing out in the guide. Just keep in mind, Q1 is our smallest quarter, right? So small changes have a meaningful impact on the pattern. We've sort of looked at it from various different vantage points. If you look at sort of how we've performed ex China, we've grown sort of low single-digits and we expect that to be the case for the full year, with some slow out of the gate with how the budgets are released in Q1. And then, you sort of face a muted budget flush baseline towards the later part of the year.  China, you will see decline, as we talked about, in Q1 because the baseline is pretty strong. But as we get into the second half of China, we think things will normalize because a lot of the demand slowness is reflected. So if you sort of look at it from that vantage point, for the first half, we sort of declined mid-single-digits. For the second half, we sort of grow mid-single-digits. When you look at it on a five year stack versus 2019, roughly, it's mid-single-digits growth both for the first half as well as the second half. China, if you look at 2019 or 2022, was roughly 17% to 19% of our revenue. Now, where we finished in 2023, it's about 15% of our revenue.  When you look at sort of the different issues compounding the current situation in China, but we generally feel, barring maybe one or two smaller issues, most of these issues are cyclical rather than structural. So, for example, CDMOs struggling with overcapacity, as well as geopolitical challenges or branded generics pulling back spend because of anti-corruption campaigns or industrial business, especially food and environmental, slowing down because of government pulling back reimbursement. We think these issues are largely cyclical. They will all come back. It's just a question when, and it's very hard to predict when that will happen.  On the other hand, the biotech funding and the resultant volume they've placed on tier two, tier three CDMOs, that we think is structural. And in the near term, they're not going to be at the levels of 2021, 2022 spending. But at least on that issue, which is structural, the good news is we think we found the bottom on that issue because newer molecules are starting to see funding. But there is going to be sort of $30 million to $40 million correction to our 2022 baseline. The remaining issues we think eventually will come back. And that's the business that is today.  And then, as we've said before, what we are super excited about is this whole push for innovative medicines. And there's a whole new vector opening up in China and we think that will create significant value. And we absolutely want to be part of that equation. And we are taking steps, so that we have local presence and participate in that journey more closely. Derik, great question on tax. So, if you traced last few years with us, the tax rate has gone up roughly about 150 basis points to 200 basis points. And bulk of that is really coming from the US R&D capitalization. And as a company, we've sort of taken a position that Section 174 changes have an ongoing effect on our P&L. And absent of future legislation, we are not excluding those charges from our non-GAAP P&L, which is different from some of us in the sector. But we think those expenses are part of our non-GAAP P&L, and that's the bulk of the change.  The other things that are creeping in there is Singapore going from 0% to 5%. and Ireland adopting Pillar Two, going to 15%. I think 2025, the. big one is, will Singapore adopt and in what form and in what offsets they provide when they do adopt that. So that remains to be seen. We are closely watching that. And as that plays out, we will provide more commentary when that happens."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. This conference call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation third quarter earnings call. Today, I\u2019m joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Water\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Water\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would first like to point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today\u2019s call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.waters.com. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the fourth quarter of 2023, full year 2023 and 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs, and the cautionary language included in this morning\u2019s earnings release. During today\u2019s call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company\u2019s website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 in organic constant currency terms. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today\u2019s call are given on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks for the quarter. Then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I want to start today\u2019s call by thanking my colleagues for remaining focused on our customers, on developing new products and supporting each other. Despite the challenging macro environment, our teams delivered a solid performance and did a great job capitalizing on the available opportunities through strong commercial execution. As headwinds from China and FX became greater, our indomitable teams rallied to drive productivity gains and margin expansion, resulting in strong adjusted earnings growth for the quarter. We launched innovative new products that address the critical unmet needs of our customers and further differentiate our revitalized portfolio in the attractive end markets that we serve. We also continue to make strong progress with Wyatt, including the launch of our first new light scattering instrument. Turning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined by 4%. Sales outside of China were largely at or above our expectations. However, demand in China fell beyond our expectations, which ultimately led to our sales landing at the lower end of our guide. With the U.S. dollar strengthening, the currency impact on sales for the quarter was flat versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind. Wyatt continued its strong start, contributing 4% growth to the quarter as expected. Despite the market challenges and the adverse FX impact, our expand \u2013 we expanded our gross margin percentage by 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin percentage by 380 basis points. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share above our expectations at $2.84, an 8% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. Looking now at our organic constant currency results in more detail. In the Pharma segment, U.S. pharma grew 6% and Europe grew 5% with a strong continuing performance among our large to medium-sized customers despite slow funnel velocity. In China, we saw continued weakness in pharma throughout the quarter. Market challenges in China have now broadened beyond pharma and impacted both our industrial and academic and government end market results in the quarter. Overall sales in China declined approximately 30% as the demand environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed. In the Industrial segment, China declined low-teens. Outside of China, Industrial declined 6% as growth in the quarter was subdued by a tough prior year comparison of over 20%. While the more cyclical applications in Industrial have continued to slow globally, we saw continued strong traction in PFAS and battery testing applications. In academic and government, we continued to see strong uptake of new products in Europe with low-double digit growth, and in the Americas with mid-single digit growth. However, this strength was more than offset by pronounced weakening in China, which declined over 30% now that the shipments related to last year\u2019s stimulus program have concluded. In our core business, while the market environment has become more difficult, we continue to deliver strong commercial results. When looking at our third quarter results outside of China, our organic constant currency sales grew low-single digits year-over-year and is a healthy 7% on a two and four-year stacked basis. On a year-to-date basis, our organic constant currency growth has been mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding China and flat overall, including China. A key driver of performance for our business this year is mass spec, which is an area where we have gained share with our innovative new product portfolio. We\u2019re also managing our P&L very effectively through focus \u2013 through our focus on operational excellence that drove strong margin performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 59.1% a year-over-year expansion of 240 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, expanding 380 basis points. Year-to-date, our results also showed substantial margin expansion with our gross margin up 160 basis points to 59% and our adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 29.4%. Let me talk about what drove this. First, our commercial teams have continued to achieve strong pricing results at levels that were over 250 basis points for the quarter. Second, we\u2019re beginning to realize the productivity benefits of our focus on operational excellence and digitization. I\u2019m excited that next month Waters will celebrate the opening of our new Global Capability Center in Bangalore, India, which will further accelerate our pursuit of digitization and operational excellence. Third, through our proactive cost actions, we have rapidly aligned resources to our long-term growth strategy. While the current market environment is challenging, the long-term fundamentals of our end markets continue to be excellent. As I mentioned last quarter, there are instrumental growth vectors to our historical 5% instrument growth that result in a great long-term growth profile for our business. This includes global prescription drug sales, which are expected to exceed historical growth rates, as well as measures we have put in place to improve pricing, where we expect to sustain a more than 100 basis point improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development for large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for instruments such as mass spec and light scattering in our portfolio. This is only expected to strengthen as end users find value in these instruments for high volume and recurring applications such as process development, raw materials testing and quality control. The competitive edge of our revitalized portfolio also positions us well for long-term growth. Our product portfolio has been renewed in the last few years with significant innovation that is answering the critical unmet needs of our customers. This includes new launches in LC such as the Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in the past decade. In mass spec, the industry leading sensitivity of Xevo TQ Absolute has allowed us to gain share in the food and environmental market for PFAS related testing applications. In chemistry, our MaxPeak Premier columns have been the most successful launch in our company\u2019s history, serving the more complex needs of large molecule separation in our customers\u2019 labs. During the quarter, we announced two new product launches for bioanalytical characterization, including our first new instrument launch with Wyatt. We launched a new Bioprocess Walk-Up Solutions that combines our Andrew+ liquid handling robot, OneLab Software and our BioAccord LCMS system into a more automated setup that is even easier to use. Together, these new products help engineers capture high quality bioprocess and drug product data directly from upstream bioreactors such as those offered by Sartorius. It achieves this via simple workflows that automate sample prep LCMS analysis and data capture. This accelerates the upstream development of MAbs and other biologic drugs, providing more optimal clone selection that results in more effective titles and yields. Second, we launched our first new light scattering instrument within the Wyatt portfolio. DataStar is designed to measure \u2013 to precisely measure and analyze nanoparticles used in downstream biologics and material science applications. It combines three light scattering techniques into a single device, cutting measurement time by up to ten times compared to other methods, while using extremely low sample volumes. I would now like to cover our updated 2023 guidance. Growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. We expect this to decline further in the fourth quarter sequentially. We now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the year versus our prior expectations of low double digits. The result is an incremental headwind to our full year organic constant currency growth of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guidance. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency sales growth to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1%. Despite the lower revenue guide, we\u2019re continuing to proactively manage our cost structure and drive productivity expansion, resulting in no change to our expected margin percentage performance versus our previous guide. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be 30.5%, which is 30 basis points of expansion versus 2022. Our updated full year adjusted EPS guidance is resultantly in the range of $11.65 to $11.75. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined 4% against a mid-teens growth comparison last year. Waters Division and TA both declined 4%. We saw good results again from our Wyatt acquisition, which added 4% constant currency growth and perform in line with our expectations despite the challenging environment. The impact of FX was flat in the quarter, which came in below our expectations of a 1% tailwind to as reported sales. In organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 2%, industrial declined 8%, and academic and government declined 3%. In pharma, mid-single-digit positive growth outside of China was more than offset by continued slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 30%. In industrial, our business declined high single digits with a tough growth comparison of 22% in the prior year quarter, and due to China weakness now spilling over into non-pharma segments. We continued to see strong growth in global PFAS testing and battery testing applications. Academic and government declined 3%. Outside of China, overall A&G growth was up 8%. This was led by double-digit growth in Europe and mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. In China, A&G declined over 30% as demand fell rapidly after we completed shipments under the stimulus program in the first half of the year. By geography, sales in Asia declined 12%, the Americas was flat and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China broadly declined. Excluding China, Asia grew 3%, which was in line with our expectations. India grew low double digits and Japan grew mid-teens. In Americas, pharma grew 6%, which exceeded our expectations as we executed very well with our large to mid pharma customers. Academic and government also grew 6%. However, strength in these two segments was offset by contraction in industrial for the quarter. In Europe, growth exceeded our expectations in pharma, which grew mid-single-digits, and academic and government, which grew 10%, while industrial decline mid-single-digits. By products and segments, instruments declined 13%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single-digits overall and high single digits outside of China. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year\u2019s quarter. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment, together with lower incentive compensation drove continued margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.1%, an expansion of 240 basis points compared to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was approximately 31.5%, an expansion of 380 basis points compared to 27.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% due to discrete items within the quarter. The average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 800,000 less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.84, an increase of 8% despite flat revenue. On GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning\u2019s press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and exclude special items. In the third quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $123 million, after funding $38 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow was impacted by higher inventory balances. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of third quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2.2 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.2. This represents a decrease of $125 million during the quarter, as we deal [ph] with the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down the debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition. We will evaluate resumption of our share repurchase program through the quarter and into the first half of next year. Now, I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. In addition, weakness in China has now broadened beyond pharma and into industrial and academic and government end markets. We expect China growth rates to sequentially decline further in the fourth quarter and now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the full year versus our prior expectations of low double digit decline. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to the range between negative 2% and negative 1%. At current exchange rates where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most major currencies since our last earnings call, currency translation is now expected to have a 1.5% negative impact on our full year sales, which is a 150 basis points headwind versus our prior guide. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now negative 1% to flat. As Udit covered despite incremental headwinds from China and FX, our teams have rallied to drive pricing and productivity gains. We expect this will allow us to deliver a gross margin of approximately 59% for the year, which is in line with our previous guidance and is a 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. Together with proactive cost alignment, we expect this will allow us to deliver an adjusted operating margin of approximately 30.5% for the year after funding investments in high growth adjacencies, which is also in line with our previous guide and it\u2019s 30 basis points of expansion versus last year, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.2 million shares. Our rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.65 to $11.75, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3.5 percentage points at current FX rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect further weakness in China and cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect fourth quarter organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 8% to negative 5%. At today\u2019s rates currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. While we expect Wyatt to add approximately 3.5% to our fourth quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6% to negative 3%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.62, which includes a negative impact from currency of approximately five percentage points at current FX rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a macro environment that has progressively weakened this year, we have continued to deliver a solid performance through our execution. We are also driving strong outcomes in our margin and earnings performance and are maintaining our full year gross margin and adjusted operating margin guidance, despite incremental headwinds from volume and FX. We have strengthened our product portfolio even further through innovation while continuing to make strong progress with our acquisition of Wyatt. Later this month, we look forward to issuing our 2023 ESG report, which is a transparent way to show our active progress each year on our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Some key highlights to expect, relate to our continued reduction of emissions, increased renewable energy use, increase of female representation in management roles, as well as the TCFD related environmental disclosures we are initiating in this year\u2019s report. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We\u2019re now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Udit maybe one on just have the quarter progressed here. What were the exit rates and what is the Q4 guidance implying, right? Because I think the Street\u2019s looking at sequential numbers, rate the sequential step up on a dollar basis Q3 versus Q4, where I think when you look at the growth rates year-on-year, I think your instrumentation growth is mid-teens. So I think it\u2019s just the way we look at year-on-year versus sequential. And I think the Street\u2019s look trying to make the comparison versus your peers and have some companies have guided sequential on a dollar basis and maybe just talk about your exit rates in third quarter? And what is Q4 as you are aiming for instrumentation?\nUdit Batra: So, Vijay, thank you, and good morning. Look, I\u2019ll give you some summary comments and Amol will talk to you about the ramp from Q3 to Q4 if I understand your question correct. When we look at the exit rates and ramp into from Q3 to Q4, we of course look at the performance as we exit Q3. This includes detailed analytics on funnel velocities across the different customer segments, includes what we\u2019ve seen over the last 15 years as we go from Q3 to Q4, and look at that statistically. And of course, a lot of conversations with our customers and we continue to see strength relatively speaking versus our peer group in pharma, especially outside of China. And I\u2019ll let Amol comment a little bit on the sequential ramp up.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Hey, Vijay. Good morning. Look, Vijay, I mean, on the Q3 to Q4 ramp, if you look at our last five years, we averaged roughly a 24% ramp from Q3 to Q4. And where our guide is roughly 13% to 17% ramp from Q3 to Q4. So clearly it\u2019s fairly muted compared to historical levels. Also, if you look at last 15 years, there\u2019ve been just a couple of years in those years, which have come in towards the bottom end of our guide. So that\u2019s why, we feel, generally we\u2019ve muted the ramp from Q3 to Q4. Also, Q3 baseline, which is in this ramp, reflects sort of the slower approval cycles that have been playing out throughout the year. And there\u2019s about one extra day in Q4 this year versus the previous year. And then the last piece is, I mean, it\u2019s based on the fact that yes, there is pain in China at this point. But then when we look at pharma in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan, in India, especially mid to large pharma, our teams are doing a great job there and driving decent outcomes.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful comments Udit and Amol. And one maybe, if Q4 jump off as the minus high singles organic, is China minus 25 for the year, is that done for this year or is that going to spill over into fiscal 2024? Can Waters grow next year? I feel like when I look at the margins here, obviously, leverage will be a question. But I saw that restructuring cost did tick up, so anything on \u2013 any implications for 2024 either on the top and operating leverage?\nUdit Batra: So, Vijay, I\u2019ll comment on China and just, I mean, before we get into any details, I mean, we will only comment on 2024 when we talk about next year, when we talk about Q4 earnings, right. And that\u2019s generally been our policy. As you know, a lot has to evolve from now until the end of the year, especially in our business. So we will not comment on 2024. But on China in particular, look, the quarter \u2013 in the quarter, the business declined about 30% \u2013 in excess of 30% with pharma declining in line with what we had seen at the beginning of the year, right, with CDMOs sort of flushing out over capacity and responding to geopolitical tensions. We think that\u2019s towards the tail end of its development. We saw biotech come under pressure. We think that\u2019s also at the tail end of its pressure just given that high quality molecules are being funded also in China. And then the third piece was in pharma, the Branded Generic segment, which is roughly 50% of our sales in the Pharma segment in China. And this one here, there was an additional pressure that we learned about, which is the anti-corruption campaign that the Chinese government issued. So while our customers are used to value \u2013 responding to value-based pricing cuts this was a new headwind. So that is still in progress. So in all pharma, two out of three vectors are starting to subside. The third one is new over the quarter. And this is something that I learned over the last couple of months when I visited China. When switching over to other segments, look the Industrial segment, we see great growth in batteries in China, but that was not enough to offset the macro sensitive Food and Environmental segments, which dropped further in this quarter. And then finally, the Academic and Government segment, as Amol commented in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing the tail end of the benefit from the stimulus from last year and that will sort of come out of the numbers now. Now, if you put it all together and put it in perspective, we started the year with about 19%, 20% of Waters\u2019 sales coming from China. With our current guide, we expect that to be about 12% to 13% of our overall sales. So while we remain super optimistic about what we expect in China in the future and it has become a much smaller proportion of our business than at the beginning of the \u2013 then at the beginning of the year.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions here. Maybe just on pharma, ex-China, obviously you kind of discussed positive trends in the quarter and kind of what you guys are expecting for the fourth quarter. But we\u2019ve heard a lot of mixed comments in the quarter. So maybe can you just give us a flavor for maybe a little more details on [indiscernible] trends and kind of water specifically how you\u2019re doing, you think first to [ph] broader trends. And again, maybe Amol, I know you gave some color in fourth quarter, but just how should we be thinking about pharma in the fourth quarter ex-China?\nUdit Batra: So Dan, thank you for the question. Look pharma is almost a tale of two stories, right? I mean, overall, we saw the quarter decline low single digits. And in China as expected, roughly 30% or so decline that I just commented on. If we look at ex-China I mean, we\u2019ve printed, I would say amongst our peer group, probably the most positive numbers in growth in China growing mid-single digit. And this is across Europe, across Americas and across the rest of APAC where we saw significant strength in India and Japan. And this is behind two factors. One really our new product portfolio is gaining a lot of traction, despite the slow funnel velocities that we see in mid to large pharma and additional approval levels, despite the fact that biotech came under pressure at the beginning of the year, it\u2019s starting to see \u2013 it\u2019s starting to become a little bit less pressured as we exit the year. So in pharma, our new product portfolio has done super well start with LC. The Alliance iS we have had significant orders. And as I mentioned, despite the macro pressures, customers have placed large orders for Alliance iS. And the funnel looks really healthy. Mass spec has been a real star for the year. And in pharma, we have specifically developed biologics applications, and you saw the recent launch of the walk-up solution for BioAccord, which should make process development even faster. The MaxPeak Premier column staying on the theme of biologics is in its third year and still growing in well into the 20% range. So been the strongest launch for us in columns for many, many years. And we recently introduced another column that is targeted towards AAV and cell and gene therapy. So really excited about what we\u2019ve seen in pharma this year, despite a difficult environment and feel like we\u2019re gaining share. And over the long term, pharma is \u2013 remains a source of strength. We don\u2019t expect to grow mid-single digits. We expect to grow high single digits and double digits as we look into the future. So I\u2019m super excited about what we are seeing in the pipelines from our customers. I mean, we are very well specked in the GLP-1s and the Alzheimer\u2019s compounds. So really optimistic about the future and proud of the team\u2019s execution and I would say a challenging macro environment. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Just to sort of touch on your other question. Look, I mean, pharma overall declined low single digits for us in Q3. And then for Q4, what is embedded in the guide is sort of a mid-single digit decline. Obviously that includes China. When you strip China out for the rest of the markets, the rest of the markets grew a little under mid-single digits in Q3. And then in Q4, we are expecting them to still grow, but not at the same level in Q3, a little bit less than what they grew in Q3.\nDan Brennan: Got it. No, thanks for that. And then just maybe on the instrument recurring revenue, just maybe could you just give us a little bit of an overview of kind of what you\u2019re seeing there. Obviously trying to complicate things, but just wondering the steadiness of that recurring revenue. Like, are you seeing any changes there? Just kind of any flavor about how the quarter went and kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the outlook for 4Q? Thanks.\nUdit Batra: So let\u2019s start with recurring and then I comment on instruments. So recurring revenue came in mid-single digits this quarter around 4%. Chemistry, low single digits at 1%, service 5%. This is globally. Now, if you strip China out recurring revenues are, again, high single digits, close to seven plus percent with chemistry in the high single digit range, service in the mid-single digit range. So really healthy growth outside of China. And then China really impacted the chemistry piece, just given the less activity that we saw with our branded generics customers. And then if I switch to Instruments. Instruments were dropped low teens globally right and similar drops across LC, mass spec and TA, so minus 14%, minus 12% something like this across the whole portfolio. But again if you strip out China which saw significant declines. And here I want to take it each in turn right. LC as we saw in the last quarter, low single digit growth outside of China. This quarter it was flat, right. So really hovering around I would say flattish growth for the last two quarters. Just as we had talked about a few quarters ago when we saw mid-teens decline in LC and customers will have to replace their fleets and we\u2019re starting to see that happen with some large pharma customers. So you see LC is sort of hovering around flattish to low-single digit growth. Mass spec ex-China came in at about 10% decline. Now, I will remind you that same time last quarter mass spec grew almost 40%, almost 40%. Super excited about what we\u2019ve seen with the mass spec portfolio and its adoption in virtually every account that we go and compete with the Xevo TQ Absolute we win, if you go with our bio portfolio now, especially with BioAccord, Xevo TQ, Xevo G3 QTof, we see significant seeding and adoption there. So mass spec has gone from strength to strength and we see that continuing. And TA again also declined high-single digits but again on a comp of about 20%. So if you again go back to mass spec, if you look at two-year, four-year CAGRs I mean we are well into the high-teens with mass spec growth. So quite excited about what we\u2019ve seen with instruments and if you just again cast your eye to the longer-term trends, instruments grow roughly 5%, have grown over 5% over a long-term and we are seeing as we go forward about 100 basis points of higher pricing. We see increased prescription rates with new molecules coming through and our new product portfolio driving adoption across new segments like PFAS so excited about what we are seeing, what we\u2019re \u2013 the execution we\u2019re seeing with instruments across the Board and what we expect in the future to be better growth than what we\u2019ve seen also in the past.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just first on pricing, just given the margin gains you saw this quarter in your comment about 250 basis points of price. We\u2019ve heard from peers that sort of pricing is starting to trend back towards normalized levels and probably less of a tailwind. Could you just maybe comment on what your expectations for price are in Q4? And then as we go into 2024, how much of a tailwind do you believe pricing will continue to be for you.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, Matt, good morning, and thanks for your question. Look, I mean, ever since we went through the inflationary cycle last year, that gave us opportunity to put good systems and processes around pricing. And if you look at Waters\u2019 history, traditionally we\u2019ve done 50 basis points to 75 basis points. And last year was very different. And our teams have continued to execute on that sort of system and process pathway. So we started the year with about little over 200 basis points and it\u2019s only got stronger as we came into Q3 with little over 250 basis points. And then we expect something similar in Q4, which then for the full year, we will be little over 250 basis points. And that\u2019s sort of driving a third of our operating margin expansion for the quarter.\nUdit Batra: And I think, just to conclude on this, Matt, look, pricing is dependent upon, as Amol said, good execution, good systems, good processes, but it\u2019s equally dependent on a differentiated portfolio. We\u2019ve renewed our full portfolio across instruments and it\u2019s got very high receptivity from customers. So customers are responding to good innovation across instruments. But also on the column side where the stick rates are tremendous, right? I mean, with the MaxPeak Premier, with new columns introduced for AAV applications, I mean, we are highly differentiated amongst the peer groups. So we do expect pricing to stick at reasonably high levels.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thank you for that color. And then just as a follow-up, just zeroing in on China, specifically on the Industrial side, you talked about strength in batteries, but food and I believe environmental weakening in the quarter. Could you maybe talk about the dynamics there? I mean, I think that\u2019s relatively new information relative to what we\u2019ve been hearing and just wanted to understand the dynamics within the Industrial demand inside China and what your sort of expectations are for duration of that we had?\nUdit Batra: Good one, Matt. Look, I mean, Industrial came in below our expectations for the quarter in China and that drove the weakness across the globe. And you\u2019re right to divide it into two parts. I mean, there are the resilient segments like PFAS testing as well as batteries especially in China, where we\u2019re seeing very good uptake. The challenge is the more macro dependent segments like materials, like food, which are also funded by the government were impacted by the slowdown of the economy. And as you look ahead, I would simply model those in proportion to the economic recovery that we would expect in China. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. Now, outside of China, of course, I mean, you didn\u2019t ask this, but outside of China, again, we saw a bit of a slowdown against very, very strong comps, right? On a long-term basis outside of China, we\u2019re seeing mid to high-single digit growth in Industrial. I mean, you should expect a mid-single digit growth for the long-term in Industrial. But in China, for sure, there was additional weakness largely related to the macro sensitive segments like materials and food and the like.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, first one is looking at the Q3 to Q4 step down in operating expenses. How much of that was incentive comp that can come back? How much of that is going to be sustained as we look into 2024? Can you just sort of give us some thoughts on just how we should think about the operating expenses as we move in to Q4 and to next year?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, Derik, thanks for your question. I mean as we had discussed in our last earnings call, right, where we had to make some tough but necessary decisions to reduce our workforce by about 5%. And we did that at the beginning of Q3, and that resulted in approximately $10 million of savings in Q3 that is in our Q3 results. We expect for 2023, roughly $20 million. So another $10 million in Q4. And the annualized impact, which will play out next year would be about $40 million. Again, we may invest some of it to fund some of the high growth adjacencies, but before that annualized, its $40 million. And we incurred about $27 million associated with severance expenses for this restructuring, which is in our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment. Now, keep in mind, in Q3, the way it sort of played out is we had lower volume on our organic business, so we lost some volume leverage. And so, essentially, the reduction in AIP plus the accretion for Wyatt more or less offsetted the lack of volume leverage from the underlying business. And then the three factors which are pricing, these cost actions that I just talked about, and then the underlying productivity initiatives playing out on freight and procurement and the capability center, they each contributed roughly a third of the 380 basis points.\nUdit Batra: And Derik, just to conclude, sort of rather qualitatively, I mean this is in the DNA of Waters, right? I mean, we are one of the highest margin companies in the peer group. And back when I joined three years ago, people said, you can\u2019t expand your margins. You\u2019re maxed out. I mean, quarter-on-quarter, we continue to focus on, as Amol mentioned, really careful cost management, pricing and difficult actions when we need to take them. And the exit for the full year is around 30.5, which is 30 basis points of margin expansion, despite the fact that volume went against what we had assumed. And FX was also a headwind, right? So I mean I\u2019m extremely grateful to all my colleagues for putting their heads down and being super responsible with costs when the volume didn\u2019t come and we had to respond rather rapidly, right? So I wanted to make that point.\nDerik De Bruin: Thanks for the clarity. Just wanted a follow-up. I appreciate that Waters has a lot of new products, and those are probably giving you a little bit more incremental growth, but I mean I\u2019m just a little bit surprised of your guidance outside of China. These are not normal market conditions, and I know you\u2019re putting in some conservatism, but I haven\u2019t seen markets like this before and these swings that we\u2019re seeing. So it\u2019s just wondering why you guided as aggressively as you did for the fourth quarter and your competence, because it just feels like you\u2019ve got a little bit of a budget flush that\u2019s in there outside of China and just a little bit more clarity on that. Thank you.\nUdit Batra: I think Derik, this is what Amol started with. First is the baseline from and all the input that goes into Q4, right? So we look at how the funnel velocities are. I mean, if I just stay with pharma for a minute, the quality of the orders is very high, right? Customers who place orders are actually buying. They\u2019ve just bought over \u2013 yes, they just \u2013 the order to sales conversion is just a bit longer than it\u2019s been in the past, right? The new products \u2013 and the new products have a lot to do with it. Customers are responding to innovation, especially in pharma, right? And you saw mid-single digit growth this quarter. So that goes into our calculations. Second, we looked at historical ramp rates, and when you look at historical ramp rates, the lower end of our guide, which is 13% ramp from Q3 to Q4 is one of the lowest in the last 15 years, right? And I appreciate I mean both of us have been in this industry for a long time, and these are unprecedented times, but this is sort of lowest \u2013 one of the lowest ramps that we\u2019ve seen in many, many years. And then the third is customer conversations, right? So we\u2019re talking to customers. I\u2019m spending a lot of time with them, and it\u2019s clear that we are seeing, I would say, asynchronous good execution in pharma. That gives us the confidence to sort of say, okay, Q4 is going to be like we have projected. And we have \u2013 that\u2019s why we have \u2013 and largely because of the uncertainty, we have ranged the Q4 guide wider than we have in the past, right? So I appreciate your question and appreciate the historical context. We took a lot of the facts into account in guiding wider than we have in the past. And as I said, look, new products, great execution with the hand that we have, I think we\u2019re doing extremely, extremely well, especially outside the U.S. Amol, anything else to add on the guide?\nAmol Chaubal: No, no, I think you covered it.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Derik.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to follow-up on that answer to Derik\u2019s question around some of the order rates. You mentioned that the quality of orders have been high, but it\u2019s just that conversion to sales is taking a little bit longer. Can you give us any stats from order rates, book-to-bills, whether that\u2019s pharma, ex-pharma, and then looking at total world versus ex-China as well, and kind of how that\u2019s trending into 4Q?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean, look, if you sort of see how the year has played out, we did see funnel velocity slow down across all the trade classes, especially pharma in Q1. And then as we\u2019ve gone through Q2 and Q3, the funnel velocity has sort of stayed where it is at a higher level. So it\u2019s taking more time for people to approve these orders. And we expect that to continue through Q4. What we haven\u2019t seen in pharma, which is good, is we haven\u2019t seen projects getting canceled. And so opportunities are landing, they\u2019re just taking more time to land. And in terms of sort of sales versus orders, I mean, they\u2019re going hand in hand. It\u2019s not that we are meaningfully drawing down backlog in any quarter or the whole. The one place where the trajectory has changed somewhat is in the industrial trade class. And this is all outside of China I\u2019m talking about. And there, while the funnel velocity had progressively slowed in Q1 and Q2, we hadn\u2019t seen any opportunities getting canceled. And what we are seeing in Q3 is and again, don\u2019t confuse this with orders. No customers are canceling orders. But when the opportunity is in the CRM system, from lead gen to conversion, we are seeing elevated levels of projects getting canceled for lack of funding or funding not available in the current year, particularly in testing labs. And that we saw sort of emerge in Q3. And then China, I mean, we\u2019ve sort of covered that before, which is a different story, much more painful. That started in Q1 with tier 1 CDMOs and then sort of progressively went into tier 2, tier 3 CDMOs and biotechs with investor funding and then played out in branded generics with VBP and anticorruption drives, which haven\u2019t bottomed yet and then has spilled over into the industrial and A&G, especially as the stimulus money is done for A&G.\nUdit Batra: And then Rachel, just one last comment on Q3 and the ramp to Q4. I mean, the trends we are seeing in Q3, what gives us confidence, especially in pharma and with mass spec, with LC, that they\u2019ll persist is we saw exactly the same thing in Q2. And I think we probably had the same discussion, why are we seeing better performance in pharma than the peer group? Why are we seeing LCs sort of flatten out? It\u2019s the same reasoning and we\u2019re seeing the same customer feedback. So I think it\u2019s reasonable to project that into Q4.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Eve Burstein from Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nEve Burstein: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions. One, both high growth, growth adjacency related. So for Wyatt, it seems not to have felt as much pressure as your core instruments. And it makes sense that there wouldn\u2019t have been as much COVID pull forward there as in LC, for example. But are you still seeing lengthening sales cycles and some of those same signs of demand weakness for Wyatt Technology? And then for the other high growth adjacencies, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times about reinvesting funding investments affecting your adjusted operating margin. Can you talk about how the pressures in the industry and pressures on your top line have potentially lengthened some of the timelines that you\u2019re looking at to go after those high growth adjacencies?\nUdit Batra: Thanks for the question, Eve. I\u2019ll start with the Wyatt question. Look, I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with the way the integration is going. I mean, that should be the general takeaway and you can see that in the facts, right, basically a 4% contribution this quarter and 2.5% for the year. So we think we are going to deliver that. And when you look at the drivers, the integration is growing faster than we had initially even imagined. There are exactly the same headwinds. The funnel velocities are longer. It is taking more time for customers to place orders. But number one, given the larger commercial field force that Waters had, we were able to use that to generate a lot more leads for our light scattering instruments from Wyatt, which are highly differentiated in the market. So as we got more leads, we got more conversions and the funnels moving nicely through. Second, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time in making it easier for customers to connect Waters as LCs to multi-angle light scattering instruments from Wyatt, and that\u2019s well ahead of target. And third, we had talked earlier when we talked about the synergy contributions, we had talked about columns from Waters being substituted for other competitors columns and that\u2019s gone extremely well. So every light scattering equipment that is sold now is sold with a Waters SEC column, which are the best-in-class. So integration going very well, but the largest driver, I would say, of short-term results and overcoming the obvious headwinds is the larger number of leads that are Waters account managers have provided the Wyatt specialists. And as you look ahead, I mean, really optimistic about what we are seeing with the collaboration across the two organizations. Our Wyatt colleagues were present at the Innovation Summit recently, which basically invites over 300 or so R&D scientists around the globe for a hybrid session. We had many posters from Wyatt colleagues looking at collaborations across the organization. So I\u2019m extremely pleased with where things are going. And we recently launched the ZetaStar, which combines three light scattering technologies into one. So Wyatt\u2019s going extremely well, and thank you for the opportunity to expound on that. Now, on the high growth adjacencies, the 30.5% operating margin that we are committing to for the full year includes the 70 to 80 basis points that we had said that we would invest, we had started to invest that early in the year. We are seeing very nice outcomes of that, especially in our clinical business where the team has developed many, many assays, simplified workflows for difficult to do experiments with LCMS and making it a much more easier experiment for customers who want to use LCMS in specialty diagnostics areas like for Alzheimer\u2019s testing \u2013 like for testing antibodies for Alzheimer\u2019s as just a case in point. So the high growth adjacencies are delivering. Now we will look at the net picture as we look at the full year and how it lands and we will talk about how we\u2019re going to invest and continue to invest in the high growth adjacencies as we give guidance at the beginning of next year.\nEve Burstein: Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Catherine Schulte from Baird. Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first just to touch on some of your commercial initiatives here, any comments on service attachment rates and e-commerce trends and how those are tracking relative to your expectations?\nUdit Batra: Yes. So service attachment rates \u2013 So Catherine, thank you for the question. Service attachment rates are well ahead of target. You\u2019ll remember that we committed to 100 basis points of increase in attachment rates. We\u2019re well ahead of that. So we\u2019ll likely exit the year with 200 basis points of increase in service attachment rates. And you would see that in the growth that is being seen, especially outside of China for service, which is basically high single digit growth for year-to-date and the balance of the year. So service is going quite well. On e-commerce as well, we\u2019ve gone from about 20%, 25% of products going through e-commerce to well in excess of 30%, closer to 35% now that the team is highly focused on that. I mean, as you can imagine, given the slowdown in the overall market, our Chemistry portfolio has still done pretty well and the Chemistry portfolio is benefiting from additional products going through e-commerce. So Chemistry is currently growing high single digits and benefiting from the additional focus on e-commerce.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay, great. And then you had impressive operating margin results in the third quarter. I think to get to your 30.5 for the full year, that implies somewhere between 33% and 34% in the fourth quarter. I know fourth quarter margins are often seasonally high, but should we think of the 31.5 that we saw in the third quarter as a jumping off point for 2024 or just walk through the moving pieces there? Thanks.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean, look, if you look at how we\u2019ve performed in adversity, like last year, there was tremendous inflationary pressure and dollar kept becoming stronger and stronger, right. And despite all of that, our teams rallied to find pricing gains and productivity gains and sort of land a margin equal or better than the prior year. And then this year, again, we\u2019ve sort of gone through demand challenges and then also further strengthening of U.S. dollar. And despite that, we found ways to defend margin through pricing, through productivity, through cost alignment. So we really feel good about how our teams have responded in these situations. Now, as you look at 2024, I mean, as Udit outlined, right, it\u2019s a little early because we want to see how the next two months play out. They are a big part of our year. We are also just rolling up our bottoms up AOP, and we want to sort of review that before we sort of talk about 2024. So like we always do at our Q4 earnings call, we will provide more details and guidance for 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions.\nUdit Batra: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in Waters. A replay of this call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at future events and conferences.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. That concludes the Waters Corporation third quarter 2023 financial results conference call. You may disconnect at this time and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. I want to start today's call by thanking my colleagues for remaining focused on our customers, on developing new products and supporting each other. Despite the challenging macro environment, our teams delivered a solid performance and did a great job capitalizing on the available opportunities through strong commercial execution. As headwinds from China and FX became greater, our indomitable teams rallied to drive productivity gains and margin expansion, resulting in strong adjusted earnings growth for the quarter. We launched innovative new products that address the critical unmet needs of our customers and further differentiate our revitalized portfolio in the attractive end markets that we serve. We also continue to make strong progress with Wyatt, including the launch of our first new light scattering instrument. Turning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined by 4%. Sales outside of China were largely at or above our expectations. However, demand in China fell beyond our expectations, which ultimately led to our sales landing at the lower end of our guide. With the U.S. dollar strengthening, the currency impact on sales for the quarter was flat versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind. Wyatt continued its strong start, contributing 4% growth to the quarter as expected. Despite the market challenges and the adverse FX impact, our expand \u2013 we expanded our gross margin percentage by 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin percentage by 380 basis points. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share above our expectations at $2.84, an 8% increase. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. Looking now at our organic constant currency results in more detail. In the Pharma segment, U.S. pharma grew 6% and Europe grew 5% with a strong continuing performance among our large to medium-sized customers despite slow funnel velocity. In China, we saw continued weakness in pharma throughout the quarter. Market challenges in China have now broadened beyond pharma and impacted both our industrial and academic and government end market results in the quarter. Overall sales in China declined approximately 30% as the demand environment further deteriorated as the quarter progressed. In the Industrial segment, China declined low-teens. Outside of China, Industrial declined 6% as growth in the quarter was subdued by a tough prior year comparison of over 20%. While the more cyclical applications in Industrial have continued to slow globally, we saw continued strong traction in PFAS and battery testing applications. In academic and government, we continued to see strong uptake of new products in Europe with low-double digit growth, and in the Americas with mid-single digit growth. However, this strength was more than offset by pronounced weakening in China, which declined over 30% now that the shipments related to last year's stimulus program have concluded. In our core business, while the market environment has become more difficult, we continue to deliver strong commercial results. When looking at our third quarter results outside of China, our organic constant currency sales grew low-single digits year-over-year and is a healthy 7% on a two and four-year stacked basis. On a year-to-date basis, our organic constant currency growth has been mid-single digits year-over-year, excluding China and flat overall, including China. A key driver of performance for our business this year is mass spec, which is an area where we have gained share with our innovative new product portfolio. We're also managing our P&L very effectively through focus \u2013 through our focus on operational excellence that drove strong margin performance in the quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, our gross margin was 59.1% a year-over-year expansion of 240 basis points. Our adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, expanding 380 basis points. Year-to-date, our results also showed substantial margin expansion with our gross margin up 160 basis points to 59% and our adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 29.4%. Let me talk about what drove this. First, our commercial teams have continued to achieve strong pricing results at levels that were over 250 basis points for the quarter. Second, we're beginning to realize the productivity benefits of our focus on operational excellence and digitization. I'm excited that next month Waters will celebrate the opening of our new Global Capability Center in Bangalore, India, which will further accelerate our pursuit of digitization and operational excellence. Third, through our proactive cost actions, we have rapidly aligned resources to our long-term growth strategy. While the current market environment is challenging, the long-term fundamentals of our end markets continue to be excellent. As I mentioned last quarter, there are instrumental growth vectors to our historical 5% instrument growth that result in a great long-term growth profile for our business. This includes global prescription drug sales, which are expected to exceed historical growth rates, as well as measures we have put in place to improve pricing, where we expect to sustain a more than 100 basis point improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development for large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for instruments such as mass spec and light scattering in our portfolio. This is only expected to strengthen as end users find value in these instruments for high volume and recurring applications such as process development, raw materials testing and quality control. The competitive edge of our revitalized portfolio also positions us well for long-term growth. Our product portfolio has been renewed in the last few years with significant innovation that is answering the critical unmet needs of our customers. This includes new launches in LC such as the Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in the past decade. In mass spec, the industry leading sensitivity of Xevo TQ Absolute has allowed us to gain share in the food and environmental market for PFAS related testing applications. In chemistry, our MaxPeak Premier columns have been the most successful launch in our company's history, serving the more complex needs of large molecule separation in our customers' labs. During the quarter, we announced two new product launches for bioanalytical characterization, including our first new instrument launch with Wyatt. We launched a new Bioprocess Walk-Up Solutions that combines our Andrew+ liquid handling robot, OneLab Software and our BioAccord LCMS system into a more automated setup that is even easier to use. Together, these new products help engineers capture high quality bioprocess and drug product data directly from upstream bioreactors such as those offered by Sartorius. It achieves this via simple workflows that automate sample prep LCMS analysis and data capture. This accelerates the upstream development of MAbs and other biologic drugs, providing more optimal clone selection that results in more effective titles and yields. Second, we launched our first new light scattering instrument within the Wyatt portfolio. DataStar is designed to measure \u2013 to precisely measure and analyze nanoparticles used in downstream biologics and material science applications. It combines three light scattering techniques into a single device, cutting measurement time by up to ten times compared to other methods, while using extremely low sample volumes. I would now like to cover our updated 2023 guidance. Growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. We expect this to decline further in the fourth quarter sequentially. We now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the year versus our prior expectations of low double digits. The result is an incremental headwind to our full year organic constant currency growth of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guidance. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency sales growth to be in the range of negative 2% to negative 1%. Despite the lower revenue guide, we're continuing to proactively manage our cost structure and drive productivity expansion, resulting in no change to our expected margin percentage performance versus our previous guide. We expect our full year adjusted operating margin to be 30.5%, which is 30 basis points of expansion versus 2022. Our updated full year adjusted EPS guidance is resultantly in the range of $11.65 to $11.75. Now, I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our third quarter financial results in more detail and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol? Thank you, Amol. So to summarize, despite a macro environment that has progressively weakened this year, we have continued to deliver a solid performance through our execution. We are also driving strong outcomes in our margin and earnings performance and are maintaining our full year gross margin and adjusted operating margin guidance, despite incremental headwinds from volume and FX. We have strengthened our product portfolio even further through innovation while continuing to make strong progress with our acquisition of Wyatt. Later this month, we look forward to issuing our 2023 ESG report, which is a transparent way to show our active progress each year on our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Some key highlights to expect, relate to our continued reduction of emissions, increased renewable energy use, increase of female representation in management roles, as well as the TCFD related environmental disclosures we are initiating in this year's report. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. So, Vijay, thank you, and good morning. Look, I'll give you some summary comments and Amol will talk to you about the ramp from Q3 to Q4 if I understand your question correct. When we look at the exit rates and ramp into from Q3 to Q4, we of course look at the performance as we exit Q3. This includes detailed analytics on funnel velocities across the different customer segments, includes what we've seen over the last 15 years as we go from Q3 to Q4, and look at that statistically. And of course, a lot of conversations with our customers and we continue to see strength relatively speaking versus our peer group in pharma, especially outside of China. And I'll let Amol comment a little bit on the sequential ramp up. So, Vijay, I'll comment on China and just, I mean, before we get into any details, I mean, we will only comment on 2024 when we talk about next year, when we talk about Q4 earnings, right. And that's generally been our policy. As you know, a lot has to evolve from now until the end of the year, especially in our business. So we will not comment on 2024. But on China in particular, look, the quarter \u2013 in the quarter, the business declined about 30% \u2013 in excess of 30% with pharma declining in line with what we had seen at the beginning of the year, right, with CDMOs sort of flushing out over capacity and responding to geopolitical tensions. We think that's towards the tail end of its development. We saw biotech come under pressure. We think that's also at the tail end of its pressure just given that high quality molecules are being funded also in China. And then the third piece was in pharma, the Branded Generic segment, which is roughly 50% of our sales in the Pharma segment in China. And this one here, there was an additional pressure that we learned about, which is the anti-corruption campaign that the Chinese government issued. So while our customers are used to value \u2013 responding to value-based pricing cuts this was a new headwind. So that is still in progress. So in all pharma, two out of three vectors are starting to subside. The third one is new over the quarter. And this is something that I learned over the last couple of months when I visited China. When switching over to other segments, look the Industrial segment, we see great growth in batteries in China, but that was not enough to offset the macro sensitive Food and Environmental segments, which dropped further in this quarter. And then finally, the Academic and Government segment, as Amol commented in the prepared remarks, we're seeing the tail end of the benefit from the stimulus from last year and that will sort of come out of the numbers now. Now, if you put it all together and put it in perspective, we started the year with about 19%, 20% of Waters' sales coming from China. With our current guide, we expect that to be about 12% to 13% of our overall sales. So while we remain super optimistic about what we expect in China in the future and it has become a much smaller proportion of our business than at the beginning of the \u2013 then at the beginning of the year. So Dan, thank you for the question. Look pharma is almost a tale of two stories, right? I mean, overall, we saw the quarter decline low single digits. And in China as expected, roughly 30% or so decline that I just commented on. If we look at ex-China I mean, we've printed, I would say amongst our peer group, probably the most positive numbers in growth in China growing mid-single digit. And this is across Europe, across Americas and across the rest of APAC where we saw significant strength in India and Japan. And this is behind two factors. One really our new product portfolio is gaining a lot of traction, despite the slow funnel velocities that we see in mid to large pharma and additional approval levels, despite the fact that biotech came under pressure at the beginning of the year, it's starting to see \u2013 it's starting to become a little bit less pressured as we exit the year. So in pharma, our new product portfolio has done super well start with LC. The Alliance iS we have had significant orders. And as I mentioned, despite the macro pressures, customers have placed large orders for Alliance iS. And the funnel looks really healthy. Mass spec has been a real star for the year. And in pharma, we have specifically developed biologics applications, and you saw the recent launch of the walk-up solution for BioAccord, which should make process development even faster. The MaxPeak Premier column staying on the theme of biologics is in its third year and still growing in well into the 20% range. So been the strongest launch for us in columns for many, many years. And we recently introduced another column that is targeted towards AAV and cell and gene therapy. So really excited about what we've seen in pharma this year, despite a difficult environment and feel like we're gaining share. And over the long term, pharma is \u2013 remains a source of strength. We don't expect to grow mid-single digits. We expect to grow high single digits and double digits as we look into the future. So I'm super excited about what we are seeing in the pipelines from our customers. I mean, we are very well specked in the GLP-1s and the Alzheimer's compounds. So really optimistic about the future and proud of the team's execution and I would say a challenging macro environment. Amol? So let's start with recurring and then I comment on instruments. So recurring revenue came in mid-single digits this quarter around 4%. Chemistry, low single digits at 1%, service 5%. This is globally. Now, if you strip China out recurring revenues are, again, high single digits, close to seven plus percent with chemistry in the high single digit range, service in the mid-single digit range. So really healthy growth outside of China. And then China really impacted the chemistry piece, just given the less activity that we saw with our branded generics customers. And then if I switch to Instruments. Instruments were dropped low teens globally right and similar drops across LC, mass spec and TA, so minus 14%, minus 12% something like this across the whole portfolio. But again if you strip out China which saw significant declines. And here I want to take it each in turn right. LC as we saw in the last quarter, low single digit growth outside of China. This quarter it was flat, right. So really hovering around I would say flattish growth for the last two quarters. Just as we had talked about a few quarters ago when we saw mid-teens decline in LC and customers will have to replace their fleets and we're starting to see that happen with some large pharma customers. So you see LC is sort of hovering around flattish to low-single digit growth. Mass spec ex-China came in at about 10% decline. Now, I will remind you that same time last quarter mass spec grew almost 40%, almost 40%. Super excited about what we've seen with the mass spec portfolio and its adoption in virtually every account that we go and compete with the Xevo TQ Absolute we win, if you go with our bio portfolio now, especially with BioAccord, Xevo TQ, Xevo G3 QTof, we see significant seeding and adoption there. So mass spec has gone from strength to strength and we see that continuing. And TA again also declined high-single digits but again on a comp of about 20%. So if you again go back to mass spec, if you look at two-year, four-year CAGRs I mean we are well into the high-teens with mass spec growth. So quite excited about what we've seen with instruments and if you just again cast your eye to the longer-term trends, instruments grow roughly 5%, have grown over 5% over a long-term and we are seeing as we go forward about 100 basis points of higher pricing. We see increased prescription rates with new molecules coming through and our new product portfolio driving adoption across new segments like PFAS so excited about what we are seeing, what we're \u2013 the execution we're seeing with instruments across the Board and what we expect in the future to be better growth than what we've seen also in the past. And I think, just to conclude on this, Matt, look, pricing is dependent upon, as Amol said, good execution, good systems, good processes, but it's equally dependent on a differentiated portfolio. We've renewed our full portfolio across instruments and it's got very high receptivity from customers. So customers are responding to good innovation across instruments. But also on the column side where the stick rates are tremendous, right? I mean, with the MaxPeak Premier, with new columns introduced for AAV applications, I mean, we are highly differentiated amongst the peer groups. So we do expect pricing to stick at reasonably high levels. Good one, Matt. Look, I mean, Industrial came in below our expectations for the quarter in China and that drove the weakness across the globe. And you're right to divide it into two parts. I mean, there are the resilient segments like PFAS testing as well as batteries especially in China, where we're seeing very good uptake. The challenge is the more macro dependent segments like materials, like food, which are also funded by the government were impacted by the slowdown of the economy. And as you look ahead, I would simply model those in proportion to the economic recovery that we would expect in China. And that's how we're looking at it. Now, outside of China, of course, I mean, you didn't ask this, but outside of China, again, we saw a bit of a slowdown against very, very strong comps, right? On a long-term basis outside of China, we're seeing mid to high-single digit growth in Industrial. I mean, you should expect a mid-single digit growth for the long-term in Industrial. But in China, for sure, there was additional weakness largely related to the macro sensitive segments like materials and food and the like. And Derik, just to conclude, sort of rather qualitatively, I mean this is in the DNA of Waters, right? I mean, we are one of the highest margin companies in the peer group. And back when I joined three years ago, people said, you can't expand your margins. You're maxed out. I mean, quarter-on-quarter, we continue to focus on, as Amol mentioned, really careful cost management, pricing and difficult actions when we need to take them. And the exit for the full year is around 30.5, which is 30 basis points of margin expansion, despite the fact that volume went against what we had assumed. And FX was also a headwind, right? So I mean I'm extremely grateful to all my colleagues for putting their heads down and being super responsible with costs when the volume didn't come and we had to respond rather rapidly, right? So I wanted to make that point. I think Derik, this is what Amol started with. First is the baseline from and all the input that goes into Q4, right? So we look at how the funnel velocities are. I mean, if I just stay with pharma for a minute, the quality of the orders is very high, right? Customers who place orders are actually buying. They've just bought over \u2013 yes, they just \u2013 the order to sales conversion is just a bit longer than it's been in the past, right? The new products \u2013 and the new products have a lot to do with it. Customers are responding to innovation, especially in pharma, right? And you saw mid-single digit growth this quarter. So that goes into our calculations. Second, we looked at historical ramp rates, and when you look at historical ramp rates, the lower end of our guide, which is 13% ramp from Q3 to Q4 is one of the lowest in the last 15 years, right? And I appreciate I mean both of us have been in this industry for a long time, and these are unprecedented times, but this is sort of lowest \u2013 one of the lowest ramps that we've seen in many, many years. And then the third is customer conversations, right? So we're talking to customers. I'm spending a lot of time with them, and it's clear that we are seeing, I would say, asynchronous good execution in pharma. That gives us the confidence to sort of say, okay, Q4 is going to be like we have projected. And we have \u2013 that's why we have \u2013 and largely because of the uncertainty, we have ranged the Q4 guide wider than we have in the past, right? So I appreciate your question and appreciate the historical context. We took a lot of the facts into account in guiding wider than we have in the past. And as I said, look, new products, great execution with the hand that we have, I think we're doing extremely, extremely well, especially outside the U.S. Amol, anything else to add on the guide? Thank you, Derik. And then Rachel, just one last comment on Q3 and the ramp to Q4. I mean, the trends we are seeing in Q3, what gives us confidence, especially in pharma and with mass spec, with LC, that they'll persist is we saw exactly the same thing in Q2. And I think we probably had the same discussion, why are we seeing better performance in pharma than the peer group? Why are we seeing LCs sort of flatten out? It's the same reasoning and we're seeing the same customer feedback. So I think it's reasonable to project that into Q4. Thanks for the question, Eve. I'll start with the Wyatt question. Look, I mean, we're very pleased with the way the integration is going. I mean, that should be the general takeaway and you can see that in the facts, right, basically a 4% contribution this quarter and 2.5% for the year. So we think we are going to deliver that. And when you look at the drivers, the integration is growing faster than we had initially even imagined. There are exactly the same headwinds. The funnel velocities are longer. It is taking more time for customers to place orders. But number one, given the larger commercial field force that Waters had, we were able to use that to generate a lot more leads for our light scattering instruments from Wyatt, which are highly differentiated in the market. So as we got more leads, we got more conversions and the funnels moving nicely through. Second, we've spent a lot of time in making it easier for customers to connect Waters as LCs to multi-angle light scattering instruments from Wyatt, and that's well ahead of target. And third, we had talked earlier when we talked about the synergy contributions, we had talked about columns from Waters being substituted for other competitors columns and that's gone extremely well. So every light scattering equipment that is sold now is sold with a Waters SEC column, which are the best-in-class. So integration going very well, but the largest driver, I would say, of short-term results and overcoming the obvious headwinds is the larger number of leads that are Waters account managers have provided the Wyatt specialists. And as you look ahead, I mean, really optimistic about what we are seeing with the collaboration across the two organizations. Our Wyatt colleagues were present at the Innovation Summit recently, which basically invites over 300 or so R&D scientists around the globe for a hybrid session. We had many posters from Wyatt colleagues looking at collaborations across the organization. So I'm extremely pleased with where things are going. And we recently launched the ZetaStar, which combines three light scattering technologies into one. So Wyatt's going extremely well, and thank you for the opportunity to expound on that. Now, on the high growth adjacencies, the 30.5% operating margin that we are committing to for the full year includes the 70 to 80 basis points that we had said that we would invest, we had started to invest that early in the year. We are seeing very nice outcomes of that, especially in our clinical business where the team has developed many, many assays, simplified workflows for difficult to do experiments with LCMS and making it a much more easier experiment for customers who want to use LCMS in specialty diagnostics areas like for Alzheimer's testing \u2013 like for testing antibodies for Alzheimer's as just a case in point. So the high growth adjacencies are delivering. Now we will look at the net picture as we look at the full year and how it lands and we will talk about how we're going to invest and continue to invest in the high growth adjacencies as we give guidance at the beginning of next year. Yes. So service attachment rates \u2013 So Catherine, thank you for the question. Service attachment rates are well ahead of target. You'll remember that we committed to 100 basis points of increase in attachment rates. We're well ahead of that. So we'll likely exit the year with 200 basis points of increase in service attachment rates. And you would see that in the growth that is being seen, especially outside of China for service, which is basically high single digit growth for year-to-date and the balance of the year. So service is going quite well. On e-commerce as well, we've gone from about 20%, 25% of products going through e-commerce to well in excess of 30%, closer to 35% now that the team is highly focused on that. I mean, as you can imagine, given the slowdown in the overall market, our Chemistry portfolio has still done pretty well and the Chemistry portfolio is benefiting from additional products going through e-commerce. So Chemistry is currently growing high single digits and benefiting from the additional focus on e-commerce. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in Waters. A replay of this call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at future events and conferences."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, sales grew less than 1% as reported. Organic constant currency sales declined 4% against a mid-teens growth comparison last year. Waters Division and TA both declined 4%. We saw good results again from our Wyatt acquisition, which added 4% constant currency growth and perform in line with our expectations despite the challenging environment. The impact of FX was flat in the quarter, which came in below our expectations of a 1% tailwind to as reported sales. In organic constant currency by end market, pharma declined 2%, industrial declined 8%, and academic and government declined 3%. In pharma, mid-single-digit positive growth outside of China was more than offset by continued slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 30%. In industrial, our business declined high single digits with a tough growth comparison of 22% in the prior year quarter, and due to China weakness now spilling over into non-pharma segments. We continued to see strong growth in global PFAS testing and battery testing applications. Academic and government declined 3%. Outside of China, overall A&G growth was up 8%. This was led by double-digit growth in Europe and mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. In China, A&G declined over 30% as demand fell rapidly after we completed shipments under the stimulus program in the first half of the year. By geography, sales in Asia declined 12%, the Americas was flat and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China broadly declined. Excluding China, Asia grew 3%, which was in line with our expectations. India grew low double digits and Japan grew mid-teens. In Americas, pharma grew 6%, which exceeded our expectations as we executed very well with our large to mid pharma customers. Academic and government also grew 6%. However, strength in these two segments was offset by contraction in industrial for the quarter. In Europe, growth exceeded our expectations in pharma, which grew mid-single-digits, and academic and government, which grew 10%, while industrial decline mid-single-digits. By products and segments, instruments declined 13%. Recurring revenues grew mid-single-digits overall and high single digits outside of China. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year's quarter. Our continued focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment, together with lower incentive compensation drove continued margin expansion. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.1%, an expansion of 240 basis points compared to 56.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was approximately 31.5%, an expansion of 380 basis points compared to 27.7% in the third quarter of 2022. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.7% due to discrete items within the quarter. The average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 800,000 less than the third quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.84, an increase of 8% despite flat revenue. On GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share were $2.27. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment, and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and exclude special items. In the third quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $123 million, after funding $38 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow was impacted by higher inventory balances. We maintain a strong balance sheet access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of third quarter, our net debt position further declined to $2.2 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.2. This represents a decrease of $125 million during the quarter, as we deal [ph] with the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down the debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition. We will evaluate resumption of our share repurchase program through the quarter and into the first half of next year. Now, I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, growth rates in China have continued to deteriorate as the year has progressed. In addition, weakness in China has now broadened beyond pharma and into industrial and academic and government end markets. We expect China growth rates to sequentially decline further in the fourth quarter and now expect China to decline approximately 25% for the full year versus our prior expectations of low double digit decline. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 250 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guidance to the range between negative 2% and negative 1%. At current exchange rates where the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most major currencies since our last earnings call, currency translation is now expected to have a 1.5% negative impact on our full year sales, which is a 150 basis points headwind versus our prior guide. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now negative 1% to flat. As Udit covered despite incremental headwinds from China and FX, our teams have rallied to drive pricing and productivity gains. We expect this will allow us to deliver a gross margin of approximately 59% for the year, which is in line with our previous guidance and is a 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. Together with proactive cost alignment, we expect this will allow us to deliver an adjusted operating margin of approximately 30.5% for the year after funding investments in high growth adjacencies, which is also in line with our previous guide and it's 30 basis points of expansion versus last year, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59.2 million shares. Our rolling all this together on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.65 to $11.75, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3.5 percentage points at current FX rates. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect further weakness in China and cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect fourth quarter organic constant currency sales growth in the range of negative 8% to negative 5%. At today's rates currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. While we expect Wyatt to add approximately 3.5% to our fourth quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6% to negative 3%. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.62, which includes a negative impact from currency of approximately five percentage points at current FX rates. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. Hey, Vijay. Good morning. Look, Vijay, I mean, on the Q3 to Q4 ramp, if you look at our last five years, we averaged roughly a 24% ramp from Q3 to Q4. And where our guide is roughly 13% to 17% ramp from Q3 to Q4. So clearly it's fairly muted compared to historical levels. Also, if you look at last 15 years, there've been just a couple of years in those years, which have come in towards the bottom end of our guide. So that's why, we feel, generally we've muted the ramp from Q3 to Q4. Also, Q3 baseline, which is in this ramp, reflects sort of the slower approval cycles that have been playing out throughout the year. And there's about one extra day in Q4 this year versus the previous year. And then the last piece is, I mean, it's based on the fact that yes, there is pain in China at this point. But then when we look at pharma in the U.S., in Europe, in Japan, in India, especially mid to large pharma, our teams are doing a great job there and driving decent outcomes. Yes. Just to sort of touch on your other question. Look, I mean, pharma overall declined low single digits for us in Q3. And then for Q4, what is embedded in the guide is sort of a mid-single digit decline. Obviously that includes China. When you strip China out for the rest of the markets, the rest of the markets grew a little under mid-single digits in Q3. And then in Q4, we are expecting them to still grow, but not at the same level in Q3, a little bit less than what they grew in Q3. Yes. So, Matt, good morning, and thanks for your question. Look, I mean, ever since we went through the inflationary cycle last year, that gave us opportunity to put good systems and processes around pricing. And if you look at Waters' history, traditionally we've done 50 basis points to 75 basis points. And last year was very different. And our teams have continued to execute on that sort of system and process pathway. So we started the year with about little over 200 basis points and it's only got stronger as we came into Q3 with little over 250 basis points. And then we expect something similar in Q4, which then for the full year, we will be little over 250 basis points. And that's sort of driving a third of our operating margin expansion for the quarter. Yes. So, Derik, thanks for your question. I mean as we had discussed in our last earnings call, right, where we had to make some tough but necessary decisions to reduce our workforce by about 5%. And we did that at the beginning of Q3, and that resulted in approximately $10 million of savings in Q3 that is in our Q3 results. We expect for 2023, roughly $20 million. So another $10 million in Q4. And the annualized impact, which will play out next year would be about $40 million. Again, we may invest some of it to fund some of the high growth adjacencies, but before that annualized, its $40 million. And we incurred about $27 million associated with severance expenses for this restructuring, which is in our GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment. Now, keep in mind, in Q3, the way it sort of played out is we had lower volume on our organic business, so we lost some volume leverage. And so, essentially, the reduction in AIP plus the accretion for Wyatt more or less offsetted the lack of volume leverage from the underlying business. And then the three factors which are pricing, these cost actions that I just talked about, and then the underlying productivity initiatives playing out on freight and procurement and the capability center, they each contributed roughly a third of the 380 basis points. No, no, I think you covered it. Yes. I mean, look, if you sort of see how the year has played out, we did see funnel velocity slow down across all the trade classes, especially pharma in Q1. And then as we've gone through Q2 and Q3, the funnel velocity has sort of stayed where it is at a higher level. So it's taking more time for people to approve these orders. And we expect that to continue through Q4. What we haven't seen in pharma, which is good, is we haven't seen projects getting canceled. And so opportunities are landing, they're just taking more time to land. And in terms of sort of sales versus orders, I mean, they're going hand in hand. It's not that we are meaningfully drawing down backlog in any quarter or the whole. The one place where the trajectory has changed somewhat is in the industrial trade class. And this is all outside of China I'm talking about. And there, while the funnel velocity had progressively slowed in Q1 and Q2, we hadn't seen any opportunities getting canceled. And what we are seeing in Q3 is and again, don't confuse this with orders. No customers are canceling orders. But when the opportunity is in the CRM system, from lead gen to conversion, we are seeing elevated levels of projects getting canceled for lack of funding or funding not available in the current year, particularly in testing labs. And that we saw sort of emerge in Q3. And then China, I mean, we've sort of covered that before, which is a different story, much more painful. That started in Q1 with tier 1 CDMOs and then sort of progressively went into tier 2, tier 3 CDMOs and biotechs with investor funding and then played out in branded generics with VBP and anticorruption drives, which haven't bottomed yet and then has spilled over into the industrial and A&G, especially as the stimulus money is done for A&G. Yes. I mean, look, if you look at how we've performed in adversity, like last year, there was tremendous inflationary pressure and dollar kept becoming stronger and stronger, right. And despite all of that, our teams rallied to find pricing gains and productivity gains and sort of land a margin equal or better than the prior year. And then this year, again, we've sort of gone through demand challenges and then also further strengthening of U.S. dollar. And despite that, we found ways to defend margin through pricing, through productivity, through cost alignment. So we really feel good about how our teams have responded in these situations. Now, as you look at 2024, I mean, as Udit outlined, right, it's a little early because we want to see how the next two months play out. They are a big part of our year. We are also just rolling up our bottoms up AOP, and we want to sort of review that before we sort of talk about 2024. So like we always do at our Q4 earnings call, we will provide more details and guidance for 2024."

Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key messages for the quarter. Then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar and good morning everyone. Before diving into the results, I would like to start by saying that I'm very proud of how our teams have executed this quarter. We delivered a solid performance across our end markets despite a challenging environment and a stronger-than-expected slowdown in China. Our revitalized portfolio is driving results in areas of high unmet need as our newly launched products continue to gain traction and we're well-positioned for future growth as we make meaningful progress and make further investment in our high-growth adjacencies. Turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered at the high end of our guidance with 3% organic constant currency growth. We also had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which performed ahead of expectations and contributed 2% growth for the quarter. Overall, constant currency growth was 5% and our as-reported growth was 4%. Our organic constant currency performance was led by strong growth in the Industrial segment, which grew low double-digits and the academic and government segment, which grew over 20%. In both of these end markets, mass spec grew over 40%, as our revitalized portfolio saw continued strong demand. In the pharma segment, which declined 4%, both the US and Europe grew high single-digits, showing initial signs of recovery in pharma spend. However, this was more than offset by significant worsening in the China pharma market as weakness broadened beyond CDMOs. The weakness in China also impacted our instrument growth, which declined 2% in the quarter. When excluding China, instrument growth was 8%, led by mid-teens instrument growth in the US and low double-digit growth in Europe. Meanwhile, our recurring revenue grew high single-digits, driven by increased service plan attachment and chemical e-commerce adoption. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in above our expectations at $2.80, driven by operational excellence across pricing and procurement as well as our cost actions. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares were $2.55. Despite the challenging macro conditions, our commercial execution remains strong. So far this year within instruments, mass spec has grown high-teens on both a year-over-year and two-year stack basis as our commercial teams have capitalized on the strength of our renewed product portfolio. Our TA instruments division has also seen strong results despite macro challenges, having grown low double-digits year-over-year and on a two-year stack basis. Our commercial initiatives and strong execution have enabled high single-digit growth in recurring revenue. We have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points in 2023. We're now targeting an additional 100 basis points of expansion over the remainder of the year. The strength of our execution and the quality of our service offering is helping us drive this growth, and there is further runway ahead. Price is also a key part of our execution where we built commercial muscle and discipline in recent years. We've achieved strong results in price over 200 basis points so far this year. With our operational excellence, we expect to meaningfully expand our margins this year. For the first half of 2023, our gross margin is 58.9%, which is an expansion of 110 basis points versus the first half of 2022  For the full year, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59%, which is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. We also expect to deliver an operating margin of 30.5% this year, which is 30 basis points higher than last year. Our revitalized portfolio is also driving results in areas of high unmet need. I would like to share a few specific examples. First, in the industrial segment, we're seeing strong growth in PFAS testing, and we are towards the beginning of a multiyear growth opportunity. Our growth in PFAS testing is twice as fast as the 20% estimated market growth rate as we continue to take share with our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. In the academic and government segment, our high-res mass spec portfolio is seeing strong adoption at a time where global funding for R&D applications continues to be elevated. Select Series MRT is unique in the high-res mass spec market due to its enhanced resolution at high speeds, which gives it unique capabilities for metabolomics and imaging applications where throughput requirements are high.\\ At ASMS recently, we announced new enhancements for the MRT, which increases imaging resolution by 50% and boost sample throughput even further. Earlier this year, we launched Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade. We've continued to see strong interest in its launch and several customers have already made plans to replace their LCs with this new industry leading platform. We now have not one but two new industry-leading LCs for QA/QC applications in pharma, Alliance iS and Arc HPLC. Both of these instruments answer significant unmet needs in the market, which continue to drive long-term growth in instrument replacement. And in our TA division, new product launches such as powder reology accessory and the battery cycle microcalimeter have supported growth in battery testing for electric vehicles. Battery testing is a fast growing market, and we are well-positioned to support demand for characterization that will lead to safer and better performing batteries. The strong results we've achieved in growing markets like batteries have allowed us to deliver double-digit growth in TA so far this year despite the challenging environment. We remain well-positioned for future growth and the long-term fundamentals of our business have never been better. While instruments are always prone to short-term fluctuations in spending patterns, instrument growth has been highly resilient on a long-term basis with average growth of about 5%. As we look ahead, the demand profile for our instruments has only strengthened versus this historical trend. Total global prescription drug sales, which is a key driver of instrument volume growth are expected to exceed historical growth rates for the foreseeable future. And our potential is further enhanced by the measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain 100 to 200 basis points improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development and process optimization of large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for our business. Here, novel modalities require more advanced characterization techniques like mass spec and light scattering that have not been used in the past. We believe that this trend will not only continue, but will also pave the way for adoption of analytical instruments in high-volume, recurring applications and large molecule manufacturing. We expect this to occur as they become embedded within process control, QA/QC and raw material testing over time. We remain focused on nurturing this growth opportunity with our continued investment in bioanalytical characterization and bio separations. In bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate, we've been investing both organically and inorganically. We recently closed the acquisition of Wyatt, which expands our ability to characterize large molecules across various stages of production beyond that of what we can do with LC-UV and LC mass spec alone. We also recently announced an expansion in our collaboration with Sartorius from upstream development into downstream manufacturing. So far, in upstream process development, we've demonstrated that bearing BioAccord Arc line with the Sartorius Ambr 15 and 250 bioreactors has enabled bioprocess engineers to accelerate clone selection results from weeks to a matter of hours. Now our expanded collaboration will integrate our technologies further. We will develop analytical solutions that are in line and offer real-time monitoring of process controls and critical quality attributes in the bioreactor. By offering bioprocess engineers access to comprehensive analytical data for downstream batch and continuous manufacturing, we can support improved yields while reducing waste and lowering biomanufacturing costs. Finally, in Bioseparations, which is a $1.4 billion total addressable market with an 8% to 10% projected annual growth rate, we recently announced a multi-year research collaboration with Princeton University. The goal of this partnership is to advance research and drug discovery and development using novel bioseparation techniques that we're developing for large complex biomolecules. We also just introduced our first release in the new line of size exclusion chromatography columns, which are designed for the separation and analysis of viral vectors in applications such as gene therapy. Our new XBridge Premier GTx BEH SEC columns reduced the cost of gene therapies by using 3 to 10 times less sample than other methods, while generating faster results and providing more drug substance information. They can measure aggregation, titer and low molecular weight impurities at twice the speed of existing column at 50% greater resolution. The combination of these columns with wired multi-angle light scattering will deepen the level of information that can be acquired from a single experiment. This will accelerate development times of modalities such as adeno-associated viruses or AAV and allow for more optimized manufacturing, which can reduce costs. Turning now to our updated 2023 guidance. The slowdown in the pharma end market in China has progressed beyond CDMOs resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low digit -- low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Our guide does not assume any benefit from a new round of stimulus in the second half of the year. While our funnel remains healthy, we also continue to see slower than usual funnel velocity from customers more broadly. Assuming that, this trend continues through the rest of the year, we expect this to translate to a full year growth headwind of approximately 100 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Despite our lower revenue guide, we are proactively managing our cost and productivity while continuing to preserve our investments in future growth. In July, we made some very difficult but necessary decisions to realign the workforce in our core business, which impacted just under 5% of our employees. These actions allow us to better align our resources with our growth strategy and offset the incremental demand weakness that I just described. This, together with our focus on operational excellence across pricing and procurement is expected to deliver a gross margin of 59% this year, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2022. We also expect to expand our operating margin approximate to approximately 30.5%, which is an increase of 30 basis points versus 2022. These actions allow us to mitigate EPS headwind from lower expected revenue, resulting in our updated full year EPS guidance of $12.20 to $12.30. Now, I will pass the call to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales grew 4% as reported. Organic constant currency sales grew 3% as Waters division grew 2% and TA grew 11%. We had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which exceeded our expectations and added 2% constant currency sales growth. FX was a 1% headwind in the quarter. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 11% and academic and government grew over 20%. In pharma, high single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, was more than offset by a pronounced slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 40%. In industrial, Waters Division and TA both grew low double digits with broad strength across all regions. In our Water business, strength was led by food and environmental testing where we saw continued strong growth in global PFAS testing applications driven by our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spectrometer. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and microcalorimetry. We again saw strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronics testing, which more than offset weakness in more cyclical revenues from materials and chemicals. In academic and government, there was continued strong demand in upstream applications from our refreshed mass spec portfolio supported by elevated funding levels across the globe. Mass spec sales more than doubled in the U.S., grew approximately 50% in Europe and grew 30% in Asia. By product, strength was led by our high-res mass spec portfolio with applications in metabolomics and spatial biology, resulting in strong growth for cyclic IMS and Select Series MRT. Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 5%, the Americas grew 7% and Europe grew 9%. In Asia, China declined high-teens. Excluding China, Asia grew 6%, with India growing high single digits and Japan growing mid single digits. In the Americas, pharma grew 6%, led by 7% growth in the U.S., industrial grew 3% and academic and government grew almost 30%. In Europe, pharma grew 7%, industrial grew 6% and academic and government grew over 35%. In both Americas and Europe, these results reflect two-year stacked growth of high single digits or above across each of the end markets. By products and services, instrument declined 2% overall as mass spec growth of almost 20% and double-digit growth in TA Instrument Systems was more than offset by China pharma demand weakness led by LC. Recurring revenues grew high single digits. Chemistry growth was supported by continued strength in MaxPeak Premier columns, which grew over 50% in the quarter. Service growth continues to be supported by strong pull-through from recent instrument sales and increasing service plan attachment, which has already increased by another 100 basis points in the first half of the year. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.3%, an expansion of 230 basis points compared to 57% in the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 29.6%, an expansion of 120 basis points compared to 28.4% in the second quarter of 2022. Our margin expansion was driven by strong operational performance with pricing gains, lower material and freight costs as well as prudent management of spend. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Average share count came in at 59 million shares, which is about 1.5 million less than the second quarter of last year. On non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.80. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.55. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $73 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is impacted by higher inventory balances, timing of income tax payments and wire transaction expenses. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out, attractive adjacent markets. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $2.3 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3. This represents an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter, which is related primarily to the Wyatt acquisition. As we previously disclosed, we have temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year to use our free cash flow to delever the acquisition. Now I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, the slowdown in China pharma has progressed beyond CDMOs, resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Additionally, while our funnel remains strong, we are observing longer capital purchasing approval cycles amongst our customers broadly due to spending caution in the current environment. We expect these dynamics to continue through the rest of the year and contribute an additional 100 basis points full year growth headwind versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guide to 0.5% to 1.5%, which translates to a 2-year stack growth of approximately 6% to 6.5%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on the full year sales. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect wire transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 3% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59% for the year, which is 100 basis points expansion versus last year and is higher than our previous guide. We expect operating margin to be approximately 30.5%, which translates to 30 basis points of margin expansion versus last year. Cost actions in our core business are expected to deliver approximately $45 million in annualized savings and are expected to contribute $20 million in 2023, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We will progressively redeploy part of these savings to resource our growth strategy and to expand capacity on high-growth end market opportunities. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59 million, given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $12.20 to $12.30, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at the current FX rates. Looking to the third quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China. We also expect cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect third quarter organic constant currency sales growth of negative 4% to negative 2%, which translates to two-year stacked growth of approximately 5.5% at midpoint, given the mid-teens comp from last year. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1% and we expect to Wyatt to add 4% to our third quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total third quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1% to 3%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with a neutral currency impact. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. Even through challenging times in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to come together as an organization to ensure we leave this world better than we found it. With our vibrant employee circles, we recently celebrated Pride Month as well as our Fantastic Women in Engineering. We also kicked off our third year of Water Student Academy, a summer program for high school students from underserved communities who are interested in exploring a career in science. We're also very proud recognized as one of US News & World Report Best Companies to Work For. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone line to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We would now open the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a pretty impressive second quarter print here. Udit, my first one for you, mass spec was the star 19%. What is the mass spec CAGR here on a pre-pandemic 2019 basis? Could you just comment on orders and backlog? Would it be presuming for instrumentation and outlook here as you look at the back half?\nUdit Batra: Thank you for your question Vijay and good morning. Firstly, on mass spec. Over the long-term, so over two years -- just to answer your question, over the two-year CAGR is in the high teens, the four-year CAGR is in the high single-digits to double-digits. The story with mass-spec, Vijay, is twofold. One is of execution and the other one is of the traction of our new products. On the new products, we launched the Xevo TQ Absolute, which meets significant unmet needs in the PFAS area where we're growing double the rate of the market. I think we've heard the market grows roughly 20%. We're growing double that rate. In that particular market, our mass spec instruments are seeing terrific, terrific traction in the high-risk space where there's additional funding that academic institutions have. And as you move to the biologics area and bioprocessing our LCMS tools like the BioAccord and the enhanced workflows that we've developed are gaining traction. So if you compare our 20% print in this quarter or year-to-date or even versus last year on stacked, it compares very favorably to some of the peers who -- some of the mass spec heavy peers who have already reported their results. So we feel very good that we're gaining share in this market. And mass spec goes from strength to strength. And to your question now on overall instruments, look, take a step back and when you look at the overall instrument performance for this quarter, it's roughly two -- roughly negative 2%. Now this is an illustration of two things: one, strong execution and traction of innovation in the US and Europe and, of course, additional weakness in China. Let me comment on both. Starting with US and Europe, instrument growth rate in the United States was roughly 15%. Europe was 11%. And China, of course, declined close to 25% for the quarter for overall instruments. Now if you look at it from a portfolio perspective, we've already discussed mass spec. Mass spec to 20%. TA continued to grow double-digit in this quarter, and this is basically meeting unmet needs in the battery segment and several other segments in addition to strong execution. You move to LC. And again, let me double quick on this to illustrate my point on execution and a bit of recovery that we're seeing in US and Europe. Whereas in China, we saw LC get significantly worse, minus 40-ish percent growth. In the US and in Europe, we started to see growth again basically 4% -- 3%, 4% growth in both of those geographies. And you'll recall, in the first quarter call, we talked about our conversations with several for large pharma customers, and I have personally spoken to them. And the quality of the orders that we saw from an instrument perspective was terrific. It was just that the funnel velocity was lower, right? So the funnel velocity is still lower, and that's the assumption for the back half of the year. But we are seeing those orders -- we saw those orders come through this quarter. In fact, we won several competitive bids with -- give you an example of one of the largest GLP-1 manufacturers, this is the anti-obesity drug, where we won a competitive bid and our UPLCs are going to be not just with the originator, but also with all the CDMOs who are going to manufacture this product. And the same thing is true for columns. So instrument growth rate has been -- again, it's a tale of two sort of stories where US and Europe are seeing a nice recovery, good execution, great traction of new products and a little bit of lack of visibility in China, especially in pharma. And then I think finally, in the prepared remarks, we showed you the long-term growth rate of instruments, roughly 5-ish percent CAGR with a 60-ish percent gross margin and the low SG&A, I mean, I'll take that business any day. Now if you compare it to historical trends, we see additional vectors for growth. Pricing is better than we've seen in the past by 100 to 200 basis points. We see prescription growth rates are going up, which is the single largest driver for growth of LCs, and we see additional users, especially in large pharma, environmental and food testing. So I hope that gives you a picture of our mass spec as well as our instrument growth rate and why we are positive about that business.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Udit. Amol, one for you. When I look at the third quarter guidance versus fourth quarter implied there's a pretty big sequential step up in Q4, both on the organic and even more impressive on the EPS line. Maybe just talk about the fourth quarter implied assumptions here. What's driving the sequential strength?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, a couple of things there, Vijay, right. I mean the step up on the growth is purely related to the baselining. So, if you look at it on a two-year or a four-year stacked basis, Q3 and Q4 guide is pretty consistent. So, on a four-year stack basis, both Q3 and Q4 are growing 6%. Two, if you sort of look at the ramp-up in dollar million sales. I mean we typically do 24% of our full year revenue in Q3 and about 30% in Q4. And so the guide is sort of consistent with that, with sort of tad caution on Q3. And so that's sort of consistent with the past. And it also sort of accounts for the fact that whatever we see in Q3 in terms of China slowdown and cautious spending with pharma will continue into Q4. And then as you look into Q4 EPS, you see a steep ramp versus last year of about 15% growth, but again, there are various factors that are contributing to it. I mean as Udit outlined, we've taken cost actions and a predominant portion of those cost action savings will show up in Q4. That, coupled with productivity gains that our teams have managed across pricing, across materials and freight, across other areas of procurement, those two things together, we get about 5% of that growth coming from the cost actions, another 3% to 4% of that growth coming out of productivity. So, that's the big portion of the 15% increase that you see in the EPS in Q4. The rest is there is 3% FX benefit. Wyatt is normal dilutive in Q4, so there is a net neutral impact there. And then there is the lower share count, about 1.5% underlying sales growth.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Luke Sergott from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLuke Sergott: Awesome. Thanks. I guess, can we just dig in here from the drivers of the guide for the full year and for the remaining back half? And if you guys have any further deterioration in any of the markets baked in?\nUdit Batra: So, I'll start, and then I'll let Amol comment, Luke. Thank you for the question. I mean just starting with the second quarter first and how that plays out for the balance of the year, right? I mean in the second quarter, you saw roughly 3% growth. And it's sort of different in the US, Europe and China, right? In US and Europe, we see roughly 7%-ish growth and in China, we see continued decline of close to mid-teens. And as you now look at the balance of the year, we are starting to see a bit of a recovery, both in US and Europe. And I commented earlier to Vijay's question also on what we saw on instruments. But where we sit right now, we feel China has deteriorated further and there's a bit of lack of visibility. What we saw with CDMOs has now permeated into the rest of the pharma industry. So, we've decreased our guide overall by 300 basis points, 200 basis points of that is additional China slowdown. And we -- while the orders are very strong, while the execution is extremely strong in -- across the globe, new products are gaining traction. We think the funnel velocity has been slower towards the end of Q2, and we've used that projection for the balance of the year. So we've taken down the guide an additional 100 basis. So that's a 300 basis point drop versus what we told you in Q1 on the top line. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. And I mean if you sort of go through the individual components, right, China, as we said, is a low double-digit growth for the full year. It's slightly more elevated in the second half versus the first half in our guide assumptions. Rest of the world in the first half grew mid-single digits. The assumption for the second half is low single-digits. LC sort of grew mid-teens decline in the first half, and that's sort of also our second half assumption versus mass spec and TA. Just given the situation, and we've reduced it to sort of low to mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year. So as you see, I mean, we've sort of risk-adjusted a big portion of our second half of the year given what's playing out in the market.\nLuke Sergott: All right. And then you guys have been operating in China for a while. You have a lot of history there. Can you just give us a sense of the -- how quickly the various end markets can bounce back? Like what you've seen in the past? And what you're hearing from the boots on the street over there?\nUdit Batra: Luke, that's a good question. And I don't think you'll hear us saying a lot different than what you've heard from many of our peers, right? In the long-term, China is a terrific growth market, we all know, right? And you've seen that through the history. But we saw in the second quarter a mid-teens decline in China. CDMOs got worse and people are just cautious, super cautious in spending in our pharma customers, across the traditional Chinese medicine customers, you see that permeating across the board. And it's not clear when that opens up. So we've assumed that for the full year, China is going to decline low to mid-double digits. Now when you look at -- and we've also not assumed that another stimulus is coming to grow the ANG market, and we've seen pretty dynamic growth for the first half of the year, that was driven by the stimulus that came late last year, and we've assumed that there's no stimulus coming for the balance of the year until we have clear visibility. So you've seen we've been very careful and cautious, but there's not a heck of a lot of visibility. What I'd like to remind you, though, from a Waters-specific case from 2016 to 2020, whenever Waters grew and whenever Waters growth rate fell, it was all correlated to China. This is very different now. We see that the US and Europe 2020, 2021 and now also 2022 and 2023, we seen US and Europe grow and contribute to growth really, really well in addition to China. So we feel that the business is very nicely diversified, and we see that we have growth in other geographies. And I'll conclude by saying China remains a dynamic market. Our teams have visited four to five times. The global teams have visited four to five times since the last time we spoke. And on the ground, you see incredible, incredible collaboration with our customers. You see, especially in the batteries market, China is well advanced of US and Europe, and we think the adoption for our TA products is going to grow much faster in China. If you go to the specialty diagnostics arena, China again, has been a front runner in adoption of mass spec in the clinical space, and we are working with several collaborators there to introduce our high-end mass specs in that workflow. And it's a matter of time that China will recover. We feel we are very well positioned to capitalize on it when it does. But in the short-term, you will not hear us say anything different about the visibility for the balance of the year than what you've already heard.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks. Solid quarter. So, question would be on the guidance, I think. I think the question we'll probably get is after solid Q2 kind of is the guide derisked enough and it kind of makes it more difficult to parse out the super lead China and obviously, Europe and US doing better than I think we expected. So, can you just speak to a little bit again? I know you've given some color already and the comps make it difficult to kind of get a trend line here. But like how should we think about the extent of maybe a cushion that's kind of assumed in the back half of the year or just kind of the confidence in the back half of your guide?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, Dan, look, I mean we looked at how things have progressed through Q2. And if you look at the regions, even outside China, we have meaningfully reduce our outlook for those regions. As I said before, those regions grew mid-single-digits. Outside China, we are now estimating low single-digits. Instruments declined low single-digits. We are assuming for the second half, it will decline mid-single-digits as growth normalizes for mass spec and TA. Even recurring revenues, we've sort of stepped them down from mid to high single-digits to mid-single-digits for the second half. And we sort of assumed A&G and industrial normalize in the second half of the year. Now, based on those assumptions, we think it's reasonable given how things are playing out, I think the one wildcard still remains how out of China plays out in Q3 and Q4 because we know China goes down fast, but it also comes back fast. We haven't assumed any second half China stimulus in our number. So, if that comes, it will be an upside. But otherwise, we feel comfortable where our guide is for Q3 and for the second half.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. And then maybe a I think US and EU pharma results here look really solid. I guess it's a little different in the early start of Q2 earnings season from peers that have kind of been talking now for the more. Just again, the business mix to currently make it difficult if you like direct read process. But do you think you guys are gaining share as related to maybe different business making comps? And then kind of what's assumed at the back half of the year for the US and European pharma? Thanks.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So, I mean, Dan, look, I mean our teams in US and Europe see an exceedingly great job in Q2. Our win rates were up. They positively surprised us with great outcomes with the level of growth that they manage, right? As we look into the second half for those teams, right now, we've sort of tapered the guidance down to low single-digit growth in those regions. But the way our teams are executing in these markets gives us great confidence that they will be able to do a great job in these markets as things start to come back.\nUdit Batra: Yes. And Dan, your line was breaking up a little bit. If I understand the question, you wanted a bit more color on pharma. And I guess you could ask, hey, you're seeing good trends in pharma or at least some recovery in both US and Europe. And recall that we talked about this in Q1, where we said we had conversations with large pharma players, and it was not a question of what, it was just a question of when they would place orders and some of those orders came through in Q2 and some fairly significant orders, right? I mentioned GLP-1 agonist. We are the UPLC of choice for a very large pharma manufacturer. In fact, both of them who are making GLP-1s columns replaced -- in our competitors' column, which is a rare, rare thing that happens in the industry because the customer said they wanted full end-to-end visibility on the supply chain. We are the only player in the industry who manufactures our own particles, our own columns, full end-to-end, and that gives us significant strength, right? So we saw share gain in pharma. We saw new products gaining traction in the bioprocessing arena. And you would have seen that we've just launched a column that is specifically targeted towards separating Adeno-Associated Virus. These are viral vectors used for set of gene therapy. And it brings me great pleasure to say that these are columns that are attached to our mouse [ph] instruments. So we are really executing well in pharma, wherever we have ability to access our customers and customers are purchasing. And new products are gaining traction. So for the second half of the year, we've just said, look, let's not just use one data point to extrapolate. We're looking for more data points, even in US and Europe, and we will gain even more confidence. But from where I sit today, I see excellent execution, excellent new product traction both in US and in Europe. And in China, like I said before, our visibility is just as much as others. And when China recovers, we'll execute like we're executing in U.S. and in Europe.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Just out of curiosity, how much backlog work down left over stimulus spending did you see in Q2? And just sort of like what were orders coming through and what was sort of like -- was anything worked down as you have any backlog that got pushed?\nUdit Batra: So Derik, thanks for the question. We saw very modest drawdown in backlog orders were largely in line with sales for the quarter, and we see the same thing happening for the full year. That's the same assumption. So again, an indicator that says, like to the previous question, indicator that says that, look, trends are improving, especially in the US and in Europe for our large pharma customers and other customers. But yes, in this quarter, basically very modest single digit -- low single-digit million drawdown of backlog and the same assumption for the balance of the year.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. On the academic market, just out of curiosity, are you doing -- are you seeing any pull forward in spending? I mean, obviously, there's some worries about budgets and things. Are you seeing any sort of pull forward your customers they look?\nUdit Batra: Derik, as a former academic myself, I can tell you we spend when we get the money. And when you get money like we like the academician are getting now, my old professors, my own colleagues, they spend as soon as they get it, right? So it pull forward or is it catch up, you cannot tell. It's a very -- it's a very volatile market. It goes up dramatically. It goes down dramatically. And it is correlated to only one thing, stimulus. And it is correlated to only one thing, stimulus. And you see stimulus coming across the globe. And what we've seen is dynamic growth in the US and Europe. And again, our mass spec portfolio -- the high res mass spec portfolio, our UPLC, our columns have done extremely, extremely well in this market around the globe, and we've won competitive bids across the board. So, I feel very good about our portfolio in that market, although it's a volatile market, it correlates very heavily with funding. I don't think it is catch up or pull forward. It is just opportunistic. When it comes, professors have money, and they buy. And I've done that myself as a previous academician.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just the first one on Wyatt, just the -- it's obviously outperforming your sort of initial expectations. Maybe talk about some of the drivers that you're seeing that's contributing to that outperformance? And you had mentioned when you had talked about the synergies at Wyatt that you would start shipping Waters columns with Wyatt. And I think previously, they were non-Waters column shipping. Is that part of the dynamic, or is it just too early? Is it more about further penetrating the markets and driving sort of organic growth with the instruments?\nUdit Batra: Matt, thank you for the question. You know that we closed the deal in this quarter. And really three drivers and we've talked about them in our previous discussions, and they're all contributing, right? The first one is column attachment to malls instruments, and this has gone as planned. Our columns are being shipped with the instruments as we speak. Second, in the column space itself, we've launched columns that are custom-made for solving problems for our customers, and in this case, our most recent X Bridge GTX column that we just launched and this is -- basically this was announced yesterday, but it's starting to ship now. There -- it speeds up measurements by over 50%, reduces sample size by 30% to a 100%. And that basically saves our customers a lot of samples. So, those -- that's already happening. Second, we have talked about lead generation. There are significant hundreds of leads that are -- that have been generated in -- especially in the US and in Europe, where there's a lot of access to our customers. And as emerging biotech and precommercial biotech starts to especially in the US, we're seeing the lead generation pick up quite dramatically and some of those leads have already been converted into sales. So, that's a contribution. And the third piece that you see, which our customers are extremely excited about is the software bridge. We've basically made a lot of progress in building a software bridge of our instruments to -- our LC instruments to our light scattering instruments or Wyatt light scattering instruments. So, progress on all of those fronts that we talked about, our teams are super excited, seeing quite a good traction from our customers, especially as we start to see recovery in pre-commercial biotech and we see this also in the Cambridge Mass area.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks for the color. And then Amol, just on gross margins, you've mentioned a couple of dynamics that are helping drive that gross margin expansion. I'm just curious, obviously, price is a driver. But on the cost side, you mentioned sort of lower input costs on freight and materials. Are you sort of seeing some kind of leverage as the inflation comes down input costs come down as you're still increasing price? And do you expect that dynamic to continue through the balance of this year?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So look, I mean, on both the sides, our commercial teams as well as operations teams have done a great job through Q2. The commercial teams have delivered fantastic outcomes on price, which is flowing to our gross margin. And then on the operation side, we've sort of laser-focused on managing raw material costs, managing freight costs, optimizing freight lanes, consolidating freight vendors. And we've also focused on value engineering where possible to sort of work through specifications and reduce the cost of the product. And all that is playing out through our gross margin line, which expanded 230 basis points. And we think this outperformance will carry forward in the second half, which is why full year gross margin is 100 basis points up versus a year ago. We started on this journey of operational excellence two years ago, and it's starting to bear fruit. And we are really proud of what our teams have achieved in this space.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Josh Waldman from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two for you. I guess, first, Udit, a follow-up on pharma. I mean it sounds like you're seeing signs of life from pharma outside of China, but it also sounds like you're seeing slower than normal funnel build from pharma broadly. I guess I wondered if you could unpack that a bit? And then, I wondered if you could provide context on what the guide assumes in regards to a budget flush, would you expect a typical seasonal ramp in the fourth quarter from pharma in the West. Is that -- I mean, is that the a driver, I guess, to the assumption for a pretty significant step-up in organic in the fourth quarter?\nUdit Batra: Great questions, Josh, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on pharma more. Look, as we discussed in Q1, we are -- we see very high-quality funnels. We see customers who are really using our products to solve significant challenges. I mean the Alliance iS has gained a lot of traction on the small molecule side. On the large molecule side, we're seeing the BioAccord being used increasingly in bioprocessing applications. Our columns are doing very well. Our recurring revenues overall high single-digit for a very long time and pharma is no exception to that. You see all those trends playing out in both US and in Europe. That said, we have been cautious and we've said, look, we want to see more than one data point before we assume that the funnel velocities are increasing back to normal. They are slower across all market segments. We are seeing some green shoots in pharma for sure. We're seeing green shoots in biotech. Remember, precommercial biotech went cold both in US and in China altogether, in the US, we're starting to see that recover rather nicely. But I would like to wait for at least one more data point before I call it a complete recovery even in Europe and in the US So we are being a bit cautious with how we're seeing the funnel velocity. It's improved, but I'm not saying at this point that it's gone back to normal. But the quality of the discussions, the quality of the leads is really, really excellent across recurring revenues, meaning service, columns as well as instruments. And it's not just a mass spec story. LC is also doing pretty good and it's starting to do well in some of our pharma customers, as I mentioned, with the GLP-1 agonist where we won a competitive bid for UPLCs as well as our volumes. I'll let Amol comment on the guiding piece.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So I mean, Josh, if you look at our Q2 results and then look at Q3 and Q4 on a four-year stacked basis, they're all 6%. So what it essentially assumes is the dynamics that we saw in Q2, which was a demand slowdown in China and capital approval cycles becoming longer, we expect that to continue through Q3 and Q4. And hence, Q4 will sort of perform at the levels of Q2 on a stacked basis versus four years ago. Even on a two-year stack basis, the assumption there is our Q2 was roughly 6.5%, steps down to 5.5% in Q3 and further steps down to 5% in Q4.\nUdit Batra: So, when you -- so Josh, when you compare to previous years based on stacked and two years and four years stacked growth rates, Q3 or Q4 doesn't look any different than one another. And I think the question of budget flush, I mean both Amol and I have been on the receiving end of this when we were in pharma. The way it usually works is as you go through Q4, you see the CFO coming in and saying, hey, now I think I have visibility to my Q4 landing, go ahead and spend. And that's the dynamic that we've observed through and through all across our career. Even if it's a lower base, we expect that to modestly persist. But when you look at our competitors versus stacked two-year and four-year stacked growth rate, you don't see an acceleration in our assumptions.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. And then I guess, as you think about the current environment and where you position the near and medium term guide back at the Analyst Day, I mean, do you think Waters is still positioned to grow 100 bps plus above the market? And maybe more important, what do you think is the right way to think about market growth in the medium term in an environment where pharma is a bit more -- pharma a bit more cautious?\nUdit Batra: Crystal ball. Look, when I look at my crystal ball, I see tremendous unmet need in pharma. I see tremendous unmet need in the environmental segment with PFAS testing with battery testing in the industrial segment. And in pharma, in particular, I feel Waters is super, super well-positioned. Let me give you a couple of examples, right? We had the opportunity to comment on mass spec. There's a direct comparator when you just compare us to our peer group, we've grown 20% again this quarter, right, and you compare us to the ones we've already reported with my spec portfolios, they're a bit lower than this. So, we think we're gaining share with our new products. You think about our columns, right? I believe we have the best chemistry team in the industry that has really turned decisively towards solving problems for large molecules. And we've just introduced a column that's going to separate AAV and reduce sample size in that area dramatically, right? So, across the board, our innovation is targeted towards large unmet needs and we are gaining traction with our strong focus on execution. So, I think overall, we feel very good about how Waters is positioned. We feel we are already out-executing head-to-head many of our competitors in spaces where we're all together. And I expect that to be no different as the recovery accelerates. We're starting to see early signs of recovery in US and Europe. And again, as I said before, I'm not ready to call it yet until I have more than one data point. And as China recovers, we feel very well-positioned. So, yes, what we said on the Analyst Day still holds. Our core is very strong with strong new products with like Alliance iS, our adjacencies that we picked. We are already gaining traction across the board. And more on that as we go forward and we have more proof points in the other adjacencies as well, but feel extremely good about what we said. And finally, a comment on the margin. You've seen what we've done in Q2 and also the fact that we expect margin expansion both on the operating margin, 30 basis points on the operating margin for the full year despite the challenging environment, I think that should give you some confidence on the execution that we are seeing.\nOperator: And that was the last question we have time for.\nUdit Batra: Thank you. Thank you all for your questions and your participation today. And on behalf of our entire Waters team, I'd like to thank you for your support and your interest in Waters. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar and good morning everyone. Before diving into the results, I would like to start by saying that I'm very proud of how our teams have executed this quarter. We delivered a solid performance across our end markets despite a challenging environment and a stronger-than-expected slowdown in China. Our revitalized portfolio is driving results in areas of high unmet need as our newly launched products continue to gain traction and we're well-positioned for future growth as we make meaningful progress and make further investment in our high-growth adjacencies. Turning to our results. In the second quarter, we delivered at the high end of our guidance with 3% organic constant currency growth. We also had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which performed ahead of expectations and contributed 2% growth for the quarter. Overall, constant currency growth was 5% and our as-reported growth was 4%. Our organic constant currency performance was led by strong growth in the Industrial segment, which grew low double-digits and the academic and government segment, which grew over 20%. In both of these end markets, mass spec grew over 40%, as our revitalized portfolio saw continued strong demand. In the pharma segment, which declined 4%, both the US and Europe grew high single-digits, showing initial signs of recovery in pharma spend. However, this was more than offset by significant worsening in the China pharma market as weakness broadened beyond CDMOs. The weakness in China also impacted our instrument growth, which declined 2% in the quarter. When excluding China, instrument growth was 8%, led by mid-teens instrument growth in the US and low double-digit growth in Europe. Meanwhile, our recurring revenue grew high single-digits, driven by increased service plan attachment and chemical e-commerce adoption. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share came in above our expectations at $2.80, driven by operational excellence across pricing and procurement as well as our cost actions. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted shares were $2.55. Despite the challenging macro conditions, our commercial execution remains strong. So far this year within instruments, mass spec has grown high-teens on both a year-over-year and two-year stack basis as our commercial teams have capitalized on the strength of our renewed product portfolio. Our TA instruments division has also seen strong results despite macro challenges, having grown low double-digits year-over-year and on a two-year stack basis. Our commercial initiatives and strong execution have enabled high single-digit growth in recurring revenue. We have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points in 2023. We're now targeting an additional 100 basis points of expansion over the remainder of the year. The strength of our execution and the quality of our service offering is helping us drive this growth, and there is further runway ahead. Price is also a key part of our execution where we built commercial muscle and discipline in recent years. We've achieved strong results in price over 200 basis points so far this year. With our operational excellence, we expect to meaningfully expand our margins this year. For the first half of 2023, our gross margin is 58.9%, which is an expansion of 110 basis points versus the first half of 2022  For the full year, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59%, which is 100 basis points of expansion versus last year. We also expect to deliver an operating margin of 30.5% this year, which is 30 basis points higher than last year. Our revitalized portfolio is also driving results in areas of high unmet need. I would like to share a few specific examples. First, in the industrial segment, we're seeing strong growth in PFAS testing, and we are towards the beginning of a multiyear growth opportunity. Our growth in PFAS testing is twice as fast as the 20% estimated market growth rate as we continue to take share with our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec. In the academic and government segment, our high-res mass spec portfolio is seeing strong adoption at a time where global funding for R&D applications continues to be elevated. Select Series MRT is unique in the high-res mass spec market due to its enhanced resolution at high speeds, which gives it unique capabilities for metabolomics and imaging applications where throughput requirements are high.\\ At ASMS recently, we announced new enhancements for the MRT, which increases imaging resolution by 50% and boost sample throughput even further. Earlier this year, we launched Alliance iS, which we believe is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade. We've continued to see strong interest in its launch and several customers have already made plans to replace their LCs with this new industry leading platform. We now have not one but two new industry-leading LCs for QA/QC applications in pharma, Alliance iS and Arc HPLC. Both of these instruments answer significant unmet needs in the market, which continue to drive long-term growth in instrument replacement. And in our TA division, new product launches such as powder reology accessory and the battery cycle microcalimeter have supported growth in battery testing for electric vehicles. Battery testing is a fast growing market, and we are well-positioned to support demand for characterization that will lead to safer and better performing batteries. The strong results we've achieved in growing markets like batteries have allowed us to deliver double-digit growth in TA so far this year despite the challenging environment. We remain well-positioned for future growth and the long-term fundamentals of our business have never been better. While instruments are always prone to short-term fluctuations in spending patterns, instrument growth has been highly resilient on a long-term basis with average growth of about 5%. As we look ahead, the demand profile for our instruments has only strengthened versus this historical trend. Total global prescription drug sales, which is a key driver of instrument volume growth are expected to exceed historical growth rates for the foreseeable future. And our potential is further enhanced by the measures we have put in place to improve pricing where we expect to sustain 100 to 200 basis points improvement versus historical levels. In addition, the growing adoption of analytical instruments in process development and process optimization of large molecule therapeutics is a new growth vector for our business. Here, novel modalities require more advanced characterization techniques like mass spec and light scattering that have not been used in the past. We believe that this trend will not only continue, but will also pave the way for adoption of analytical instruments in high-volume, recurring applications and large molecule manufacturing. We expect this to occur as they become embedded within process control, QA/QC and raw material testing over time. We remain focused on nurturing this growth opportunity with our continued investment in bioanalytical characterization and bio separations. In bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate, we've been investing both organically and inorganically. We recently closed the acquisition of Wyatt, which expands our ability to characterize large molecules across various stages of production beyond that of what we can do with LC-UV and LC mass spec alone. We also recently announced an expansion in our collaboration with Sartorius from upstream development into downstream manufacturing. So far, in upstream process development, we've demonstrated that bearing BioAccord Arc line with the Sartorius Ambr 15 and 250 bioreactors has enabled bioprocess engineers to accelerate clone selection results from weeks to a matter of hours. Now our expanded collaboration will integrate our technologies further. We will develop analytical solutions that are in line and offer real-time monitoring of process controls and critical quality attributes in the bioreactor. By offering bioprocess engineers access to comprehensive analytical data for downstream batch and continuous manufacturing, we can support improved yields while reducing waste and lowering biomanufacturing costs. Finally, in Bioseparations, which is a $1.4 billion total addressable market with an 8% to 10% projected annual growth rate, we recently announced a multi-year research collaboration with Princeton University. The goal of this partnership is to advance research and drug discovery and development using novel bioseparation techniques that we're developing for large complex biomolecules. We also just introduced our first release in the new line of size exclusion chromatography columns, which are designed for the separation and analysis of viral vectors in applications such as gene therapy. Our new XBridge Premier GTx BEH SEC columns reduced the cost of gene therapies by using 3 to 10 times less sample than other methods, while generating faster results and providing more drug substance information. They can measure aggregation, titer and low molecular weight impurities at twice the speed of existing column at 50% greater resolution. The combination of these columns with wired multi-angle light scattering will deepen the level of information that can be acquired from a single experiment. This will accelerate development times of modalities such as adeno-associated viruses or AAV and allow for more optimized manufacturing, which can reduce costs. Turning now to our updated 2023 guidance. The slowdown in the pharma end market in China has progressed beyond CDMOs resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low digit -- low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Our guide does not assume any benefit from a new round of stimulus in the second half of the year. While our funnel remains healthy, we also continue to see slower than usual funnel velocity from customers more broadly. Assuming that, this trend continues through the rest of the year, we expect this to translate to a full year growth headwind of approximately 100 basis points versus our previous guide. As a result, we now expect our revised full year organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. Despite our lower revenue guide, we are proactively managing our cost and productivity while continuing to preserve our investments in future growth. In July, we made some very difficult but necessary decisions to realign the workforce in our core business, which impacted just under 5% of our employees. These actions allow us to better align our resources with our growth strategy and offset the incremental demand weakness that I just described. This, together with our focus on operational excellence across pricing and procurement is expected to deliver a gross margin of 59% this year, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2022. We also expect to expand our operating margin approximate to approximately 30.5%, which is an increase of 30 basis points versus 2022. These actions allow us to mitigate EPS headwind from lower expected revenue, resulting in our updated full year EPS guidance of $12.20 to $12.30. Now, I will pass the call to Amol to continue covering our second quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol? Thank you, Amol. Even through challenging times in the macroeconomic environment, we continue to come together as an organization to ensure we leave this world better than we found it. With our vibrant employee circles, we recently celebrated Pride Month as well as our Fantastic Women in Engineering. We also kicked off our third year of Water Student Academy, a summer program for high school students from underserved communities who are interested in exploring a career in science. We're also very proud recognized as one of US News & World Report Best Companies to Work For. So, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. Thank you for your question Vijay and good morning. Firstly, on mass spec. Over the long-term, so over two years -- just to answer your question, over the two-year CAGR is in the high teens, the four-year CAGR is in the high single-digits to double-digits. The story with mass-spec, Vijay, is twofold. One is of execution and the other one is of the traction of our new products. On the new products, we launched the Xevo TQ Absolute, which meets significant unmet needs in the PFAS area where we're growing double the rate of the market. I think we've heard the market grows roughly 20%. We're growing double that rate. In that particular market, our mass spec instruments are seeing terrific, terrific traction in the high-risk space where there's additional funding that academic institutions have. And as you move to the biologics area and bioprocessing our LCMS tools like the BioAccord and the enhanced workflows that we've developed are gaining traction. So if you compare our 20% print in this quarter or year-to-date or even versus last year on stacked, it compares very favorably to some of the peers who -- some of the mass spec heavy peers who have already reported their results. So we feel very good that we're gaining share in this market. And mass spec goes from strength to strength. And to your question now on overall instruments, look, take a step back and when you look at the overall instrument performance for this quarter, it's roughly two -- roughly negative 2%. Now this is an illustration of two things: one, strong execution and traction of innovation in the US and Europe and, of course, additional weakness in China. Let me comment on both. Starting with US and Europe, instrument growth rate in the United States was roughly 15%. Europe was 11%. And China, of course, declined close to 25% for the quarter for overall instruments. Now if you look at it from a portfolio perspective, we've already discussed mass spec. Mass spec to 20%. TA continued to grow double-digit in this quarter, and this is basically meeting unmet needs in the battery segment and several other segments in addition to strong execution. You move to LC. And again, let me double quick on this to illustrate my point on execution and a bit of recovery that we're seeing in US and Europe. Whereas in China, we saw LC get significantly worse, minus 40-ish percent growth. In the US and in Europe, we started to see growth again basically 4% -- 3%, 4% growth in both of those geographies. And you'll recall, in the first quarter call, we talked about our conversations with several for large pharma customers, and I have personally spoken to them. And the quality of the orders that we saw from an instrument perspective was terrific. It was just that the funnel velocity was lower, right? So the funnel velocity is still lower, and that's the assumption for the back half of the year. But we are seeing those orders -- we saw those orders come through this quarter. In fact, we won several competitive bids with -- give you an example of one of the largest GLP-1 manufacturers, this is the anti-obesity drug, where we won a competitive bid and our UPLCs are going to be not just with the originator, but also with all the CDMOs who are going to manufacture this product. And the same thing is true for columns. So instrument growth rate has been -- again, it's a tale of two sort of stories where US and Europe are seeing a nice recovery, good execution, great traction of new products and a little bit of lack of visibility in China, especially in pharma. And then I think finally, in the prepared remarks, we showed you the long-term growth rate of instruments, roughly 5-ish percent CAGR with a 60-ish percent gross margin and the low SG&A, I mean, I'll take that business any day. Now if you compare it to historical trends, we see additional vectors for growth. Pricing is better than we've seen in the past by 100 to 200 basis points. We see prescription growth rates are going up, which is the single largest driver for growth of LCs, and we see additional users, especially in large pharma, environmental and food testing. So I hope that gives you a picture of our mass spec as well as our instrument growth rate and why we are positive about that business. So, I'll start, and then I'll let Amol comment, Luke. Thank you for the question. I mean just starting with the second quarter first and how that plays out for the balance of the year, right? I mean in the second quarter, you saw roughly 3% growth. And it's sort of different in the US, Europe and China, right? In US and Europe, we see roughly 7%-ish growth and in China, we see continued decline of close to mid-teens. And as you now look at the balance of the year, we are starting to see a bit of a recovery, both in US and Europe. And I commented earlier to Vijay's question also on what we saw on instruments. But where we sit right now, we feel China has deteriorated further and there's a bit of lack of visibility. What we saw with CDMOs has now permeated into the rest of the pharma industry. So, we've decreased our guide overall by 300 basis points, 200 basis points of that is additional China slowdown. And we -- while the orders are very strong, while the execution is extremely strong in -- across the globe, new products are gaining traction. We think the funnel velocity has been slower towards the end of Q2, and we've used that projection for the balance of the year. So we've taken down the guide an additional 100 basis. So that's a 300 basis point drop versus what we told you in Q1 on the top line. Amol? Luke, that's a good question. And I don't think you'll hear us saying a lot different than what you've heard from many of our peers, right? In the long-term, China is a terrific growth market, we all know, right? And you've seen that through the history. But we saw in the second quarter a mid-teens decline in China. CDMOs got worse and people are just cautious, super cautious in spending in our pharma customers, across the traditional Chinese medicine customers, you see that permeating across the board. And it's not clear when that opens up. So we've assumed that for the full year, China is going to decline low to mid-double digits. Now when you look at -- and we've also not assumed that another stimulus is coming to grow the ANG market, and we've seen pretty dynamic growth for the first half of the year, that was driven by the stimulus that came late last year, and we've assumed that there's no stimulus coming for the balance of the year until we have clear visibility. So you've seen we've been very careful and cautious, but there's not a heck of a lot of visibility. What I'd like to remind you, though, from a Waters-specific case from 2016 to 2020, whenever Waters grew and whenever Waters growth rate fell, it was all correlated to China. This is very different now. We see that the US and Europe 2020, 2021 and now also 2022 and 2023, we seen US and Europe grow and contribute to growth really, really well in addition to China. So we feel that the business is very nicely diversified, and we see that we have growth in other geographies. And I'll conclude by saying China remains a dynamic market. Our teams have visited four to five times. The global teams have visited four to five times since the last time we spoke. And on the ground, you see incredible, incredible collaboration with our customers. You see, especially in the batteries market, China is well advanced of US and Europe, and we think the adoption for our TA products is going to grow much faster in China. If you go to the specialty diagnostics arena, China again, has been a front runner in adoption of mass spec in the clinical space, and we are working with several collaborators there to introduce our high-end mass specs in that workflow. And it's a matter of time that China will recover. We feel we are very well positioned to capitalize on it when it does. But in the short-term, you will not hear us say anything different about the visibility for the balance of the year than what you've already heard. Yes. And Dan, your line was breaking up a little bit. If I understand the question, you wanted a bit more color on pharma. And I guess you could ask, hey, you're seeing good trends in pharma or at least some recovery in both US and Europe. And recall that we talked about this in Q1, where we said we had conversations with large pharma players, and it was not a question of what, it was just a question of when they would place orders and some of those orders came through in Q2 and some fairly significant orders, right? I mentioned GLP-1 agonist. We are the UPLC of choice for a very large pharma manufacturer. In fact, both of them who are making GLP-1s columns replaced -- in our competitors' column, which is a rare, rare thing that happens in the industry because the customer said they wanted full end-to-end visibility on the supply chain. We are the only player in the industry who manufactures our own particles, our own columns, full end-to-end, and that gives us significant strength, right? So we saw share gain in pharma. We saw new products gaining traction in the bioprocessing arena. And you would have seen that we've just launched a column that is specifically targeted towards separating Adeno-Associated Virus. These are viral vectors used for set of gene therapy. And it brings me great pleasure to say that these are columns that are attached to our mouse [ph] instruments. So we are really executing well in pharma, wherever we have ability to access our customers and customers are purchasing. And new products are gaining traction. So for the second half of the year, we've just said, look, let's not just use one data point to extrapolate. We're looking for more data points, even in US and Europe, and we will gain even more confidence. But from where I sit today, I see excellent execution, excellent new product traction both in US and in Europe. And in China, like I said before, our visibility is just as much as others. And when China recovers, we'll execute like we're executing in U.S. and in Europe. So Derik, thanks for the question. We saw very modest drawdown in backlog orders were largely in line with sales for the quarter, and we see the same thing happening for the full year. That's the same assumption. So again, an indicator that says, like to the previous question, indicator that says that, look, trends are improving, especially in the US and in Europe for our large pharma customers and other customers. But yes, in this quarter, basically very modest single digit -- low single-digit million drawdown of backlog and the same assumption for the balance of the year. Derik, as a former academic myself, I can tell you we spend when we get the money. And when you get money like we like the academician are getting now, my old professors, my own colleagues, they spend as soon as they get it, right? So it pull forward or is it catch up, you cannot tell. It's a very -- it's a very volatile market. It goes up dramatically. It goes down dramatically. And it is correlated to only one thing, stimulus. And it is correlated to only one thing, stimulus. And you see stimulus coming across the globe. And what we've seen is dynamic growth in the US and Europe. And again, our mass spec portfolio -- the high res mass spec portfolio, our UPLC, our columns have done extremely, extremely well in this market around the globe, and we've won competitive bids across the board. So, I feel very good about our portfolio in that market, although it's a volatile market, it correlates very heavily with funding. I don't think it is catch up or pull forward. It is just opportunistic. When it comes, professors have money, and they buy. And I've done that myself as a previous academician. Matt, thank you for the question. You know that we closed the deal in this quarter. And really three drivers and we've talked about them in our previous discussions, and they're all contributing, right? The first one is column attachment to malls instruments, and this has gone as planned. Our columns are being shipped with the instruments as we speak. Second, in the column space itself, we've launched columns that are custom-made for solving problems for our customers, and in this case, our most recent X Bridge GTX column that we just launched and this is -- basically this was announced yesterday, but it's starting to ship now. There -- it speeds up measurements by over 50%, reduces sample size by 30% to a 100%. And that basically saves our customers a lot of samples. So, those -- that's already happening. Second, we have talked about lead generation. There are significant hundreds of leads that are -- that have been generated in -- especially in the US and in Europe, where there's a lot of access to our customers. And as emerging biotech and precommercial biotech starts to especially in the US, we're seeing the lead generation pick up quite dramatically and some of those leads have already been converted into sales. So, that's a contribution. And the third piece that you see, which our customers are extremely excited about is the software bridge. We've basically made a lot of progress in building a software bridge of our instruments to -- our LC instruments to our light scattering instruments or Wyatt light scattering instruments. So, progress on all of those fronts that we talked about, our teams are super excited, seeing quite a good traction from our customers, especially as we start to see recovery in pre-commercial biotech and we see this also in the Cambridge Mass area. Great questions, Josh, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on pharma more. Look, as we discussed in Q1, we are -- we see very high-quality funnels. We see customers who are really using our products to solve significant challenges. I mean the Alliance iS has gained a lot of traction on the small molecule side. On the large molecule side, we're seeing the BioAccord being used increasingly in bioprocessing applications. Our columns are doing very well. Our recurring revenues overall high single-digit for a very long time and pharma is no exception to that. You see all those trends playing out in both US and in Europe. That said, we have been cautious and we've said, look, we want to see more than one data point before we assume that the funnel velocities are increasing back to normal. They are slower across all market segments. We are seeing some green shoots in pharma for sure. We're seeing green shoots in biotech. Remember, precommercial biotech went cold both in US and in China altogether, in the US, we're starting to see that recover rather nicely. But I would like to wait for at least one more data point before I call it a complete recovery even in Europe and in the US So we are being a bit cautious with how we're seeing the funnel velocity. It's improved, but I'm not saying at this point that it's gone back to normal. But the quality of the discussions, the quality of the leads is really, really excellent across recurring revenues, meaning service, columns as well as instruments. And it's not just a mass spec story. LC is also doing pretty good and it's starting to do well in some of our pharma customers, as I mentioned, with the GLP-1 agonist where we won a competitive bid for UPLCs as well as our volumes. I'll let Amol comment on the guiding piece. So, when you -- so Josh, when you compare to previous years based on stacked and two years and four years stacked growth rates, Q3 or Q4 doesn't look any different than one another. And I think the question of budget flush, I mean both Amol and I have been on the receiving end of this when we were in pharma. The way it usually works is as you go through Q4, you see the CFO coming in and saying, hey, now I think I have visibility to my Q4 landing, go ahead and spend. And that's the dynamic that we've observed through and through all across our career. Even if it's a lower base, we expect that to modestly persist. But when you look at our competitors versus stacked two-year and four-year stacked growth rate, you don't see an acceleration in our assumptions. Crystal ball. Look, when I look at my crystal ball, I see tremendous unmet need in pharma. I see tremendous unmet need in the environmental segment with PFAS testing with battery testing in the industrial segment. And in pharma, in particular, I feel Waters is super, super well-positioned. Let me give you a couple of examples, right? We had the opportunity to comment on mass spec. There's a direct comparator when you just compare us to our peer group, we've grown 20% again this quarter, right, and you compare us to the ones we've already reported with my spec portfolios, they're a bit lower than this. So, we think we're gaining share with our new products. You think about our columns, right? I believe we have the best chemistry team in the industry that has really turned decisively towards solving problems for large molecules. And we've just introduced a column that's going to separate AAV and reduce sample size in that area dramatically, right? So, across the board, our innovation is targeted towards large unmet needs and we are gaining traction with our strong focus on execution. So, I think overall, we feel very good about how Waters is positioned. We feel we are already out-executing head-to-head many of our competitors in spaces where we're all together. And I expect that to be no different as the recovery accelerates. We're starting to see early signs of recovery in US and Europe. And again, as I said before, I'm not ready to call it yet until I have more than one data point. And as China recovers, we feel very well-positioned. So, yes, what we said on the Analyst Day still holds. Our core is very strong with strong new products with like Alliance iS, our adjacencies that we picked. We are already gaining traction across the board. And more on that as we go forward and we have more proof points in the other adjacencies as well, but feel extremely good about what we said. And finally, a comment on the margin. You've seen what we've done in Q2 and also the fact that we expect margin expansion both on the operating margin, 30 basis points on the operating margin for the full year despite the challenging environment, I think that should give you some confidence on the execution that we are seeing. Thank you. Thank you all for your questions and your participation today. And on behalf of our entire Waters team, I'd like to thank you for your support and your interest in Waters. Thank you, and have a wonderful day."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales grew 4% as reported. Organic constant currency sales grew 3% as Waters division grew 2% and TA grew 11%. We had a great start to the Wyatt acquisition, which exceeded our expectations and added 2% constant currency sales growth. FX was a 1% headwind in the quarter. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 11% and academic and government grew over 20%. In pharma, high single-digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, was more than offset by a pronounced slowdown in China pharma, which declined over 40%. In industrial, Waters Division and TA both grew low double digits with broad strength across all regions. In our Water business, strength was led by food and environmental testing where we saw continued strong growth in global PFAS testing applications driven by our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spectrometer. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and microcalorimetry. We again saw strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronics testing, which more than offset weakness in more cyclical revenues from materials and chemicals. In academic and government, there was continued strong demand in upstream applications from our refreshed mass spec portfolio supported by elevated funding levels across the globe. Mass spec sales more than doubled in the U.S., grew approximately 50% in Europe and grew 30% in Asia. By product, strength was led by our high-res mass spec portfolio with applications in metabolomics and spatial biology, resulting in strong growth for cyclic IMS and Select Series MRT. Now by geography, sales in Asia declined 5%, the Americas grew 7% and Europe grew 9%. In Asia, China declined high-teens. Excluding China, Asia grew 6%, with India growing high single digits and Japan growing mid single digits. In the Americas, pharma grew 6%, led by 7% growth in the U.S., industrial grew 3% and academic and government grew almost 30%. In Europe, pharma grew 7%, industrial grew 6% and academic and government grew over 35%. In both Americas and Europe, these results reflect two-year stacked growth of high single digits or above across each of the end markets. By products and services, instrument declined 2% overall as mass spec growth of almost 20% and double-digit growth in TA Instrument Systems was more than offset by China pharma demand weakness led by LC. Recurring revenues grew high single digits. Chemistry growth was supported by continued strength in MaxPeak Premier columns, which grew over 50% in the quarter. Service growth continues to be supported by strong pull-through from recent instrument sales and increasing service plan attachment, which has already increased by another 100 basis points in the first half of the year. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was approximately 59.3%, an expansion of 230 basis points compared to 57% in the second quarter of 2022. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 29.6%, an expansion of 120 basis points compared to 28.4% in the second quarter of 2022. Our margin expansion was driven by strong operational performance with pricing gains, lower material and freight costs as well as prudent management of spend. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Average share count came in at 59 million shares, which is about 1.5 million less than the second quarter of last year. On non-GAAP -- our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.80. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.55. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $73 million after funding $47 million of capital expenditures. Free cash flow is impacted by higher inventory balances, timing of income tax payments and wire transaction expenses. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation in well thought-out, attractive adjacent markets. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $2.3 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 2.3. This represents an increase of $1.3 billion during the quarter, which is related primarily to the Wyatt acquisition. As we previously disclosed, we have temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year to use our free cash flow to delever the acquisition. Now I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. As Udit outlined, the slowdown in China pharma has progressed beyond CDMOs, resulting in broader weakness. As a result, we now expect China to decline low double digits this year versus our prior expectation of low single-digit growth. This translates to a full year growth headwind of approximately 200 basis points versus our previous guide. Additionally, while our funnel remains strong, we are observing longer capital purchasing approval cycles amongst our customers broadly due to spending caution in the current environment. We expect these dynamics to continue through the rest of the year and contribute an additional 100 basis points full year growth headwind versus our previous guide. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic constant currency sales growth guide to 0.5% to 1.5%, which translates to a 2-year stack growth of approximately 6% to 6.5%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on the full year sales. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect wire transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 3% to 4%. We expect gross margin to be approximately 59% for the year, which is 100 basis points expansion versus last year and is higher than our previous guide. We expect operating margin to be approximately 30.5%, which translates to 30 basis points of margin expansion versus last year. Cost actions in our core business are expected to deliver approximately $45 million in annualized savings and are expected to contribute $20 million in 2023, predominantly in the fourth quarter. We will progressively redeploy part of these savings to resource our growth strategy and to expand capacity on high-growth end market opportunities. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately 59 million, given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $12.20 to $12.30, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 1 percentage point at the current FX rates. Looking to the third quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China. We also expect cautious spending from our customers throughout the quarter. Hence, we expect third quarter organic constant currency sales growth of negative 4% to negative 2%, which translates to two-year stacked growth of approximately 5.5% at midpoint, given the mid-teens comp from last year. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to add approximately 1% and we expect to Wyatt to add 4% to our third quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total third quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1% to 3%. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 with a neutral currency impact. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. So, a couple of things there, Vijay, right. I mean the step up on the growth is purely related to the baselining. So, if you look at it on a two-year or a four-year stacked basis, Q3 and Q4 guide is pretty consistent. So, on a four-year stack basis, both Q3 and Q4 are growing 6%. Two, if you sort of look at the ramp-up in dollar million sales. I mean we typically do 24% of our full year revenue in Q3 and about 30% in Q4. And so the guide is sort of consistent with that, with sort of tad caution on Q3. And so that's sort of consistent with the past. And it also sort of accounts for the fact that whatever we see in Q3 in terms of China slowdown and cautious spending with pharma will continue into Q4. And then as you look into Q4 EPS, you see a steep ramp versus last year of about 15% growth, but again, there are various factors that are contributing to it. I mean as Udit outlined, we've taken cost actions and a predominant portion of those cost action savings will show up in Q4. That, coupled with productivity gains that our teams have managed across pricing, across materials and freight, across other areas of procurement, those two things together, we get about 5% of that growth coming from the cost actions, another 3% to 4% of that growth coming out of productivity. So, that's the big portion of the 15% increase that you see in the EPS in Q4. The rest is there is 3% FX benefit. Wyatt is normal dilutive in Q4, so there is a net neutral impact there. And then there is the lower share count, about 1.5% underlying sales growth. Yes. And I mean if you sort of go through the individual components, right, China, as we said, is a low double-digit growth for the full year. It's slightly more elevated in the second half versus the first half in our guide assumptions. Rest of the world in the first half grew mid-single digits. The assumption for the second half is low single-digits. LC sort of grew mid-teens decline in the first half, and that's sort of also our second half assumption versus mass spec and TA. Just given the situation, and we've reduced it to sort of low to mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year. So as you see, I mean, we've sort of risk-adjusted a big portion of our second half of the year given what's playing out in the market. Yes. So, Dan, look, I mean we looked at how things have progressed through Q2. And if you look at the regions, even outside China, we have meaningfully reduce our outlook for those regions. As I said before, those regions grew mid-single-digits. Outside China, we are now estimating low single-digits. Instruments declined low single-digits. We are assuming for the second half, it will decline mid-single-digits as growth normalizes for mass spec and TA. Even recurring revenues, we've sort of stepped them down from mid to high single-digits to mid-single-digits for the second half. And we sort of assumed A&G and industrial normalize in the second half of the year. Now, based on those assumptions, we think it's reasonable given how things are playing out, I think the one wildcard still remains how out of China plays out in Q3 and Q4 because we know China goes down fast, but it also comes back fast. We haven't assumed any second half China stimulus in our number. So, if that comes, it will be an upside. But otherwise, we feel comfortable where our guide is for Q3 and for the second half. Yes. So, I mean, Dan, look, I mean our teams in US and Europe see an exceedingly great job in Q2. Our win rates were up. They positively surprised us with great outcomes with the level of growth that they manage, right? As we look into the second half for those teams, right now, we've sort of tapered the guidance down to low single-digit growth in those regions. But the way our teams are executing in these markets gives us great confidence that they will be able to do a great job in these markets as things start to come back. Yes. So look, I mean, on both the sides, our commercial teams as well as operations teams have done a great job through Q2. The commercial teams have delivered fantastic outcomes on price, which is flowing to our gross margin. And then on the operation side, we've sort of laser-focused on managing raw material costs, managing freight costs, optimizing freight lanes, consolidating freight vendors. And we've also focused on value engineering where possible to sort of work through specifications and reduce the cost of the product. And all that is playing out through our gross margin line, which expanded 230 basis points. And we think this outperformance will carry forward in the second half, which is why full year gross margin is 100 basis points up versus a year ago. We started on this journey of operational excellence two years ago, and it's starting to bear fruit. And we are really proud of what our teams have achieved in this space. Yes. So I mean, Josh, if you look at our Q2 results and then look at Q3 and Q4 on a four-year stacked basis, they're all 6%. So what it essentially assumes is the dynamics that we saw in Q2, which was a demand slowdown in China and capital approval cycles becoming longer, we expect that to continue through Q3 and Q4. And hence, Q4 will sort of perform at the levels of Q2 on a stacked basis versus four years ago. Even on a two-year stack basis, the assumption there is our Q2 was roughly 6.5%, steps down to 5.5% in Q3 and further steps down to 5% in Q4."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call. This conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Waters' Corporation first quarter earnings call. Today, I am joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions, including with respect to the close of the Wyatt transaction, that impacts Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2023 and full-year 2023. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs, and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which were available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all the year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are given on a comparable constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our predictions or projections except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Udit, to deliver our key messages for the quarter and then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we'll open up the phone lines to take questions. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. For this morning, I'll start by giving you color on our first quarter results, as well as our updated guidance. Then I will cover some of our recent product launches, including Alliance iS, and I will also provide an update on Wyatt. Our first quarter results were below our expectations with revenue growth of 3% on a constant currency basis, versus our expected 4% to 6% growth. This was largely driven by weaker-than-expected demand for instruments in biotech and pharma, which I will cover in a moment. As you know, we had an extraordinary Q1 last year with 16% constant currency growth. Even though our first quarter this year was slower than expected, it still represents a very healthy two-year stack growth of approximately 9.4%. We also saw good overall strength in our recurring revenues, which continued to grow in the high single digits, as well as mass spec and DA, both of which grew double digits. Our end markets remain resilient, and our leadership team continues to drive strong commercial execution. We have further strengthened our revitalized portfolio with a steady stream of innovative new products. Finally, we've added M&A to our growth strategy with our pending acquisition of Wyatt. And we continue to invest organically in our high growth adjacencies, which are also on track and are gaining momentum. Reviewing our first quarter results in more detail; our performance was impacted by a combination of three factors. First, China was weaker than anticipated as pharma customers scaled back purchases. Second, while we have limited exposure to pre-commercial biotech, we have seen a pronounced scale back in demand from these customers as they have significantly reduced spending to conserve capital. And third, several of our large to medium-sized pharma customers delayed timing of instrument orders due to macroeconomic caution. Each of these dynamics occurred late in the quarter and led to instruments declining 3% after they grew over 25% in the first quarter of last year. By end market, the impact was to our pharma business, which declined 4% overall. This was offset by strength in the academic and government segment, which grew 45%, and industrial, which grew 3%, while our recurring revenues remained strong across service and chemistry. As a result of this lower-than-expected volume, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares also came below our expectations at $2.49 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. As we look ahead, we are assuming that spending among pharma customers in China will remain scaled back for the balance of the year and while our exposure to pre-commercial biotech is low, we also believe that the slowdown in this space is likely to persist for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're lowering our 2023 guide due to these two factors. We now expect our fully organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We believe that large-to-medium pharma-sized budgets remain in place. We expect spending among these customers to catch up and be stronger in the second half of the year after delayed spending in the first half. Despite our revised revenue guide, our full year EPS guidance, and free cash flow generation expectations remain unchanged. We intend to proactively manage our spend and working capital, and Amol will cover this in more detail. Even with short-term market challenges, our sources for growth remain intact. Our end markets are robust, with almost 80% of our business exposed to durable growth areas. This includes demand for QA/QC testing of commercialized medicines, increased scrutiny of PFAs in food and water, and the testing of batteries used in applications such as electric vehicles. Our team has developed a strong commercial discipline that is supported by best-in-class innovative new products that address evolving customer unmet needs. We're also seeing high single-digit growth in our recurring revenues, which are over 50% of our annual sales. Chemistry growth is supported by strong end-market activity, growth in biologic applications with our MAX peak premier columns, and our e-commerce initiative. For service, we're seeing strong pull-through from our instrument sales, and increased service plan attachment is supporting the growth. We expect service plan attachment for our instruments to increase by another 100 basis points this year, building on the 350 basis point expansions in 2019. Our revitalized portfolio has been further strengthened with a recent launch of Alliance iS, which is our next-generation intelligent HPLC system. We believe it is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade, and it provides a major leap forward in lab productivity. Not only is the instrument easy to use with its large touchscreen interface, but can eliminate common user errors by up to 40%. It does this by guiding users between steps with a highly intuitive interface. It intelligently conducts a number of real-time system checks before a sample is run. This helps ensure that the instrument is configured correctly for the method that is being tested. Before now, errors such as incorrect solvent or the wrong column being used are usually discovered after the sample has been run, which results in wasted time and a wasted sample. Given the strength of the Alliance brand and the significant new features that this instrument offers, we had a strong reception at its launch. Since quality testing is such a critical component of pharmaceutical manufacturing, customer interest has been strong, including from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, who noted that Alliance iS feels like the future is here and has already made plans to replace a large number of its LCs with this instrument. We now have not one, but two new industry-leading platforms for QA/QC applications in pharma, Arc HPLC and its biocompatible equivalent Arc Premier, and now higher-end Alliance iS, which sits at the top of the range. Last month, we also launched our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec into clinical applications. Not only is this the most sensitive triple-quad on the market for PFAs detection, where it has seen strong traction in food and environmental testing, but now, within clinical, it is up to five times more sensitive than other competing instruments in the segment. This sensitivity enables clinical labs to detect and measure trace-level analytes at lower detection levels than was previously possible. It also enables clinical labs to expand their test menu to include multiplex panels. Meanwhile, our TA Instruments business launched a new microcalorimeter for battery testing essential for electric vehicle, energy storage and electronics applications. This provides customers with a significant upgrade as it accelerates validation of battery safety, quality and performance testing by up to 75%, which while collecting up to six times more data than other calorimeters. Lastly, we also recently launched a new system monitoring software product on Waters Connect, the first us and unique to the industry. Developed in consultation with QA/QC scientists, it enables real-time monitoring of all chromatography instruments controlled by our Empower software. It helps increase productivity of QA/QC labs by allowing customers to analyze their instrument fleets at anytime from anywhere to monitor uptime, usage levels and real-time system availability. Each of these new products have been developed in close collaboration with our customers to address their most pressing unmet needs. They further support the strength of our revitalized portfolio. Earlier this year, we announced our intent to acquire Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering. With more than 80% of its revenues tied to large molecule applications, Wyatt expands Waters' portfolio and increases our exposure to faster growth areas within biologics. It also increases our ability to build a business in bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate. We remain on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We also expect the transition to deliver immediate growth and adjusted operating margin accretion. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our first quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales grew 3% in constant currency. This came below our expectations due to the demand dynamics in our pharma business, which Udit outlined earlier. Waters' division grew 2% and TA grew 10%. By end market, pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 3%, and academic and government was very strong at 45% growth. In pharma, weakness was led by China and the US. In China, we saw customers recalibrate their spending plans, and in the US, our large to medium pharma customers delayed spending due to macroeconomic caution. Our small biotech customers, which is a small portion of our business, scaled back spending to conserve capital in light of more pronounced funding concerns. In industrial, growth was led by Asia, which grew 6%, and the Americas, which grew 2%. In our Waters' business, we saw continued strong growth in PFAs testing applications. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and rheology. We have seen continued strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronic testing. Academic and government had a great start to the year as elevated funding resulted in strong demand for our refreshed mass spec portfolio. Strength was brought across all our geographies. By product, strength was broad across our high-res mass specs such as Cyclic IMS and our tandem cards such as TQ Absolute. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 6%, the Americas declined 1%, and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China declined mid-single digits for the quarter. Excluding China, Asia grew mid-teens with broad strength across our end markets. In the Americas, pharma declined mid-single digits given delayed spending against a tough comp of over 30%. Industrial grew 2%, and academic and government grew over 25%. Europe grew 3% in the quarter with strength also led by academic and government, which grew over 40%. By products and services, instruments declined 3% overall, but both our mass spec and TA instrument systems grew double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 10% and service up 8%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2022, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.5% compared to 58.6% in the first quarter of 2022 in line with our expectations. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 26.8% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2022, driven by sales mix and 120 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.4%. Average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter was $2.49 in comparison to $2.80 last year. Foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $166 million after funding $34 million of capital expenditures, which represents approximately 24% of our sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaning fully accelerate value creation in wealth on attractive adjacent markets. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 173,000 shares of our common stock for $58 million early in the quarter. As we previously disclosed, we have since temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year, so that we can use our free cash flow to fund the Wyatt acquisition. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $990 million, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Now, I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. Our end markets remain resilient, and we expect our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives to enhance our performance. However, as Udit covered earlier, we are revising our growth to account for the scale-back of purchases from our customers in China and the slowdown in small biotech. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic, constant currency sales growth guidance to 3% to 5% excluding Wyatt. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on full year sales, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 5.5% to 7.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt. We expect organic growth margins to be approximately 58.5% for the year, and organic operating margins to be approximately 30.5%. This is higher than our previous guide due to anticipated cost savings in our core business and an improvement in FX. This now translates to 50 basis points of margin expansion, net of investment in adjacencies, partially offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points. As we previously mentioned, we anticipate the expected addition of Wyatt in Q2 of this year will be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by approximately 25 basis points. Including the Wyatt transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Consistent with our prior expectations, the transaction is expected to add $40 million of additional interest expense for a total of $80 million interest expense. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately $59.3 million given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the Wyatt transaction, is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90, which is unchanged from our previous guide, and includes a negative currency impact of approximately one percentage point at current rates. Including Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is also unchanged projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the second quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China, along with the slowdown in pre-commercial biotech. We also expect cautious spending levels from our large pharma customers to continue until end of the second quarter before catching up in the second half of the year. Hence, we expect second quarter organic constant currency sales growth of 1% to 3%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately one percentage point resulting in second quarter reported organic sales growth guidance of 0% to 2%. Assuming a mid-May close, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.5% to our second quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1.5% to 3.5%, including Wyatt. Excluding the Wyatt transaction, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range, $2.60 to $2.70, with a negative currency impact of approximately three percentage points, including Wyatt, which is expected to result in an EPS headwind of $0.08, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $2.52 to $2.62. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amul. So to summarize, despite a slower than expected start to the year, our end markets are resilient and we expect to see increased strength in the second half of the year. While we have revised our revenue guide, we're maintaining our full year EPS guide due to our robust financial model and the acceleration of our growth strategy remains on track, with continued progress on all of our high growth adjacencies, and with our pending acquisition of Wyatt Technology. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues around the world who've continued to demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Waters with their focus on strong commercial execution and revitalized innovation. We also look forward to welcoming our future Wyatt colleagues. Finally, I'm proud to share that Waters continues to be globally recognized for its strong ESG profile, placing at number five on the Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for 2023. This is the second year that we've been placed in the top 10 after receiving more than 20 awards in 2022, recognizing the company for excellence in product innovation, leadership strength, and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments, and we are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Luke Sergott of Barclays. Awesome. Your line is open, sir.\nLuke Sergott: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I want to start off on the academic and government strength that you guys saw in the quarter, particularly in China, you guys called that out, but it was strong across every region. So, are you -- did you guys see any pushouts in there from the 4Q? Just talk about what you're seeing there as that kind of goes forward. So this isn't just a onetime thing.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Thanks, Luke, and good morning. Look, it's a great start to the year with about 45% growth, and this is largely due to the elevated global funding that we're seeing across the globe and the strong demand for our high res mass spec portfolio. This growth was, of course, led by China, which grew over 80% versus previous year. And of course, we saw the same thing happening not to that same extent in magnitude but in the U.S., in India and in Europe, all had a nice growth well into the double-digit territory. So Academic and Government, as you know, is a segment that's rather lumpy. So I would rather not extrapolate Q1 to the rest of the year. So we assume that we will see the second half that will become more normalized and the full year will be more in the low double-digit to teens range given such a strong start to the year.\nLuke Sergott: Okay. Great. And then when you guys talked about the -- on the guide down, part being from biotech customers and in part being from large pharma kind of pushing out their spending. Can you help size what those actually were and contributed to the guidance cut for the year?\nUdit Batra: So look, just to sort of take a step back. The full year guide -- for the full year guide, we have assumed 3% to 5% in constant currency, right? And on a 2-year stacked basis, this is still high single digits. We like to -- we think like the first quarter, the spending at Chinese CDMO customers and the pre-commercial biotech customers remains constrained for the balance of the year. And to remind you, on the China side, we've grown the CDMO presence over the last 2 years. We've actually tripled that business, right? So it's gone dramatically up. So we think -- like the first quarter, the spending in the Chinese CDMO customers and the pre-commercial biotech customers will remain sort of muted. On the other hand, we're assuming that the large pharma customers who delayed orders for instruments will come in the second half of the year. And here, over the last 2 weeks, I've personally spoken to several large customers, both in the U.S. and Europe to understand the situation. And the funding remains very much intact, and the POs were simply delayed. So we're expecting those to come largely in the second half of the year. So then the 3% to 5% guide would then imply that for the full year, China will grow in the low single digits versus our previous assumption of high single digits. Pharma will also remain in the low single-digit category with combined pressure from China CDMO and pre-commercial biotech, and instruments for the year will grow flat to low single digits and recurring revenues in the high single digits, right? So I hope that gives you a flavor for the drivers of the full year guidance and how we stepped it down. Amol, do you want to comment on the quantitative aspects.\nAmol Chaubal: No, I think you got it, right. Yes.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Udit, back to some of your comments here. What is the Waters exposure to this emerging biopharma? Was that down 50%? Any directional sense and now what the business did? And in this -- Wyatt -- I understand they have exposure to large pharma. Is there any risk here on Wyatt's -- what is Wyatt's exposure to emerging biopharma.\nUdit Batra: So let me -- so Vijay, thank you for the question. First, on the biotech exposure. Our biotech customers, broadly speaking, constitute between 10% to 15% of our pharma business. and with more heavier weighting in the U.S. and China where the biotech industry is even more developed. Pre-commercial biotech, which is where we saw the slowdown is a subset of this and is roughly half of it, right? So if you do the math, that's roughly 5% to 7% of our pharma business, right, and largely focused on the U.S. and in China. So during Q1, pre-commercial biotech companies, of course, got extremely cautious and virtually halted their instrument purchases, especially later in March. We're starting to see some relaxation but we've assumed that this situation will persist for the balance of the year. And over the long -- over the long term, I don't need to remind you, the biotech industry plays an extremely important role in the innovation that we see across health care, and they remain our very, very strong customers. Now to your question on Wyatt, roughly 80% of the Wyatt business is focused on biologics applications. Wyatt has historically been very strong in academic and government and for biologics applications, we're characterizing large molecules like cell and gene therapy and cell and gene therapy and proteins and monoclonal antibodies. We expect this business for the balance of the year once the close happens to remain in the low double digit -- low double-digit category. And as Amol said, this would add roughly 25% of our incremental revenue for Waters for the rest of the year. So we expect this to continue to remain extremely strong for the balance of the year.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Then Amol, 1 for you. The second quarter EPS guidance implies, I think the operating margins in Q2 to be roughly similar to Q1. Given you really trace the annual EPS guidance, it looks like back half has to be like low 30s operating margins, that's a massive step up, I think, 500 basis points or 600 basis points from doing the math correctly. What is driving the second half margin expansion versus first half? Is there any synergies being baked in from the Spire transaction? Or perhaps is Waters contemplating any restructuring actions?\nAmol Chaubal: So there are a couple of things, which, that play into the second half of the year, right? One is the volume in the second half is typically higher than the first half, and that produces some degree of volume leverage and our gross margin profile in the second half is slightly better than that in the first half. Two, we also benefit from exchange rate in the second half. Remember, in the first half, is still a headwind in the second half FX is a tailwind. And three, given the revised sort of the demand outlook, we plan to proactively manage our costs and intend to keep our operating expenses relatively flat in the second half versus the first half. And if you are able to do that, then it allows us to produce the kind of margin expansion and EPS that we've guided for the second half.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan Brennan of TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Maybe the first 1 just on the guide. Just wondering, was there a discussion maybe to cut beyond the 3 to 5, just wondering your kind of ripping the mandate of here given some of the factors you pointed to. But do you feel that guide provides still healthy cushion given all the uncertainties you are flagging. It's still, as you pointed out, Udit, it's still kind of in high single-digit to your stack, which is above your long-term LRP, and you do have these factors and you're banking on a recovery in the back half of the year for large pharma.\nUdit Batra: Yes. So Dan, thank you for the question. Look, I mean, we spend a lot of time clinically dissecting what happened in Q1 and why it came below our expectations with a 3% or so -- 3% or so growth, right? And the reasons that I outlined the slowdown in Chinese CDMO customers start down the purchasing of Chinese CDMO customers who largely serve US and European pharma customers. We think that will persist for the balance of the year. We think the pre-commercial biotech spending will remain muted. And at least that's what we've assumed, even though we see some signs of that improving, we've assumed that, that remains muted. And then thirdly, we expect the deferral of purchases of instruments in large pharma customers to come back. And we looked at this super carefully, and I personally spoke to some large pharma customers. They have the budget. They have the funding. It simply was caution to delay the purchases. And now with a very strong revitalized portfolio, we feel very good about being able to compete for orders across the instrument portfolio. So you put it all -- you put it all together, you basically see that the instruments are -- instrument growth will be flat or low single digit at most for the full year. Recurring revenues, which have gone from strength to strength is over 50% of our business gets into the high single-digit category. Pharma, which has been our sort of strongest grower in many -- for many, many years. We also assume in aggregate will be flat to low single digits. And China, again, a strong growth driver will end up flat to low single digits. So I think we've been rather cautious about our guidance, and we've taken all the factors into account. And as you said, I mean, the full year stack looks very good, just given the strength we've built from a commercial perspective. and the strong innovative portfolio that we have put forth in the market. And with the close of Wyatt, that should add a little bit of -- a little bit more momentum.\nDan Brennan: Great. And maybe just a follow-up, just on instruments, so flat to low single that's kind of a high single-digit stack against what you guys did. You've obviously had tremendous growth there. Can you just unpack that a little bit? It sounds like mass spec doing terrific. Could you just give us a flavor for the relative contribution between mass spec and LC and if you want to give us any regional, I don't know how far down the whole you want to go. But just give us a sense of what's incorporated into that low single.\nUdit Batra: The instrument sales for this quarter declined roughly 4%, right? And as you rightly pointed out, this is on the base -- on the back of a 26% growth in Q1 2022, right? So a pretty strong comp. Now mass spec grew high teens. So strength to strength. And on a multiyear basis, it's a high-teen growth. TA grew double digits, while LC declined in teens. Now to your question on LC or deeper question on LC, the sales were impacted disproportionately by the decline that we saw in the purchase by pharma customers, and these are Chinese CDMOs serving U.S. and European customers, as I mentioned, the pre-commercial biotechs and also the delayed orders that I talked about for large pharma. So disproportionately impacting LC. Now just to put this all in a bit of perspective, you see in an instrument business, we will always see fluctuations. And -- but what is important to remember is that over the long term. Our instrument business has grown in a 4% to 5% range with a gross margin of roughly 60%, right? It's a pretty attractive area to be in. We, during this time, looked at our instrument growth rates for the last 20 years, starting to 2004, we basically looked at every year. And you come away with just 2 very simple insights. First, the average growth hovers around 4% to 5%. Second, there is a fluctuation around this mean which generally gets exaggerated around economic slowdowns like in 2008 and '09, 2011 and '12, but the volume always returns within 1 to 2 quarters. So whenever there is a delay, especially in the case of LC, which is over 70% of replacement business, this fluctuation always subsides and you return to your average of about 4% to 5%. So we're pretty positive, and we feel very confident about the deferred businesses coming back especially now given our terrific commercial execution that you pointed out and our renewed portfolio, especially in the small molecule LC segment where Arc HPLC now is augmented by Alliance IS we should see the instrument growth returning back to normal before long. So for the full year, then we've basically assumed still a flat to low single-digit instrument growth in aggregate. And recurring revenues at the high single-digit range. In the second half of the year, you'll start to see trends that are more like pre-COVID times, right? So I hope that gives you a bit of flavor on what the assumptions are and how we've thought about it.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Maybe just to dig a little bit more on the large pharma side. It's quite clear your expectations for the second half recovery, and this is a delay I'm just wondering, just given some of the news we've seen from some of the larger pharma about rationalizing their R&D spend. Has there been any kind of reprioritizing of those R&D budgets, whether it's inflation Reduction Act, prompting them to move into a large molecule or anything like that? Or do you truly see this as sort of a temporary delay in terms of ordering?\nUdit Batra: So Matt, great question, right? And so I personally then decided to speak to several of the large pharma customers, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And basically, we find that the budgets are still very much intact, like many companies like us as well. We are being more cautious with capital spend, and we are taking longer to approve capital spend, and that's what's happened in large pharma as well. So there is no talk of not doing replacements or not adding instrument fleets that they had planned altogether. Second, what I'll remind you is that our business is more heavily weighted towards the QA/QC segment, which is more proportional to manufacturing volumes, right? And so R&D spend if it comes under pressure, does not impact, especially our LC business, which more weighted towards Q3 and especially on the small molecule side. So really no real indicator there that, that would slow down. And finally, Matt, feel extremely good about our commercial execution that we -- that has demonstrated what we've been able to do over the last 2 to 2.5 years. Where we have really grown rather nicely with all the instrument replacement initiatives also on the consumables side, which remains extremely strong, and consumables, I'll remind you, is an indicator of pharma activity, right? If that is growing high single digit, what you find is there is significant activity still occurring in the -- with the pharmaceutical customers. So we believe it's just a matter of time that the instrument orders that were delayed in large pharma will come back. So we have a lot of cooperating evidence that suggests that this is coming back. But we've been rather cautious, even though we see some indicators of it coming back already, we've been rather cautious to assume that most of the spend will come in the second half of the year.\nMatt Sykes: Great. That's very helpful color. And then just my follow-up would just be on the industrial end market. You've done a really good job in the past of kind of decomposing the subsegments there, and you talked about strength in batteries and PFAS. But maybe could you talk a little bit more about the subsegments where you're seeing some maybe softness in where you're seeing continued strength.\nUdit Batra: So I mean just taking a step back, Matt, the industrial segment of Waters has dramatically changed over the last 15 years or so, right? I mean, basically, it's now constituted heavily of food and environmental and the TA business has 40% of it is in the more resilient segments like batteries also serving some parts of life science, right, out of the TA. Now to just decompose the results for the quarter. I mean, it grew -- the industrial business grew roughly 3%. It was led by TA again, which grew 10%, almost 10% and PFAS testing, which we've talked about several times in our previous which continues to grow really, really rapidly. And in TA, roughly 40% of the business is now in the more resilient segments with batteries really continuing to grow nicely. So when I double click on TA, I mean it has the same sort of dynamics that the Waters division does, right? So we've really our focus on commercial execution, new products, especially ones relevant for high-growth areas for thermal analysis and geology, and we just talked about our new battery calorie meter that sets a new standard in testing batteries and their efficiency and effectiveness. It's just been launched, right? So we feel very good about where the TA business stands going forward. So if I just put all of that together for the full year, we're assuming a mid-single-digit growth in our industrial business, led by the strength that we continue to see in TA and PFAS testing.\nOperator: The next question will come from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nDerik De Bruin: I have a question for you. I mean, I've been covering Waters for a long time. And we've seen some of the spending patterns before. I mean historically, pharmas have delayed their budget releases in Q1 and things pick up in 2Q. But by the same token, if we're going back to sort of like historical seasonality, 3Q then is always a crapshoot in terms of what spending is because you won't have any real visibility until September. So I'm just sort of why are we not back to some of these sort of seasonal patterns? And then you're -- and everything essentially end up riding on the fourth quarter and like this. I'm just sort of curious, are we -- is there anything more different going on here than just return to normal seasonality?\nUdit Batra: That's a fantastic question, Derik, and I expected you to ask something that relates to the history of Waters in general. Look, you're totally right. We think the second half of the year will start to approximate what we've seen in the past, right? That's why if you just look at the growth rate of the second half of the year, it's between 4% and 7%. Instruments now starting to traverse into the low to mid-single digits and consumables well above our historical averages reversing at the high single digit, right? So it does start to look like historical patterns. And if you just now look at the specifics, right, as I said, we basically said, look, the CDMO spending in China, the pre-commercial biotech is not coming back. Now you can call that super conservative or not up to you, but we just said, look, that's not coming back for the balance of the year. That's what we want to assume for now. With pharma, we've said, based on the visibility we have with those customers, and I've personally spoken to several of them as well to just gain confidence, we're already starting to see the orders released now. It's anyone's guess if it comes in Q2, Q3 or Q4. But again, we've been cautious and said, look, it will come in Q3 and Q4 rather than in Q2, right? So I think that's the dynamics. But it does return the second half of the year starts looking awfully like pre-COVID times. And then when you do the full year math, right, you look at Waters, I mean, you see us on a stack 2-year, 4-year stack basis, reversing high single digits. And Amol already talked to you about the margins. The margins are 30.5%. I mean that's a pretty good business, right? High single-digit, 30.5% margin. So we expect to be able to overcome these challenges for the balance of the year. And I mean this is the best visibility that we had at this point given the conditions.\nDerik De Bruin: Yes. And I mean, absolutely, I mean just sort of looking at it, you've historically gone through a couple of years of like double-digit growth in the business and then it goes to mid-single, then it comes back double digits and then it goes through -- it goes to these processes. So, it seems like the trajectory as we exit '23 would be back to that 3% to 5% growth in the instrumentation business than whatever the Augment is on the consumables business, right? So 7% to 8% in that range, right? That's probably the best way we think about next year.\nUdit Batra: Yes. I think -- I can't give you a moment next year. But just to give you sort of broad strokes at this point, we think that our instrument business is super healthy, right? Is it 3 or is it 5%? I cannot judge, but it's a good starting point. We think our consumables business has been reversing on the stacked and a double stack, meaning 2- and 4-year stack basis on high single digits. Now it seems a bit higher than previous growth rates. And now we've augmented our business with Wyatt, which should add more to the growth rate, right? So that's a low double-digit grower and exposed more to biologics. And you put it all together, I mean instruments are mid-single-digit recurring revenues are high single digit, you sort of end up at a weighted average, which is mid- to high single digits, right? That's our -- that's what we are saying. And remember, we said 5% to 7% growth in the midterm, starting to -- and with more move towards high-growth adjacencies that growth even expands, and we're able to maintain our margins because we are rather careful about how we invest in the business, and it's about a 30-ish percent or 30.5% margin, right? So you start to see the algorithm come back. But with a bit more strength given what we've done on the commercial side, and how we've been adding strength on the consumables placement through e-commerce, service attachment rates, which are higher than ever and then new product -- the new product portfolio, which is completely revitalized. So we think it will be in there or thereabouts, but probably a little bit better given commercial success given innovation and the fact that we have Wyatt, which is a faster-growing business in the segment.\nOperator: The next question will come from Josh Waldman of Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: A couple for you. Udit, I guess, just another follow-up on your comments on large pharma. I think you said you have orders or quotes in hand at this point. I guess, just curious if you could comment on the magnitude of these orders? And then maybe what customers are telling you with respect to year-over-year growth in their budget. And then I guess fee in reference to the full year guide, if the opportunities do convert that it sounds like you're starting to see -- do you think there's upside to the guide? And then on the flip side, if they don't, do you think you have to trend the guide going through the year?\nUdit Batra: So maybe I'll start with the very end and then work towards the front on the pharma customers. Look, Josh, we've done a very clinical analysis on the drivers of what's happened in Q1, right? And we've been super transparent about where they've come from, right, the Chinese CDMOs, the emerging -- the pre-commercial biotech. And those 2, we don't expect to see coming back for the balance of the year, even if there are indications that, that starts to relax towards the latter part of the year. On the pharma spend, we have a significant amount of cooperating evidence that from the field, from my personal conversations, from looking at the data, especially in what we're seeing on commercial perspective. And I'll remind you that we are still very much a QA/QC focused company. So come the commercial volumes continue to rise as they are in pharma, new products keep coming through, we expect to see that spend continue in the way that it has. So we feel reasonably comfortable that the spending will come back for the balance of the year. Again, how it's distributed in Q2, Q3, Q4, it's not straightforward, but we are assuming that it's in the second half of the year. And that brings us to the full year full year guide, which is the 3% to 5% or a 2-year stack growth rate of high single digits. So I hope that gives you color on how we are thinking about the full year and where we see strength and where we have sort of analyzed it and said, look, we are not bringing this back into the equation.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Then Unit or Amol, I wondered if you could comment on how price is tracking year-to-date versus your expectations. I think you previously said 200 basis points this year. Is that still the right way to think about it? Or does the softer demand environment here in the near-term pressure on that?\nAmol Chaubal: I mean at this point, Josh, price is raising a little about 200 basis points based on the dynamics we are seeing in the market. Our teams are doing an excellent job holding on to that. And that's what we are thinking for the rest of the year.\nUdit Batra: Yes. And Josh, to build on the price comment, we expect that the strength that we've built in execution of implementing pricing changes will stay with us. Second, our portfolio, which is really reinvigorated across the board, right? So we've talked enough about the mass spec business in the past and the Xevo TQ Absolute, the G3 QTOF, which now helps customers transfer their methods much better from development into QA/QC or to the BioAccord. We've talked about the impact of our MaxPeak Premier column. So innovation across the board and now more recently with LC with the Alliance IS and also DA for battery applications. We see innovation across the board, and these customers do want these products. They meet very significant unmet needs, and they're willing to pay a premium to access these products. So the commercial strength that we've built over the last 2 years plus the revitalized portfolio makes us confident that we can continue to pass on price in a very significant way.\nOperator: The next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: So 1 here on instrument. Declined 3% during the quarter, but you made a comment how the dynamics really started late on in the quarter. So can you walk us through what was the exit rate for instruments? And then how have orders looked during April, May time frame? And then as a follow-up, you mentioned that instruments are expected to be flat or low single digits for the year. So what's embedded in that guide for instrument growth during 2Q.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Rachel, thanks for your question. Look, instrument sales declined about 4% for this quarter, right, and on the back of the 26% in Q1 2022. Mass spec, as I mentioned earlier, grew high teens and DA grew double digits, while LC is the 1 that declined in teens. And to your question, on how these were and where this came from. I mean it's the same drivers that I mentioned earlier, they were impacted disproportionately by the decline in the Chinese CDMO customers who are serving U.S. and European pharma companies, pre-commercial biotech and some delayed orders in large pharma. As we think about the full year, we feel quite confident that the deferred business is going to come back given what I mentioned to the -- in response to the previous questions and also the fact that we have an excellent commercial organization and a new portfolio that basically allow us to place these instruments. For the full year, we are assuming a flat to low single-digit growth in instruments and of course, high single digits for consumables. And you'll start to see, to Derik's question earlier, the second half of the year look awfully like pre-COVID times. I hope that gives you clarity.\nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: Yes. And then just a follow-up here on biological analytical characterization. Can you just talk about what the adoption of that portfolio is BioAccord and then also how Wyatt adoption rate has trended in recent months? You talked about the opportunity here for bioanalytical characters is that adoption rates will increase over time. But just given that characterization isn't required for bioprocessing right now, is there risk that to be an area where pharma really starts to rationalize spending and that, that could pressure new customer wins? And then ultimately, what could that do for growth rate for BioAccord and Wyatt this year?\nUdit Batra: So Rachel, thanks for that question. Look, I mean, about 40% to 50% of the pharma pipeline is now biologics. A good portion of that is cell and gene therapy molecules, which are curative, not just treatments. These are fantastic drugs. And we're doing all we can to help our customers take these to the market. Unfortunately, the characterization techniques for these have not moved at the pace that they should have historically. Now we have the tools like LCMS, like LCU, like light scattering that -- and like our MaxPeak Premier Columns that will allow our customers to characterize these molecules much better to move them faster to the pipeline and reduce costs. dramatically. So we see that demand really, really picking up, right? So when we did the analysis, we said, look, this is about a $1.8 billion market that is growing well into the double digits. Now with the addition of yet, we now have a world-class portfolio with the simplest LCMS instrument in Biocad that has very good adoption for raw material testing for in-process characterization of cell lines and now rapidly moving into QA/QC. And I've given some examples of that also in the past. Second, LC/UV remains a characterization technique that many of our customers use to release biologics. And thirdly, now with Wyatt multi-angle light scattering that we now intend to attach to our SEC malls -- our SEC columns as well as our LCs. We think this has very, very good prospects going forward. And when you talk about wired, it has historically grown in the 20% range. And our assumption is -- as we look at the balance of the year and the rest and after the deal is closed, we -- our assumption is still that it's a low double-digit grower with a 40% margin for the foreseeable future. So we feel very good about this area and biologics in general and the business that we're building in bioanalytical characterization.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I guess, first on pre-commercial biotech. Can you talk a little bit about how that trended throughout the quarter? Did the weakness mostly stem later on in the quarter in February and March? Or was it kind of even throughout? And then I have 1 follow-up.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Look, I mean, this really came in the month of March, right? I mean our pre-commercial biotech, as I said before, is roughly 5% to 7% of our overall pharma business, and largely focused in the U.S. and in China. Now to double-click on the U.S., these companies are mostly in the Cambridge and San Diego, San Francisco area, right? And we saw really their spending almost halt in March, given the financial crisis that many of the companies were going through. Some of that has started to release, but we saw that segment really slowed down quite dramatically in the month of March. And then that has -- that has persisted into -- we are assuming that, that is persisting into Q2, especially for that particular segment.\nOperator: And that was our final question for today. I'll turn it back over to the speakers for closing remarks.\nUdit Batra: Sure. Thank you very much for your participation and questions today. And on behalf of the entire management team at Waters, I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in the company. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. .\nOperator: Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. For this morning, I'll start by giving you color on our first quarter results, as well as our updated guidance. Then I will cover some of our recent product launches, including Alliance iS, and I will also provide an update on Wyatt. Our first quarter results were below our expectations with revenue growth of 3% on a constant currency basis, versus our expected 4% to 6% growth. This was largely driven by weaker-than-expected demand for instruments in biotech and pharma, which I will cover in a moment. As you know, we had an extraordinary Q1 last year with 16% constant currency growth. Even though our first quarter this year was slower than expected, it still represents a very healthy two-year stack growth of approximately 9.4%. We also saw good overall strength in our recurring revenues, which continued to grow in the high single digits, as well as mass spec and DA, both of which grew double digits. Our end markets remain resilient, and our leadership team continues to drive strong commercial execution. We have further strengthened our revitalized portfolio with a steady stream of innovative new products. Finally, we've added M&A to our growth strategy with our pending acquisition of Wyatt. And we continue to invest organically in our high growth adjacencies, which are also on track and are gaining momentum. Reviewing our first quarter results in more detail; our performance was impacted by a combination of three factors. First, China was weaker than anticipated as pharma customers scaled back purchases. Second, while we have limited exposure to pre-commercial biotech, we have seen a pronounced scale back in demand from these customers as they have significantly reduced spending to conserve capital. And third, several of our large to medium-sized pharma customers delayed timing of instrument orders due to macroeconomic caution. Each of these dynamics occurred late in the quarter and led to instruments declining 3% after they grew over 25% in the first quarter of last year. By end market, the impact was to our pharma business, which declined 4% overall. This was offset by strength in the academic and government segment, which grew 45%, and industrial, which grew 3%, while our recurring revenues remained strong across service and chemistry. As a result of this lower-than-expected volume, our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted shares also came below our expectations at $2.49 for the first quarter. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. As we look ahead, we are assuming that spending among pharma customers in China will remain scaled back for the balance of the year and while our exposure to pre-commercial biotech is low, we also believe that the slowdown in this space is likely to persist for the remainder of the year. As a result, we're lowering our 2023 guide due to these two factors. We now expect our fully organic constant currency growth to be in the range of 3% to 5%. We believe that large-to-medium pharma-sized budgets remain in place. We expect spending among these customers to catch up and be stronger in the second half of the year after delayed spending in the first half. Despite our revised revenue guide, our full year EPS guidance, and free cash flow generation expectations remain unchanged. We intend to proactively manage our spend and working capital, and Amol will cover this in more detail. Even with short-term market challenges, our sources for growth remain intact. Our end markets are robust, with almost 80% of our business exposed to durable growth areas. This includes demand for QA/QC testing of commercialized medicines, increased scrutiny of PFAs in food and water, and the testing of batteries used in applications such as electric vehicles. Our team has developed a strong commercial discipline that is supported by best-in-class innovative new products that address evolving customer unmet needs. We're also seeing high single-digit growth in our recurring revenues, which are over 50% of our annual sales. Chemistry growth is supported by strong end-market activity, growth in biologic applications with our MAX peak premier columns, and our e-commerce initiative. For service, we're seeing strong pull-through from our instrument sales, and increased service plan attachment is supporting the growth. We expect service plan attachment for our instruments to increase by another 100 basis points this year, building on the 350 basis point expansions in 2019. Our revitalized portfolio has been further strengthened with a recent launch of Alliance iS, which is our next-generation intelligent HPLC system. We believe it is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC in the past decade, and it provides a major leap forward in lab productivity. Not only is the instrument easy to use with its large touchscreen interface, but can eliminate common user errors by up to 40%. It does this by guiding users between steps with a highly intuitive interface. It intelligently conducts a number of real-time system checks before a sample is run. This helps ensure that the instrument is configured correctly for the method that is being tested. Before now, errors such as incorrect solvent or the wrong column being used are usually discovered after the sample has been run, which results in wasted time and a wasted sample. Given the strength of the Alliance brand and the significant new features that this instrument offers, we had a strong reception at its launch. Since quality testing is such a critical component of pharmaceutical manufacturing, customer interest has been strong, including from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, who noted that Alliance iS feels like the future is here and has already made plans to replace a large number of its LCs with this instrument. We now have not one, but two new industry-leading platforms for QA/QC applications in pharma, Arc HPLC and its biocompatible equivalent Arc Premier, and now higher-end Alliance iS, which sits at the top of the range. Last month, we also launched our Xevo TQ Absolute mass spec into clinical applications. Not only is this the most sensitive triple-quad on the market for PFAs detection, where it has seen strong traction in food and environmental testing, but now, within clinical, it is up to five times more sensitive than other competing instruments in the segment. This sensitivity enables clinical labs to detect and measure trace-level analytes at lower detection levels than was previously possible. It also enables clinical labs to expand their test menu to include multiplex panels. Meanwhile, our TA Instruments business launched a new microcalorimeter for battery testing essential for electric vehicle, energy storage and electronics applications. This provides customers with a significant upgrade as it accelerates validation of battery safety, quality and performance testing by up to 75%, which while collecting up to six times more data than other calorimeters. Lastly, we also recently launched a new system monitoring software product on Waters Connect, the first us and unique to the industry. Developed in consultation with QA/QC scientists, it enables real-time monitoring of all chromatography instruments controlled by our Empower software. It helps increase productivity of QA/QC labs by allowing customers to analyze their instrument fleets at anytime from anywhere to monitor uptime, usage levels and real-time system availability. Each of these new products have been developed in close collaboration with our customers to address their most pressing unmet needs. They further support the strength of our revitalized portfolio. Earlier this year, we announced our intent to acquire Wyatt Technology, the recognized leader in light scattering. With more than 80% of its revenues tied to large molecule applications, Wyatt expands Waters' portfolio and increases our exposure to faster growth areas within biologics. It also increases our ability to build a business in bioanalytical characterization, which is a $1.8 billion total addressable market with a 10% to 12% projected annual growth rate. We remain on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We also expect the transition to deliver immediate growth and adjusted operating margin accretion. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our first quarter financial results and give additional commentary on our guidance. Amol? Thank you, Amul. So to summarize, despite a slower than expected start to the year, our end markets are resilient and we expect to see increased strength in the second half of the year. While we have revised our revenue guide, we're maintaining our full year EPS guide due to our robust financial model and the acceleration of our growth strategy remains on track, with continued progress on all of our high growth adjacencies, and with our pending acquisition of Wyatt Technology. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our colleagues around the world who've continued to demonstrate the indomitable spirit of Waters with their focus on strong commercial execution and revitalized innovation. We also look forward to welcoming our future Wyatt colleagues. Finally, I'm proud to share that Waters continues to be globally recognized for its strong ESG profile, placing at number five on the Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies list for 2023. This is the second year that we've been placed in the top 10 after receiving more than 20 awards in 2022, recognizing the company for excellence in product innovation, leadership strength, and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We look forward to continuing to demonstrate our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Caspar. Sure. Thanks, Luke, and good morning. Look, it's a great start to the year with about 45% growth, and this is largely due to the elevated global funding that we're seeing across the globe and the strong demand for our high res mass spec portfolio. This growth was, of course, led by China, which grew over 80% versus previous year. And of course, we saw the same thing happening not to that same extent in magnitude but in the U.S., in India and in Europe, all had a nice growth well into the double-digit territory. So Academic and Government, as you know, is a segment that's rather lumpy. So I would rather not extrapolate Q1 to the rest of the year. So we assume that we will see the second half that will become more normalized and the full year will be more in the low double-digit to teens range given such a strong start to the year. So look, just to sort of take a step back. The full year guide -- for the full year guide, we have assumed 3% to 5% in constant currency, right? And on a 2-year stacked basis, this is still high single digits. We like to -- we think like the first quarter, the spending at Chinese CDMO customers and the pre-commercial biotech customers remains constrained for the balance of the year. And to remind you, on the China side, we've grown the CDMO presence over the last 2 years. We've actually tripled that business, right? So it's gone dramatically up. So we think -- like the first quarter, the spending in the Chinese CDMO customers and the pre-commercial biotech customers will remain sort of muted. On the other hand, we're assuming that the large pharma customers who delayed orders for instruments will come in the second half of the year. And here, over the last 2 weeks, I've personally spoken to several large customers, both in the U.S. and Europe to understand the situation. And the funding remains very much intact, and the POs were simply delayed. So we're expecting those to come largely in the second half of the year. So then the 3% to 5% guide would then imply that for the full year, China will grow in the low single digits versus our previous assumption of high single digits. Pharma will also remain in the low single-digit category with combined pressure from China CDMO and pre-commercial biotech, and instruments for the year will grow flat to low single digits and recurring revenues in the high single digits, right? So I hope that gives you a flavor for the drivers of the full year guidance and how we stepped it down. Amol, do you want to comment on the quantitative aspects. So let me -- so Vijay, thank you for the question. First, on the biotech exposure. Our biotech customers, broadly speaking, constitute between 10% to 15% of our pharma business. and with more heavier weighting in the U.S. and China where the biotech industry is even more developed. Pre-commercial biotech, which is where we saw the slowdown is a subset of this and is roughly half of it, right? So if you do the math, that's roughly 5% to 7% of our pharma business, right, and largely focused on the U.S. and in China. So during Q1, pre-commercial biotech companies, of course, got extremely cautious and virtually halted their instrument purchases, especially later in March. We're starting to see some relaxation but we've assumed that this situation will persist for the balance of the year. And over the long -- over the long term, I don't need to remind you, the biotech industry plays an extremely important role in the innovation that we see across health care, and they remain our very, very strong customers. Now to your question on Wyatt, roughly 80% of the Wyatt business is focused on biologics applications. Wyatt has historically been very strong in academic and government and for biologics applications, we're characterizing large molecules like cell and gene therapy and cell and gene therapy and proteins and monoclonal antibodies. We expect this business for the balance of the year once the close happens to remain in the low double digit -- low double-digit category. And as Amol said, this would add roughly 25% of our incremental revenue for Waters for the rest of the year. So we expect this to continue to remain extremely strong for the balance of the year. Yes. So Dan, thank you for the question. Look, I mean, we spend a lot of time clinically dissecting what happened in Q1 and why it came below our expectations with a 3% or so -- 3% or so growth, right? And the reasons that I outlined the slowdown in Chinese CDMO customers start down the purchasing of Chinese CDMO customers who largely serve US and European pharma customers. We think that will persist for the balance of the year. We think the pre-commercial biotech spending will remain muted. And at least that's what we've assumed, even though we see some signs of that improving, we've assumed that, that remains muted. And then thirdly, we expect the deferral of purchases of instruments in large pharma customers to come back. And we looked at this super carefully, and I personally spoke to some large pharma customers. They have the budget. They have the funding. It simply was caution to delay the purchases. And now with a very strong revitalized portfolio, we feel very good about being able to compete for orders across the instrument portfolio. So you put it all -- you put it all together, you basically see that the instruments are -- instrument growth will be flat or low single digit at most for the full year. Recurring revenues, which have gone from strength to strength is over 50% of our business gets into the high single-digit category. Pharma, which has been our sort of strongest grower in many -- for many, many years. We also assume in aggregate will be flat to low single digits. And China, again, a strong growth driver will end up flat to low single digits. So I think we've been rather cautious about our guidance, and we've taken all the factors into account. And as you said, I mean, the full year stack looks very good, just given the strength we've built from a commercial perspective. and the strong innovative portfolio that we have put forth in the market. And with the close of Wyatt, that should add a little bit of -- a little bit more momentum. The instrument sales for this quarter declined roughly 4%, right? And as you rightly pointed out, this is on the base -- on the back of a 26% growth in Q1 2022, right? So a pretty strong comp. Now mass spec grew high teens. So strength to strength. And on a multiyear basis, it's a high-teen growth. TA grew double digits, while LC declined in teens. Now to your question on LC or deeper question on LC, the sales were impacted disproportionately by the decline that we saw in the purchase by pharma customers, and these are Chinese CDMOs serving U.S. and European customers, as I mentioned, the pre-commercial biotechs and also the delayed orders that I talked about for large pharma. So disproportionately impacting LC. Now just to put this all in a bit of perspective, you see in an instrument business, we will always see fluctuations. And -- but what is important to remember is that over the long term. Our instrument business has grown in a 4% to 5% range with a gross margin of roughly 60%, right? It's a pretty attractive area to be in. We, during this time, looked at our instrument growth rates for the last 20 years, starting to 2004, we basically looked at every year. And you come away with just 2 very simple insights. First, the average growth hovers around 4% to 5%. Second, there is a fluctuation around this mean which generally gets exaggerated around economic slowdowns like in 2008 and '09, 2011 and '12, but the volume always returns within 1 to 2 quarters. So whenever there is a delay, especially in the case of LC, which is over 70% of replacement business, this fluctuation always subsides and you return to your average of about 4% to 5%. So we're pretty positive, and we feel very confident about the deferred businesses coming back especially now given our terrific commercial execution that you pointed out and our renewed portfolio, especially in the small molecule LC segment where Arc HPLC now is augmented by Alliance IS we should see the instrument growth returning back to normal before long. So for the full year, then we've basically assumed still a flat to low single-digit instrument growth in aggregate. And recurring revenues at the high single-digit range. In the second half of the year, you'll start to see trends that are more like pre-COVID times, right? So I hope that gives you a bit of flavor on what the assumptions are and how we've thought about it. So Matt, great question, right? And so I personally then decided to speak to several of the large pharma customers, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And basically, we find that the budgets are still very much intact, like many companies like us as well. We are being more cautious with capital spend, and we are taking longer to approve capital spend, and that's what's happened in large pharma as well. So there is no talk of not doing replacements or not adding instrument fleets that they had planned altogether. Second, what I'll remind you is that our business is more heavily weighted towards the QA/QC segment, which is more proportional to manufacturing volumes, right? And so R&D spend if it comes under pressure, does not impact, especially our LC business, which more weighted towards Q3 and especially on the small molecule side. So really no real indicator there that, that would slow down. And finally, Matt, feel extremely good about our commercial execution that we -- that has demonstrated what we've been able to do over the last 2 to 2.5 years. Where we have really grown rather nicely with all the instrument replacement initiatives also on the consumables side, which remains extremely strong, and consumables, I'll remind you, is an indicator of pharma activity, right? If that is growing high single digit, what you find is there is significant activity still occurring in the -- with the pharmaceutical customers. So we believe it's just a matter of time that the instrument orders that were delayed in large pharma will come back. So we have a lot of cooperating evidence that suggests that this is coming back. But we've been rather cautious, even though we see some indicators of it coming back already, we've been rather cautious to assume that most of the spend will come in the second half of the year. So I mean just taking a step back, Matt, the industrial segment of Waters has dramatically changed over the last 15 years or so, right? I mean, basically, it's now constituted heavily of food and environmental and the TA business has 40% of it is in the more resilient segments like batteries also serving some parts of life science, right, out of the TA. Now to just decompose the results for the quarter. I mean, it grew -- the industrial business grew roughly 3%. It was led by TA again, which grew 10%, almost 10% and PFAS testing, which we've talked about several times in our previous which continues to grow really, really rapidly. And in TA, roughly 40% of the business is now in the more resilient segments with batteries really continuing to grow nicely. So when I double click on TA, I mean it has the same sort of dynamics that the Waters division does, right? So we've really our focus on commercial execution, new products, especially ones relevant for high-growth areas for thermal analysis and geology, and we just talked about our new battery calorie meter that sets a new standard in testing batteries and their efficiency and effectiveness. It's just been launched, right? So we feel very good about where the TA business stands going forward. So if I just put all of that together for the full year, we're assuming a mid-single-digit growth in our industrial business, led by the strength that we continue to see in TA and PFAS testing. That's a fantastic question, Derik, and I expected you to ask something that relates to the history of Waters in general. Look, you're totally right. We think the second half of the year will start to approximate what we've seen in the past, right? That's why if you just look at the growth rate of the second half of the year, it's between 4% and 7%. Instruments now starting to traverse into the low to mid-single digits and consumables well above our historical averages reversing at the high single digit, right? So it does start to look like historical patterns. And if you just now look at the specifics, right, as I said, we basically said, look, the CDMO spending in China, the pre-commercial biotech is not coming back. Now you can call that super conservative or not up to you, but we just said, look, that's not coming back for the balance of the year. That's what we want to assume for now. With pharma, we've said, based on the visibility we have with those customers, and I've personally spoken to several of them as well to just gain confidence, we're already starting to see the orders released now. It's anyone's guess if it comes in Q2, Q3 or Q4. But again, we've been cautious and said, look, it will come in Q3 and Q4 rather than in Q2, right? So I think that's the dynamics. But it does return the second half of the year starts looking awfully like pre-COVID times. And then when you do the full year math, right, you look at Waters, I mean, you see us on a stack 2-year, 4-year stack basis, reversing high single digits. And Amol already talked to you about the margins. The margins are 30.5%. I mean that's a pretty good business, right? High single-digit, 30.5% margin. So we expect to be able to overcome these challenges for the balance of the year. And I mean this is the best visibility that we had at this point given the conditions. Yes. I think -- I can't give you a moment next year. But just to give you sort of broad strokes at this point, we think that our instrument business is super healthy, right? Is it 3 or is it 5%? I cannot judge, but it's a good starting point. We think our consumables business has been reversing on the stacked and a double stack, meaning 2- and 4-year stack basis on high single digits. Now it seems a bit higher than previous growth rates. And now we've augmented our business with Wyatt, which should add more to the growth rate, right? So that's a low double-digit grower and exposed more to biologics. And you put it all together, I mean instruments are mid-single-digit recurring revenues are high single digit, you sort of end up at a weighted average, which is mid- to high single digits, right? That's our -- that's what we are saying. And remember, we said 5% to 7% growth in the midterm, starting to -- and with more move towards high-growth adjacencies that growth even expands, and we're able to maintain our margins because we are rather careful about how we invest in the business, and it's about a 30-ish percent or 30.5% margin, right? So you start to see the algorithm come back. But with a bit more strength given what we've done on the commercial side, and how we've been adding strength on the consumables placement through e-commerce, service attachment rates, which are higher than ever and then new product -- the new product portfolio, which is completely revitalized. So we think it will be in there or thereabouts, but probably a little bit better given commercial success given innovation and the fact that we have Wyatt, which is a faster-growing business in the segment. So maybe I'll start with the very end and then work towards the front on the pharma customers. Look, Josh, we've done a very clinical analysis on the drivers of what's happened in Q1, right? And we've been super transparent about where they've come from, right, the Chinese CDMOs, the emerging -- the pre-commercial biotech. And those 2, we don't expect to see coming back for the balance of the year, even if there are indications that, that starts to relax towards the latter part of the year. On the pharma spend, we have a significant amount of cooperating evidence that from the field, from my personal conversations, from looking at the data, especially in what we're seeing on commercial perspective. And I'll remind you that we are still very much a QA/QC focused company. So come the commercial volumes continue to rise as they are in pharma, new products keep coming through, we expect to see that spend continue in the way that it has. So we feel reasonably comfortable that the spending will come back for the balance of the year. Again, how it's distributed in Q2, Q3, Q4, it's not straightforward, but we are assuming that it's in the second half of the year. And that brings us to the full year full year guide, which is the 3% to 5% or a 2-year stack growth rate of high single digits. So I hope that gives you color on how we are thinking about the full year and where we see strength and where we have sort of analyzed it and said, look, we are not bringing this back into the equation. Yes. And Josh, to build on the price comment, we expect that the strength that we've built in execution of implementing pricing changes will stay with us. Second, our portfolio, which is really reinvigorated across the board, right? So we've talked enough about the mass spec business in the past and the Xevo TQ Absolute, the G3 QTOF, which now helps customers transfer their methods much better from development into QA/QC or to the BioAccord. We've talked about the impact of our MaxPeak Premier column. So innovation across the board and now more recently with LC with the Alliance IS and also DA for battery applications. We see innovation across the board, and these customers do want these products. They meet very significant unmet needs, and they're willing to pay a premium to access these products. So the commercial strength that we've built over the last 2 years plus the revitalized portfolio makes us confident that we can continue to pass on price in a very significant way. Sure. Rachel, thanks for your question. Look, instrument sales declined about 4% for this quarter, right, and on the back of the 26% in Q1 2022. Mass spec, as I mentioned earlier, grew high teens and DA grew double digits, while LC is the 1 that declined in teens. And to your question, on how these were and where this came from. I mean it's the same drivers that I mentioned earlier, they were impacted disproportionately by the decline in the Chinese CDMO customers who are serving U.S. and European pharma companies, pre-commercial biotech and some delayed orders in large pharma. As we think about the full year, we feel quite confident that the deferred business is going to come back given what I mentioned to the -- in response to the previous questions and also the fact that we have an excellent commercial organization and a new portfolio that basically allow us to place these instruments. For the full year, we are assuming a flat to low single-digit growth in instruments and of course, high single digits for consumables. And you'll start to see, to Derik's question earlier, the second half of the year look awfully like pre-COVID times. I hope that gives you clarity. So Rachel, thanks for that question. Look, I mean, about 40% to 50% of the pharma pipeline is now biologics. A good portion of that is cell and gene therapy molecules, which are curative, not just treatments. These are fantastic drugs. And we're doing all we can to help our customers take these to the market. Unfortunately, the characterization techniques for these have not moved at the pace that they should have historically. Now we have the tools like LCMS, like LCU, like light scattering that -- and like our MaxPeak Premier Columns that will allow our customers to characterize these molecules much better to move them faster to the pipeline and reduce costs. dramatically. So we see that demand really, really picking up, right? So when we did the analysis, we said, look, this is about a $1.8 billion market that is growing well into the double digits. Now with the addition of yet, we now have a world-class portfolio with the simplest LCMS instrument in Biocad that has very good adoption for raw material testing for in-process characterization of cell lines and now rapidly moving into QA/QC. And I've given some examples of that also in the past. Second, LC/UV remains a characterization technique that many of our customers use to release biologics. And thirdly, now with Wyatt multi-angle light scattering that we now intend to attach to our SEC malls -- our SEC columns as well as our LCs. We think this has very, very good prospects going forward. And when you talk about wired, it has historically grown in the 20% range. And our assumption is -- as we look at the balance of the year and the rest and after the deal is closed, we -- our assumption is still that it's a low double-digit grower with a 40% margin for the foreseeable future. So we feel very good about this area and biologics in general and the business that we're building in bioanalytical characterization. Sure. Look, I mean, this really came in the month of March, right? I mean our pre-commercial biotech, as I said before, is roughly 5% to 7% of our overall pharma business, and largely focused in the U.S. and in China. Now to double-click on the U.S., these companies are mostly in the Cambridge and San Diego, San Francisco area, right? And we saw really their spending almost halt in March, given the financial crisis that many of the companies were going through. Some of that has started to release, but we saw that segment really slowed down quite dramatically in the month of March. And then that has -- that has persisted into -- we are assuming that, that is persisting into Q2, especially for that particular segment. Sure. Thank you very much for your participation and questions today. And on behalf of the entire management team at Waters, I would like to thank you for your continued support and interest in the company. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. ."

            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales grew 3% in constant currency. This came below our expectations due to the demand dynamics in our pharma business, which Udit outlined earlier. Waters' division grew 2% and TA grew 10%. By end market, pharma declined 4%, industrial grew 3%, and academic and government was very strong at 45% growth. In pharma, weakness was led by China and the US. In China, we saw customers recalibrate their spending plans, and in the US, our large to medium pharma customers delayed spending due to macroeconomic caution. Our small biotech customers, which is a small portion of our business, scaled back spending to conserve capital in light of more pronounced funding concerns. In industrial, growth was led by Asia, which grew 6%, and the Americas, which grew 2%. In our Waters' business, we saw continued strong growth in PFAs testing applications. In TA, growth was led by thermal analysis and rheology. We have seen continued strong demand in secular growth drivers such as batteries and electronic testing. Academic and government had a great start to the year as elevated funding resulted in strong demand for our refreshed mass spec portfolio. Strength was brought across all our geographies. By product, strength was broad across our high-res mass specs such as Cyclic IMS and our tandem cards such as TQ Absolute. Now by geography, sales in Asia grew 6%, the Americas declined 1%, and Europe grew 3%. In Asia, China declined mid-single digits for the quarter. Excluding China, Asia grew mid-teens with broad strength across our end markets. In the Americas, pharma declined mid-single digits given delayed spending against a tough comp of over 30%. Industrial grew 2%, and academic and government grew over 25%. Europe grew 3% in the quarter with strength also led by academic and government, which grew over 40%. By products and services, instruments declined 3% overall, but both our mass spec and TA instrument systems grew double digits. Recurring revenues grew 8% with chemistry up 10% and service up 8%. This quarter had one fewer day than the first quarter of 2022, which translates to a headwind of approximately 1% for our recurring revenues. Gross margin for the quarter was 58.5% compared to 58.6% in the first quarter of 2022 in line with our expectations. Operating margin for the quarter was approximately 26.8% compared to 30.3% in the first quarter of 2022, driven by sales mix and 120 basis points of unfavorable FX. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 15.4%. Average share count came in at 59.3 million shares, which is about 1.6 million less than the first quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the first quarter was $2.49 in comparison to $2.80 last year. Foreign exchange headwind lowered our non-GAAP EPS growth by 8%. On a GAAP basis, our earnings per fully diluted share was $2.38. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to the press release issued this morning and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2023, free cash flow was $166 million after funding $34 million of capital expenditures, which represents approximately 24% of our sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us the ability to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaning fully accelerate value creation in wealth on attractive adjacent markets. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 173,000 shares of our common stock for $58 million early in the quarter. As we previously disclosed, we have since temporarily suspended our share buyback program for the remainder of the year, so that we can use our free cash flow to fund the Wyatt acquisition. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $990 million, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1. Now, I would like to provide our updated thoughts for 2023. Our end markets remain resilient, and we expect our refreshed portfolio and growth initiatives to enhance our performance. However, as Udit covered earlier, we are revising our growth to account for the scale-back of purchases from our customers in China and the slowdown in small biotech. As a result, we are updating our full year 2023 organic, constant currency sales growth guidance to 3% to 5% excluding Wyatt. At current rates, currency translation is expected to have a minimal impact on full year sales, resulting in full year reported organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 5%. Consistent with our prior expectations, we expect Wyatt transaction to add approximately 2.5% to our full year 2023 revenue growth. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is now 5.5% to 7.5% versus 2022, including Wyatt. We expect organic growth margins to be approximately 58.5% for the year, and organic operating margins to be approximately 30.5%. This is higher than our previous guide due to anticipated cost savings in our core business and an improvement in FX. This now translates to 50 basis points of margin expansion, net of investment in adjacencies, partially offset by an FX headwind of 20 basis points. As we previously mentioned, we anticipate the expected addition of Wyatt in Q2 of this year will be accretive to our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin by approximately 25 basis points. Including the Wyatt transaction, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $40 million. Consistent with our prior expectations, the transaction is expected to add $40 million of additional interest expense for a total of $80 million interest expense. The full year tax rate is expected to remain at approximately 15.5%. Our average diluted 2023 share count is expected to be approximately $59.3 million given the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share guidance, excluding the Wyatt transaction, is projected in the range of $12.70 to $12.90, which is unchanged from our previous guide, and includes a negative currency impact of approximately one percentage point at current rates. Including Wyatt, non-GAAP full year 2023 earnings per fully diluted share is also unchanged projected in the range of $12.55 to $12.75. Looking to the second quarter of 2023, we expect the current market dynamics to persist in China, along with the slowdown in pre-commercial biotech. We also expect cautious spending levels from our large pharma customers to continue until end of the second quarter before catching up in the second half of the year. Hence, we expect second quarter organic constant currency sales growth of 1% to 3%. At today's rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately one percentage point resulting in second quarter reported organic sales growth guidance of 0% to 2%. Assuming a mid-May close, we expect the Wyatt transaction to add approximately 1.5% to our second quarter revenue growth. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is 1.5% to 3.5%, including Wyatt. Excluding the Wyatt transaction, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range, $2.60 to $2.70, with a negative currency impact of approximately three percentage points, including Wyatt, which is expected to result in an EPS headwind of $0.08, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share is projected in the range of $2.52 to $2.62. Now, I would like to turn it back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? No, I think you got it, right. Yes. So there are a couple of things, which, that play into the second half of the year, right? One is the volume in the second half is typically higher than the first half, and that produces some degree of volume leverage and our gross margin profile in the second half is slightly better than that in the first half. Two, we also benefit from exchange rate in the second half. Remember, in the first half, is still a headwind in the second half FX is a tailwind. And three, given the revised sort of the demand outlook, we plan to proactively manage our costs and intend to keep our operating expenses relatively flat in the second half versus the first half. And if you are able to do that, then it allows us to produce the kind of margin expansion and EPS that we've guided for the second half. I mean at this point, Josh, price is raising a little about 200 basis points based on the dynamics we are seeing in the market. Our teams are doing an excellent job holding on to that. And that's what we are thinking for the rest of the year."

Now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Amol will then present a more detailed overview of our results and guidance. After, we\u2019ll open the lines for questions. Over to you, Udit.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Our team delivered very strong results third \u2013 very strong third quarter results with revenue, margin performance and earnings per share all significantly ahead of our expectations. Sales were well above the high end of our guidance range as each of our three reported regions returned to positive growth. Strength was led by our Pharma & Industrial end markets, both of which saw liquid chromatography returned to positive sales growth. Together with an improvement in mass spec, instrument growth turned positive in the quarter which exceeded our pace of recovery. We also built excellent momentum as we delivered mid-single digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth while orders outpaced sales for the second quarter in a row. In addition to the positive strength in Instruments, we saw an acceleration in recurring revenue growth which grew a healthy high single digits. This was led by 8% growth in our chemistry consumables portfolio. Within our P&L, our sustained focus on operational excellence led to better than expected gross margin and operating margin results. Coupled with the strong top line performance, we achieved adjusted EPS growth that was over 10% higher than the midpoint of our guide. Results like this in a dynamic market \u2013 in dynamic market conditions take exceptional dedication from all our colleagues. I would like to take a moment to commend our team for their commitment to commercial execution, operational management and innovation. This enables us to deliver enhanced performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. On the subject of innovation, we do made excellent progress and further strengthened our alignment with higher growth testing areas that will augment our future growth. We continue to expand our innovative portfolio with new product launches that solve customer unmet needs in both our core markets and in our high growth adjacencies. Turning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew 4% as reported and 4% in constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.93, up 3% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.71. In the quarter, market conditions and customer spending trends further improved. We continued our path of strong commercial execution and converted opportunities well. We drove strong results as customers were drawn to the innovative new products in our revitalized portfolio. After seven quarters of LC decline, Instruments grew 1% as Pharma & Industrial LC growth turned positive. Mass spec also performed well in the quarter and grew low single digits led by strength in industrial and applied applications like PFAS testing. Recurring revenues grew 7%, led by 8% growth in our consumables business. Breaking out our results by end market, we saw a broad improvement in sales growth as each of our end markets turned to positive growth. In particular, we observed large pharma spending \u2013better large pharma spending where our revenue is tied to QA/QC applications and CapEx spending trends. By geography, each of our reported regions grew. While China was a slight headwind to sales, we still grew mid-single digits on both China and ex-China basis as further stabilization in China posed less of a headwind to our overall results. This is while not yet seeing sales contribution from stimulus. I would like to share more in depth commentary on what drove these strong results. Within LC, orders of Alliance iS significantly increased as our new flagship HPLC product grew to a greater percentage of our HPLC volume. This occurred not just within replacement, but within opportunities tied to installed base expansion, particularly among those in large pharma. We\u2019ve continued to expand capabilities on Alliance iS by adding new detectors like the photodiode array or PDA and by introducing the Alliance iS Bio earlier this year. Alliance iS has already been trialed by most large pharma customers over the past 18 months. With the improvement in customer CapEx spending, we have noticed a notable upshift in the speed of adoption, indicating a promising future for this instrument system. Within mass spec, the Xevo TQ Absolute saw a significant ramp-up in customer adoption. With unit sales growing more than 70% year-over-year, the system was our best-selling mass spectrometer in the quarter. Impressively, it exceeded the combined sales volume of our other tandem quad mass spectrometers for the very first time. The Xevo TQ Absolute\u2019s rapid success has been a three-fold dynamic. First, strength has been driven by continued rapid growth in PFAS applications. We see PFAS testing as a $300 million to $350 million global market opportunity, growing 20% annually. Meanwhile, our PFAS related revenue has grown by over 40% this year. This is attributed to the competitive strength of the system, which is known for its sensitivity in the market. Second, we\u2019ve also seen strong adoption of Xevo TQ Absolute in quantitative pharma applications such as for impurity quantitation. This includes analysis of genotox [ph] impurities, proteins and peptides. Similar to PFAS applications, its value proposition of leading sensitivity together with its sustainable design is resonating well with our customers. It is 45% smaller and uses 50% less nitrogen and electricity than comparable tandem quads. This has opened up new opportunities for us in this segment and enabled us to expand our market position. Third, the IVD version of our Xevo TQ Absolute instrument has seen strong growth within clinical applications after we launched it into that space last year. With its ability to analyze trace-level analytes at lower detection limits, it has been an instant success. It has achieved notable traction across a number of testing areas, but especially in endocrinology and for the development of high value complex tests. This is part of a very deliberate push as we expand the competitive position of our mass specs, consumables and software within clinical testing workflows. In the quarter, total clinical revenue grew low double digits, driven in part by strong sales of the system within the segment. Our results were supported by the strength of our innovation in chemistry. In the quarter, MaxPeak Premier Columns which are relevant for large and more complex molecules grew over 40%. The benefits of our MaxPeak Premier technology are unique to the market and were a key driver of us winning multiple GLP-1 related opportunities. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, our columns have been specced into methods for a majority of the commercially available GLP-1-related injectables on the market today. We\u2019re extremely pleased with how well our chemistry portfolio aligns with the expected volume growth of large and small molecules. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. Margins remained resilient as we maintained a successful focus on operational management. Our gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 59.3% and our adjusted operating margin was a solid 30.8%. Looking forward, we feel very good about our future margin opportunity given our recent success in preserving and expanding our margins during challenging business conditions. We remain on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion this year. We also expect our 2024 result to be a good base for future long-term margin expansion. We also have long-term margin expansion opportunities from our strategic operational initiatives which are focused on areas such as productivity enhancement, cost management and pricing. As we look ahead, Waters is well positioned in attractive markets where testing plays a pivotal role in driving long-term growth. This volume growth is expected to accelerate in the future led by, first, continued growth in GLP-1 adoption within pharma and PFAS-related testing within our non-pharma segments. Second, new volume growth from an increased incidence of drug development and novel drug approvals as new molecules progress through the pharma pipeline. And third, future volume growth drivers for generic molecules are becoming more pronounced particularly due to the aging global population. In addition, a number of key blockbuster drugs will soon be reaching patent expiration. So this gives us a tremendous long-term opportunity for installed base expansion as we sell new testing capacity associated with these growth vectors in years to come. Separately, customer fleets have aged after weak macroeconomic conditions have put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation. This deferral of routine instrument replacement within our existing installed base has created a catch up opportunity that lies ahead of us. Expected instrument growth for 2024 still equates to a low single digit CAGR versus 2019 levels. This is significantly below the 5% long-term average growth rate that we\u2019ve observed on a pre-COVID basis. So looking at the facts, while no two macro environments are the same, instrument down cycles have lasted between four to seven quarters. A catch up in growth has then subsequently followed as new instrument replacement cycle emerges. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of LC instrument decline. Market conditions remain dynamic and it is still early days but our third quarter results and improving funnel trends, especially conversion indicate that we have taken a further step towards recovery. With our strong commercial execution, category-leading portfolio, better pricing levers and exposure to pharma QA/QC, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on these future growth opportunities. Turning now to our new product launches in the quarter. We continued a steady stream of new product launches in our core markets, addressing top customer needs. This includes a high-throughput rapid scan calorimeter that enables precise thermal stability of high concentration biologic formulations. We also launched the TA Instruments compact Discovery Rheometer. This expands our rheology portfolio with an easy-to-use product for routine quality control testing within manufacturing settings such as batteries, pharmaceuticals and food. It offers similar performance to viscometers used in R&D settings but at a price point that is competitive with those in downstream settings. In our high-growth adjacencies, we are actively shaping the Waters of the future and increasing our alignment with nascent higher-growth testing applications where we have a unique right to win. Today, I will share an update on bioseparations. Approximately 50% of the drugs in the pharma pipeline are now large molecules, which includes a wide range of novel modalities beyond monoclonal antibodies that each have their own unique challenges. Given the high future growth potential and significant unmet needs that exist within separating and purifying these molecules, we have directed organic investment to solve these challenges. With the initial progress we've made over the past two years, aligning our overall chemistry business to biologics, approximately 40% of our pharma chemistry revenue now comes from large molecules. As we continue to gear our business towards future growth in novel modalities, we expect this number to rise further, particularly as we now spend approximately 70% of our chemistry R&D dollars on large molecule-related applications. Last year, we launched our first set of in-house developed enzymes for antibodies in areas such as peptide mapping and antibody drug conjugates, which have achieved great initial success. Last month, we expanded our offering further, launching our first enzymes and reagents for novel modality related applications. This includes areas like cell and gene therapy and RNA-based therapeutics such as CRISPR, oligonucleotides and mRNA. We continue to build key capabilities across each class of next-generation therapeutics with the objective of building a comprehensive portfolio that is molecule agnostic and can support the journey of any modality into high-volume settings. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. While market conditions remain dynamic, customer CapEx spending has continued to improve, especially in pharma QA/QC. With our strong funnel, we expect these trends to progress into the fourth quarter and result in 5% to 7% constant currency growth. This is while still making prudent assumptions around fourth quarter seasonality at equivalent levels to last year and well below typical levels. Given our raised outlook for the fourth quarter and better-than-expected third quarter results, we're raising \u2013 we're increasing our full year guide. Our updated full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance is now negative 0.9% to negative 0.3%. We are also increasing our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to reflect our improved sales growth expectations and continued strong margin performance. At the midpoint of our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guide is now $11.77, which is flat to slightly positive versus last year, and is a 1.4% growth rate improvement compared to our previous guidance. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and to provide further details on our guidance. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, sales of $740 million grew 4% as reported, and exceeded our guidance range. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter. This, coupled with our continued strong commercial execution, enabled us to deliver Q2 to Q3 sales step-up of $32 million or plus 4% versus typically a modest decline as we created good momentum. Funnel activity strengthen and orders outpaced sales for the second quarter in a row, enabling us to build backlog. In constant currency terms, by end market, Pharma grew 3%, Industrial grew 7%, and Academic and Government was flat. In Pharma, sales returned to positive growth. Ex-China sales grew mid-single digits with 3% instrument growth and 7% recurring revenue growth. Both small and large molecule applications grew in the quarter as customer CapEx spending trends continued to gradually improve. In Industrial, sales also returned to growth. Growth was led by food and environmental applications, which grew 5%, and chemical analysis, which grew low double-digits. We again saw strong growth from PFAS-related applications, which have been continued growth tailwind within food and environmental applications. For our TA division, sales grew 2%, led by growth in life sciences and advanced materials and chemical applications. In Academic and Government, growth was flat, reflecting an improvement versus the first half of the year, now that last year's tough prior year comparisons are behind us. By geography, all our three reported regions returned to growth, with mid single-digit sales growth in Asia and Europe and low single-digit growth in Americas. Excluding China, sales grew 5%, led by better-than-expected growth in both pharma and industrial applications. In China, sales declined mid-single digits, reflecting continued sequential improvement versus almost 30% decline in Q1 and low-teens decline in Q2. Orders in the quarter were in line with last year, and we expect China sales to return to positive growth in the fourth quarter of this year. On the subject of China stimulus, we continue to have active dialogue with various customers who stand to benefit from the funding announcements made by the Chinese government earlier this year. So far, this has led to improved coating and funnel trends in the region. These opportunities are expected to begin converting into orders and sales in 2025. By products and services, instruments grew 1%, chemistry grew 8%, and service grew 6%. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter of this year has two additional days compared with last year, and three additional days compared with the third quarter of this year. Recurring revenues returned to high single-digit growth in the quarter, reflecting healthy customer activity levels and strong installed base utilization. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth in areas such as service plan attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch of new bioseparation columns into high-growth, large molecule areas. Now I will comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite the headwinds from FX, inflation and the return of annual incentive compensation, our team responded to these margin challenges with strength and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance again in the quarter, with gross margin expanding 20 basis points to 59.3%. Excluding FX, gross margin expanded 50 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 30.8%. Excluding FX, adjusted operating margin was 31.2%. Our year-over-year margin performance was impacted by last year's annual incentive compensation wash back that benefited last year's Q3 results. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.93. On a GAAP basis earnings per fully diluted share was $2.71. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet; we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $179 million after funding $26 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $556 million or 27% of sales, resulting in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 120%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders. With the strong free cash flow generation in our business model, we have made solid progress in delevering our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $180 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.5 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 times. We will evaluate our priorities between further debt paydown and the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year. Now I would like to share further commentary on our fourth quarter and updated full year outlook. While market conditions remain dynamic, customer spending has shown continued signs of recovery, and our team has continued to execute well. We expect these trends to progress into the fourth quarter given our positive momentum, and as increased funnel activity translates to orders. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2024, our constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 5% to positive 7%. This is an improvement in the growth rate expectation versus our previous guidance and calls for mid-single-digit instrument growth in the quarter. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.7%. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is positive 3.3% to positive 5.3%. This guidance range prudently assumes a mid-teen quarter-over-quarter revenue run, employing below typical levels of ramp in the fourth quarter. It matches last year's Q3 to Q4 mid-teens ramp, during which we saw a much weaker than typical budget plus dynamics in Q4. Based on these revenue expectations, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. Turning now to our full year guidance. Given our better-than-expected results in the third quarter and raised outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year sales and EPS guidance. Our updated full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance is now between negative 0.9% and negative 0.3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract 1.2%. Meanwhile, M&A contributions from wired transactions has added 1.3% to our full year sales from inorganic revenue incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total full year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 0.8% to negative 0.2%. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is a 20 basis points expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $71 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.5%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million shares. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our updated full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.67 to $11.87. At its midpoint, this updated EPS guidance reflects slight positive growth versus last year, which is 145 basis points growth rate improvement compared to our previous guide. It includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. So to summarize, we are very pleased with the faster-than-expected return to positive instrument growth. We're also delighted to have observed a notable upshift in new product adoption, which has contributed to our growth this quarter. Our increased full year guidance now has us at positive adjusted EPS growth versus last year at its midpoint as we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with return of annual incentive compensation among the other headwinds of volume and FX that we've described. We're positioned well for the future, with a long-term outlook that is above our historical average growth rate of 6%. This is driven by the associated new testing capacity needed for a compelling set of global volume growth drivers as well as other factors such as price contribution. At the same time, we start to benefit from a catch-up in deferred instrument replacement as customer CapEx spending recovers. The pace of this catch-up will depend on the speed at which the market continues to improve. We are in the early innings, and the market remains dynamic, but we're off to a good start. With our team's strong commercial execution, highly competitive product portfolio and strong margin story, we are confident in our future. So with that, I will turn the call back to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Obviously, early innings on the replacement cycle, Udit, as you noted. I guess couple of questions here. Are you able to talk about the percentage of LCs that are going to customers that have ARC or is it mostly lab that did not upgrade, so effectively a double upgrade here? And then you have the new PEA module, I guess, how much is that helping drive LC sales? And then as we think about the next couple of years, I mean, you mentioned patent expirations, you also potentially have GLPs moving to orals. Like what other drivers should we be thinking about that could potentially help this replacement cycle as it kicks off?\nUdit Batra: Thanks, Tycho, and good morning. Look, I mean, very happy with the fact that instruments have returned to growth. And if you break it down into LC and mass spec, LC after seven quarters of decline and this is I think where your question on the replacement cycle is largely focused, after seven quarters of decline, has returned to growth. This is, of course, on the back of continued strong growth in India, of which where the generic segment is doing extremely well. But equally, with return to growth in our large pharma QA/QC customer segment where LC grew in the low single-digits, both in Europe and in the United States. And another sort of corroborating set of evidence for the replacement at the beginning of the replacement cycle is when customers and we spent a ton of time and I personally did in this last quarter with large pharma customers to understand what we were seeing from a replacement cycle perspective. Look, when the customers start their replacement cycle, they bring cross-functional teams together because this is a multiyear process. They bring in ID; they bring in the analytical labs. They bring in the procurement folks and sometimes finance folks because this is a pretty large spend item, and we have seen more and more of those meetings. Now to your question on ARC versus Alliance, I mean there is an increasing proportion of our LC fleet that is ARC HPLC and now increasing the Alliance iS, which, over the last 18 months has been trialed by each and every large pharma customers. So we feel extremely good with the feedback. And over the last few months, we've added the PDA, we've added the Alliance Bio System, and we have several other ideas to continue to improve its performance. So Alliance iS is indeed playing a part in the discussions. ARC HPLC remains a strong, strong contributor to the replacement discussions as well. We won't break it down any further than that at this point. And to your question on patent expiration, I mean, and I suspect that's referring to India. Look, India has been awesome for us for the last three to four years, gone from 5% of our sales to 8%, largely driven by a strong presence in the generic segment. I mean India supplies roughly 40% of the generics globally. And going forward, we expect at least $200 billion over the next three, four years of patent, sorry, next four to five years of around $200 billion of revenues going off pattern from originators in the next three to four years and more than half of that is small molecule. So we are very well positioned in that segment as well.\nAmol Chaubal: And just to add to that like Udit. As you correctly pointed out, I mean ARC is a meaningful price premium to legacy Alliance, and that has been a very successful product and very accretive from being better priced. And with the value proposition of Alliance iS, it's able to justify even a higher price premium to ARC because the unmet needs that it is solving is resonating with the customer. So that sort of creates that double effect on the replacement cycle. And very early days for PDA, so the PDA version really hasn't produced accretion because we're just launching it. So we will see more of that in Q4.\nUdit Batra: Right, so in a nutshell, the replacement cycle definitely signals for the reticent cycle beginning, some impact already in the quarter and our broader market-leading LC portfolio is absolutely playing a role in those discussions.\nTycho Peterson: And then I guess, as we think about next year, are you willing to make any comments preliminarily, the Street system [ph] was 5.5% organic. Obviously, there is a tailwind...\nUdit Batra: I was thinking that, that would be one of the more \u2013 one of the questions later in the call, but I suspect it's one of the first ones. Look, you know that we won't make any comments on 2025 at this stage. I mean there's a lot that will play out in the next few months. But so not to disappoint you, let me just sort of tell you how we are thinking about the puts and takes, right? So you can start with our recurring revenue. And if you look at especially the last two years, it's like a Swiss clock, right? I mean while recurring revenues in different segments, especially in pharma research, have gone up and down, in QA/QC and late stage for us, this has gone predictably well. So you can assume a long-term historic average, and that's 55% of our business. You start there. Then you look at the puts and takes on the instrument side, right? And so let's first talk about what is rather definite, right? So the generics volume, as we just talked about, will continue to grow. Now don't ask me exactly the percentage of growth, but it's pretty dynamic. Second, PFAS Testing is accretive to our overall growth, and we have a market-leading instrument that is helping us win more orders than we lose them. And GLP-1, you already mentioned that, we have pole position in that with the two largest producers. And as it gets genericized, and Indian producers come in, we think we are very well positioned. So those are things that you can assume are positive. There are two variables that we really need to sort of watch and understand better. The first is how fast as the replacement cycle is going to pick-up. And I've given you enough clues in your first question that it's already happening and the discussions are happening. And the second is the stimulus in China, right? And there, we feel that we're incredibly well positioned given the expansion of distribution, given the expansion of our localized portfolio, we feel incredibly well positioned to capitalize as the stimulus comes in. So I think those are the only two variables that you need to watch over the next three to four months, and there's plenty to happen in the next few months, and we'll talk when we give the Q4.\nAmol Chaubal: Just one thing to add there is pricing, right? Even in this environment, where we are seeing aggressive competitive pricing pressures, we are still delivering on our commitment of 100 basis points plus versus the historic levels, and the proof is in our gross margin.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then just one last quick one on capital allocation. Amol, you talk about preference for M&A versus buyback. You mentioned both in your comments?\nUdit Batra: Look, Tycho, again, something that we won't get into a ton of detail \u2013 a ton of detail on other than what we've said. Look, we're executing on what we told you probably three, four years ago when the transformation started. We said we were going to learn how to play better with the hand we have. This is commercial execution and margin preservation that you saw all the way through in 2023. Then we said we're going to launch new products that are going to be first-in-class and best-in-class, and they're delivering the promise, be it Alliance iS, Xevo TQ Absolute or our chemistry columns. And third, we said we're going to start executing on M&A, which is aligned with our well-stated and clearly stated strategic ambitions, and that's where Wyatt fit in. So from a capital allocation perspective, that's the sequence. We will spend more energy on organic growth. We think we have a ton of opportunities there. If a deal makes sense like it did with Wyatt and it's aligned with our strategy and it's financially very disciplined, we will do it. And of course, we will continue to return value to our shareholders through buybacks, but it's a balanced capital allocation strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Udit, you took down guidance last quarter, taking it back up now. Can you just talk about like which end markets actually beat your expectations? And it does feel like the LC replacement cycle may be coming back faster now than what your base case might have been two or three months ago. Is that a fair assessment? And talk about just which region might be driving that?\nUdit Batra: So Brandon, good morning and thank you for your question. Look, I mean, everything across the board came ahead of expectations, right? So I think you can see that in the print as well. And as we go into Q4 and our sort of guidance philosophy, look, you need to look at it from two different perspectives. One, all the positive drivers we expect that we have seen improve over the year will continue into Q4, right? So through the year, sequentially the growth has gone up and Q3 was 4%, including the LC replacement, we see better signals for that. We see the generics market going pretty well between the PFAS testing that I've just gone through that in the previous question as well. So we see all of those trends continuing. And hence, we've raised the midpoint of our \u2013 midpoint of our guidance for Q4 from a revenue perspective, so it's now 6%, right? So that has \u2013 the trends have given us confidence to raise the guidance. And so on the other side, the second aspect, and Amol mentioned this in the prepared remarks as well. On the other side, it's one data point. I want to see more before we get more bullish. So if you look at the top end of the guidance, what we've done is we tried to keep the ramp from Q3 to Q4 the same as last year, right? So just elaborate a little bit. Over the last three years from Q3 to Q4, the step-up in revenue from Q3 to Q4 usually is about 22%. Last year, we saw one of the most [indiscernible] ramps that we've seen in our history. And we felt was prudent keep that as the other book end of the guide. So while trends are improving across the board, pharma, industrial, any of the portfolio segments feel it's prudent at this point, sort of put it on the book and keep the ramp same as last year.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on China, you have pretty mixed data points, I would say, so far from other peers this quarter. Is the signal to noise ratio from your point of view, getting any better? And how do you think stimulus is order activity quoting, is tracking relative to your expectations right now?\nUdit Batra: So I mean that's a great question. I had a chance to visit China in September, and I have the same questions that you do, and had a chance to visit a lot of customers, see some government officials across the country, not just in one city, and across many customer segments, right? So it was a pretty helpful visit. In all, I mean if you just look at the numbers for a minute, China came in line with our expectations. Orders are in line with what we saw at the same time last year. Sales went down by 5% versus the same time last year, and that's largely due to one shipment moving in the TA business from Q3 to Q4. So that impacted sales, but orders are in line with last year as we expected. Now that said, as the market conditions, and this is something I learned from our team, the market conditions have worsened over the last two years, I mean, our team basically first, of course, rightsized the organization to respond to the conditions. But then we took a deliberate effort to expand our distribution to many more customer segments than we've been historically present in. Second, we localized our full portfolio. So as and when the stimulus comes, we feel very well placed to capitalize on it. Now talking about the stimulus in particular, I mean, you know that the first one was on instrument replacement and the government is now thinking through releasing another one on fiscal stimulus, right? So pretty broad-based encouragement for the economy. We feel very well positioned to take advantage of it. And in the last quarter, I talked about one of the first discussions we had that looked like it could consummate into an order. This was discussions with customs agencies that our government run that has indeed come through. So that order has actually come through. The sales, don't ask me if it gets converted in Q4 or early next year, it's probably there or thereabouts. It's not in our guidance. And don't get too excited, it's low single-digit millions, but it is the first signal that the stimulus is now converting into sales. And as I said, we feel incredibly well positioned to take advantage of it. So in a nutshell, China came in as expected, improving conditions from the first half of the year into Q3. And as we look ahead, we feel incredibly well positioned to take advantage of the stimulus. And it's not just signals; it's actually turning into reality. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi Udit thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the strong frontier. First question, we're seeing varying numbers of instrumentation growth in the peers. I mean you have instrumentation recovering in LC and also MS, an LC replacement cycle is happening, where some of the peers are still saying mid-single-digit decline. So can you take a step back and elaborate a bit about the QA/QC position that Waters has when it comes to instrumentation growth? What do you think is misunderstood here? And on the consumables side, the 8% chemistry and columns number, that was impressive. Could you maybe provide us your thoughts on the sustainability of that? And what gives you confidence why that recurring revenue should continue to sustain in 2025 despite the comps?\nUdit Batra: Let's start with the simpler question, Puneet, and good morning. Recurring revenues for us are like the Swiss clock, okay? You go back in 2024 and you compare our recurring revenues to anybody in the peer group, and you'll find that they're very stable, right, mid- to high single-digits. And so there's not much to say there other than the fact that this is going to continue. And we're fueling it with new innovation, attachment rates and service are increasing. So if anything this starts to grow even more. And as we are at the cusp of the replacement cycle, you will see service revenues improve. So there's nothing more to say there other than just look at the history and the facts, and it's pretty clear. On the instrument side, this is how I would think about it, and I'll try to sort of break it down from a customer segment as well because your question had that piece. First, from a volume perspective, look, there are two obvious drivers, right? The first is generics in India, right? We have a strong position there, and that continues to grow, and it's not just in India, it's also in Eastern Europe and parts of the U.S. that we continue to benefit disproportionately from our presence there. Second is the initiation of the replacement cycle. And here, I'll just take a slight detail and talk about pharma, in particular, and that might explain some of the differentiated results here, right? And basically, for us, we are \u2013 our instrument results, our consumables results are more proportional to the volume of testing in compliant conditions, be it pharma or be it non-pharma. In pharma our stronger presence in QA/QC, testing for marketed drugs, both generics and originators makes us \u2013 makes us slightly different than what you're seeing with the rest of the peer group, right? So that segment is doing \u2013 has been pretty resilient announced the replacement cycle benefits us there. If you now contrast that with upstream, in pharma research we are not seeing the same level of dynamism, right? So upstream where customers have been impacted by IRA, the funding is still not yet going. You can make the same argument for biotech. Biotech, while funding has improved, CapEx cycles have not improved. And finally in CDMOs, we are, again, very well positioned as we look at novel modalities in particular, for our recurring revenues and increasingly for our Instruments with ADCs and oligonucleotides. So from a volume perspective in Instruments, we\u2019re very well positioned. Second, we\u2019ve talked a lot about our best-in-class new products. I mean, we may took a deliberate \u2013 we took on a deliberate effort three to four years ago to revitalize our portfolio. And now you can see the results, Alliance iS, that\u2019s the standard in HPLC testing, augmenting our MaxPeak Premier supported ACQUITY Premier for UPLC, quad [ph] mass spec, Xevo TQ Absolute sets the standard for PFAS testing for sensitivity. And we have just introduced the Xevo MRT, and that is receiving very good feedback from customers for metabolomic testing, where you don\u2019t have to give up speed if you want high resolution and you get it all on a bench-top mass spec. And finally, on pricing, given the differentiated portfolio and enhanced operational execution, we feel very confident that we will be able to extract at least 100 basis points improvement in pricing. So I wanted to give you a comprehensive answer because you touched on end markets as well, but feel very good about where we are on our instrument portfolio.\nAmol Chaubal: And just to add to your absolutely correct insight on the recurring revenues, right? No two recurring revenue portfolios are equal. And sometimes we get penalized because 45% of our portfolio is Instruments. But people overlook the fact that the remaining 55%, which is recurring, when you contrast it with other recurring portfolios in the market. In this down economy, the other recurring portfolios have been flat or even negative growth. Our recurring revenue portfolio as Udit says is a Swiss clock. It has always been between 6% and 8%, typically 7%. And people typically overlook this fact, right? And when you put that together, it sort of gives you so much more stability in the equation.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks for covering that. Just a follow-up on the GLP peptides, obviously, one of the largest categories in terms of volume. And Udit you talked about volume being an important driver. Can you just help us understand sort of how broad is your position there? And essentially, as new molecules are emerging orals and improved injectables, can you elaborate what your position within those are? And just given the volume growth that you can potentially expect in this market. And how to think about this in 2025? I know it\u2019s about 2025, but I\u2019m just wondering how to think about GLP-1s in 2025 context? Thank you.\nUdit Batra: Puneet, you\u2019re going to be super popular with your peers because you\u2019re asking all the questions. But that said, look, it\u2019s a relevant question. GLP-1s are accretive to our growth. And when you look at our position, in columns, we are the primary vendor specced in for both the two large injectable manufacturers for chemistry. Instruments are distributed between us and another vendor, but usually 60-40 us or slightly more than that, depending upon which one. And third, there are atline testing HPLC and UPLC instruments, where we have the lion\u2019s share, and these are called PATROL Systems for those of you who have been following Waters, who will be very well familiar with it. They are adopted in each and every manufacturing site and each and every line of both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Now to your question on orals, we feel very good about where we are. It\u2019s early days in terms of talking about exactly what spec and what\u2019s not. But we are very well positioned, not just with these two, but with many others who are working on it. Third piece is around GLP-1s in the generic segment. As I mentioned earlier, we have a good position with the generics manufacturers in India and in Eastern Europe. And as they start to bring the older GLP-1s and start to genericize them, we again feel very good about our position there. 2025, I won\u2019t say more, especially on the specifics of what will happen with GLP-1s, but there is no reason to believe that the trend doesn\u2019t follow the overall volume growth that we have seen so far.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, Udit. Good morning to you and congrats on the nice prints here. Maybe one on the competitive dynamics here. Do you believe Waters is gaining market share? Or is this a broader sort of end market recovery? How would you characterize your competitor position?\nUdit Batra: Vijay, thanks for the question. And I mean, having been in the industry over a decade, I mean this is question on market share is always [Technical Difficulty] using two things. And we discuss market share, share of wallet market share. Given that most of our peers have different portfolios in different segments, it\u2019s very difficult to have direct comment other than your own information, which is longitude. So we have information for many years. And I can tell you, we are winning more than we\u2019re losing across different segments. And just to sort of shed some more light why that\u2019s happening. First, I mean, basically what we said four years ago, moved our commercial execution and basically follow each and every opportunity, [Technical Difficulty] system gives us incredible exposure, and our teams have worked really hard in the last two years to maintain and win very difficult environment. Second, we have a market-leading portfolio. We have podium position LC. We have podium position in quantitative mass spec to each other segment that very hard, increasingly developing high-resolution mass spec, Xevo MRT metabolomic testing, and we set standards for column testing [Technical Difficulty] chemistry. So feel very good about the portfolio going forward. So I think from a competitive standpoint, I can confidently say that we\u2019ve been more than we lose [ph]. But if you pin me down and say what exactly is the market share point by point gain, I would need very trustworthy information from each of our competitors to add and subtract. And I\u2019m surprised that people are able to make comments with so much confidence. I think we\u2019re confusing to choose share of wallet and market share.\nAmol Chaubal: And just to add on. We don\u2019t have IMS like data in our [Technical Difficulty], right? The only place where you can sort of gauge [Technical Difficulty] growth outsized towards this market. And for us, there are three vectors [Technical Difficulty] DFAS we are growing twice market, India. We do so much more better than the market, the clinical [Technical Difficulty].\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe, Amol, one for you on this guidance here. You beat the quarter by $25 million, annual was raised roughly by 25. When you look at the sequential revenue math, while I understand it\u2019s consistent with last year, I think you have extra days in Q4. So maybe just talk about the guidance assumptions here in Q4. Is that conservatism or any pull forward of revenues from Q4 into 3Q? Thank you.\nAmol Chaubal: No, no, look, I mean, we want it to be prudent, right? I mean, we wanted to be in line with the ramp we saw last year. Last year, we saw about 15% ramp, which is far lower than typical. What we have guided is 15.5%. We have two extra days in the ramp this year versus last year, and that adds 2% more recurring revenue or 1% overall, right? So call it 16%. So maybe it\u2019s a tad conservative and prudent at this stage in the equation. So that\u2019s on the sales side. On the EPS side, our full year raise is slightly lower than our Q3 beat. And that\u2019s to do with the fact with the timing of spend, right? I mean, we had pullback spend because September is a big month and we wanted to make sure it checks out to our assumptions, which it did. And plus we want to be ready as market starts to recover. And so that\u2019s purely timing of spend. We\u2019re still raising our full year EPS guide. And now the full year EPS guide is slightly positive versus last year.\nUdit Batra: And I think there\u2019s two embellishments. One on the spend. Look, I mean, we are seeing dynamic growth in generics in India, in Eastern Europe, we\u2019re seeing very good growth with the Alliance iS as the adoption improves. We\u2019re seeing great growth in PFAS. We\u2019re not pulling back spending. And so as teams come in, we are really making sure that they have the resources to grow in the future. And then your question on pull forward, no pull forward. You just need to look at the orders and sales, orders grew again faster than sales and backlog has been building. So no pull forward at all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you. Thanks for the questions. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just on \u2013 just to start on China. So in the quarter, what China instruments may be down around 10% is our math. I\u2019m just wondering, did you say what your implied or kind of what your guide is for China in the fourth quarter and for Instruments? And Udit you talked about the stimulus like any way to size what that might be for 2025, and we come up with $70 billion in monetary stimulus being allocated broadly to Instruments and kind of science and tech, is that the number? And any sense of what percent the sector could capture that?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So look, I mean, China for the quarter was minus 5%. Instruments were down sort of high single digits for Q4 \u2013 and again, a lot of it, as Udit mentioned, has to do with the fact that orders were in line with last year. It was just timing of some of the TA-related shipments. As we get into Q4, we are expecting growth to return to China. So it will be sort of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in China, and Instruments will be somewhere around low to mid-single-digit decline. But again, as we said, we have had no major incremental negative news from China since Q3 of last year. And because we had finished shipping last stimulus in Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 baseline for us in China is pretty corrected. Stimulus, I mean it\u2019s hard to say at this stage because the biggest challenge is timing. Unlike last time, this is being rolled out through different provinces. And based on our read, every province is in different part of its journey in terms of getting all the paperworks and approvals together. So still very early days in sort of timing the stimulus as it will happen next year. I mean, it\u2019s inevitable. It\u2019s going to be a great tailwind for the sector, but hard to put\u2026\nUdit Batra: And then, just to embellish this on the China piece, we were in China, September, as I mentioned earlier. I mean, the general sense is, yes, the stimulus is coming. We have many conversations with each individual customer who is looking to qualify. We expanded our distribution as a result to make sure we were in every place where there was a discussion going on. This one would be very dispersed. It\u2019s not one that will be concentrated in two or three big academic institutions. So we\u2019ve prepared ourselves. We\u2019ve localized the portfolio. As I mentioned, we already see the first offer set of orders consummate. And as I said, I don\u2019t know if it lands this year in sales or early next year, it\u2019s low single-digit millions, but it\u2019s a good signal that it\u2019s happening. Very difficult to talk about timing at this stage. I mean that the next three months past will find out a lot more until that time. And I think you talked about the $70 billion, but there\u2019s an equally important fiscal stimulus, that will create confidence in the overall economy, and that will influence the sector as well. So don\u2019t forget that piece of it as well.\nDan Brennan: Got it. And then maybe just as a follow-up. Just \u2013 I know you\u2019ve touched on PFAS and GLP-1 several times throughout. Would you be \u2013 I know you talked about the long-term opportunity in terms of contribution to your growth rate. Would you be willing to size how big those businesses are today and kind of how much they\u2019re contributing today to your growth?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean what we\u2019ve said is both those businesses will contribute about 30 to 40 basis points of accretive growth, and that\u2019s based on purely the environmental side of PFAS. What we are seeing on PFAS is it\u2019s now spilling into things such as food and consumer products, and that would be incremental upside to that 30 to 40 basis points of accretive growth on PFAS. On GLP-1, that assumption is based on what percentage of prescription volumes GLP-1 will be, say, around 20, 30 based on analyst reports. If you look at it in an alternative way, which is what percentage of CapEx GLP-1 will be over the next decade, you get to a much larger number. But at this stage, we would want to stay prudent.\nUdit Batra: Yes. And I mean I think the other way to look at this is you take a visit to Copenhagen, highly recommended, or go around Indianapolis and the number of cranes per square foot is higher than Cambridge, Mass where the biotech and [indiscernible] at its height as well when the biotech boom was going. So it\u2019s pretty serious activity Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just going back to Instruments, and Udit, a comment you made about a catch-up opportunity. How do you see the slope of recovery as we kind of move into next year? And do you have expectations that it could outgrow that 5% historical average? I think it\u2019s interesting to see the replacement cycle kicking in for you, and I think there\u2019s still a lot of questions about how gradual that recovery will be and your comments around catch-up opportunities suggest there might be some pent-up demand. So maybe you could just kind of contextualize how you see this potential recovery taking place?\nUdit Batra: So I think \u2013 thanks, Matt. I mean I think the magnitude is pretty clear, right? I mean you can just look at historical numbers, do the CAGRs that we\u2019ve been doing for so much time. And you can see the magnitude is pretty significant, especially for LC catch-up opportunity. In terms of the slope, I mean, just being fact-based, that can go anywhere from 0.5% to 11% growth quarter \u2013 one quarter to the other for the recovery. So it\u2019s very difficult to predict based on facts. Now you can then rely on two other features. One is the funnels that we have. And there, I can tell you, since March, June and now September, the last quarter \u2013 the last month of every quarter tells you a lot about funnel conversion. It has been improving, right? So we\u2019ve been seeing people say they\u2019re going to do something, they do it. And they say they\u2019re going to do large stuff. They do large stuff. They\u2019re going to do small stuff, they do small stuff. So it\u2019s the funnel conversion rates have been getting much more robust as we\u2019ve gone through. So the predictions become way better. And the last piece is customer conversations, and I delved into the qualitative part of the conversation. We\u2019re having an increasing number of cross-functional discussions with our customers where IT will also show up and procurement will show up, finance will show up. So those are the start of a multiyear replacement discussion where the CapEx is pretty significant for our large pharma customers. And I\u2019m talking here about also non-GLP-1 customers. So I think that\u2019s as much as I can say right now. And as I said, more will reveal itself in the next few months, and we\u2019ll share it at the full year numbers.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Very helpful. And then just when you look at sort of medium-term views on China, just given where the GDP growth has gone from where it\u2019s been historically, how are you thinking about sort of medium- to long-term growth in China given your portfolio and your exposure there?\nUdit Batra: Lots of people way smarter than us have been speculating on this. I think the general sense at this point is it\u2019s a mid-single-digit grower. And \u2013 if because it\u2019s a developed economy, but if you have an advantaged portfolio, in some cases where we do, and you have better execution, you can outgrow that number. So I think that\u2019s as much as we can say about that at this stage. And again, more will reveal itself, Matt, as time goes on.\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you for joining us today and for your support and interest in Waters. A replay of this call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at future events and conferences.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. Participants, you may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. Our team delivered very strong results third \u2013 very strong third quarter results with revenue, margin performance and earnings per share all significantly ahead of our expectations. Sales were well above the high end of our guidance range as each of our three reported regions returned to positive growth. Strength was led by our Pharma & Industrial end markets, both of which saw liquid chromatography returned to positive sales growth. Together with an improvement in mass spec, instrument growth turned positive in the quarter which exceeded our pace of recovery. We also built excellent momentum as we delivered mid-single digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth while orders outpaced sales for the second quarter in a row. In addition to the positive strength in Instruments, we saw an acceleration in recurring revenue growth which grew a healthy high single digits. This was led by 8% growth in our chemistry consumables portfolio. Within our P&L, our sustained focus on operational excellence led to better than expected gross margin and operating margin results. Coupled with the strong top line performance, we achieved adjusted EPS growth that was over 10% higher than the midpoint of our guide. Results like this in a dynamic market \u2013 in dynamic market conditions take exceptional dedication from all our colleagues. I would like to take a moment to commend our team for their commitment to commercial execution, operational management and innovation. This enables us to deliver enhanced performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. On the subject of innovation, we do made excellent progress and further strengthened our alignment with higher growth testing areas that will augment our future growth. We continue to expand our innovative portfolio with new product launches that solve customer unmet needs in both our core markets and in our high growth adjacencies. Turning now to our results. In the third quarter, sales grew 4% as reported and 4% in constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.93, up 3% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.71. In the quarter, market conditions and customer spending trends further improved. We continued our path of strong commercial execution and converted opportunities well. We drove strong results as customers were drawn to the innovative new products in our revitalized portfolio. After seven quarters of LC decline, Instruments grew 1% as Pharma & Industrial LC growth turned positive. Mass spec also performed well in the quarter and grew low single digits led by strength in industrial and applied applications like PFAS testing. Recurring revenues grew 7%, led by 8% growth in our consumables business. Breaking out our results by end market, we saw a broad improvement in sales growth as each of our end markets turned to positive growth. In particular, we observed large pharma spending \u2013better large pharma spending where our revenue is tied to QA/QC applications and CapEx spending trends. By geography, each of our reported regions grew. While China was a slight headwind to sales, we still grew mid-single digits on both China and ex-China basis as further stabilization in China posed less of a headwind to our overall results. This is while not yet seeing sales contribution from stimulus. I would like to share more in depth commentary on what drove these strong results. Within LC, orders of Alliance iS significantly increased as our new flagship HPLC product grew to a greater percentage of our HPLC volume. This occurred not just within replacement, but within opportunities tied to installed base expansion, particularly among those in large pharma. We've continued to expand capabilities on Alliance iS by adding new detectors like the photodiode array or PDA and by introducing the Alliance iS Bio earlier this year. Alliance iS has already been trialed by most large pharma customers over the past 18 months. With the improvement in customer CapEx spending, we have noticed a notable upshift in the speed of adoption, indicating a promising future for this instrument system. Within mass spec, the Xevo TQ Absolute saw a significant ramp-up in customer adoption. With unit sales growing more than 70% year-over-year, the system was our best-selling mass spectrometer in the quarter. Impressively, it exceeded the combined sales volume of our other tandem quad mass spectrometers for the very first time. The Xevo TQ Absolute's rapid success has been a three-fold dynamic. First, strength has been driven by continued rapid growth in PFAS applications. We see PFAS testing as a $300 million to $350 million global market opportunity, growing 20% annually. Meanwhile, our PFAS related revenue has grown by over 40% this year. This is attributed to the competitive strength of the system, which is known for its sensitivity in the market. Second, we've also seen strong adoption of Xevo TQ Absolute in quantitative pharma applications such as for impurity quantitation. This includes analysis of genotox [ph] impurities, proteins and peptides. Similar to PFAS applications, its value proposition of leading sensitivity together with its sustainable design is resonating well with our customers. It is 45% smaller and uses 50% less nitrogen and electricity than comparable tandem quads. This has opened up new opportunities for us in this segment and enabled us to expand our market position. Third, the IVD version of our Xevo TQ Absolute instrument has seen strong growth within clinical applications after we launched it into that space last year. With its ability to analyze trace-level analytes at lower detection limits, it has been an instant success. It has achieved notable traction across a number of testing areas, but especially in endocrinology and for the development of high value complex tests. This is part of a very deliberate push as we expand the competitive position of our mass specs, consumables and software within clinical testing workflows. In the quarter, total clinical revenue grew low double digits, driven in part by strong sales of the system within the segment. Our results were supported by the strength of our innovation in chemistry. In the quarter, MaxPeak Premier Columns which are relevant for large and more complex molecules grew over 40%. The benefits of our MaxPeak Premier technology are unique to the market and were a key driver of us winning multiple GLP-1 related opportunities. As we've previously mentioned, our columns have been specced into methods for a majority of the commercially available GLP-1-related injectables on the market today. We're extremely pleased with how well our chemistry portfolio aligns with the expected volume growth of large and small molecules. Now I will talk more about our operational performance. Margins remained resilient as we maintained a successful focus on operational management. Our gross margin expanded 20 basis points to 59.3% and our adjusted operating margin was a solid 30.8%. Looking forward, we feel very good about our future margin opportunity given our recent success in preserving and expanding our margins during challenging business conditions. We remain on track to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion this year. We also expect our 2024 result to be a good base for future long-term margin expansion. We also have long-term margin expansion opportunities from our strategic operational initiatives which are focused on areas such as productivity enhancement, cost management and pricing. As we look ahead, Waters is well positioned in attractive markets where testing plays a pivotal role in driving long-term growth. This volume growth is expected to accelerate in the future led by, first, continued growth in GLP-1 adoption within pharma and PFAS-related testing within our non-pharma segments. Second, new volume growth from an increased incidence of drug development and novel drug approvals as new molecules progress through the pharma pipeline. And third, future volume growth drivers for generic molecules are becoming more pronounced particularly due to the aging global population. In addition, a number of key blockbuster drugs will soon be reaching patent expiration. So this gives us a tremendous long-term opportunity for installed base expansion as we sell new testing capacity associated with these growth vectors in years to come. Separately, customer fleets have aged after weak macroeconomic conditions have put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation. This deferral of routine instrument replacement within our existing installed base has created a catch up opportunity that lies ahead of us. Expected instrument growth for 2024 still equates to a low single digit CAGR versus 2019 levels. This is significantly below the 5% long-term average growth rate that we've observed on a pre-COVID basis. So looking at the facts, while no two macro environments are the same, instrument down cycles have lasted between four to seven quarters. A catch up in growth has then subsequently followed as new instrument replacement cycle emerges. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of LC instrument decline. Market conditions remain dynamic and it is still early days but our third quarter results and improving funnel trends, especially conversion indicate that we have taken a further step towards recovery. With our strong commercial execution, category-leading portfolio, better pricing levers and exposure to pharma QA/QC, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on these future growth opportunities. Turning now to our new product launches in the quarter. We continued a steady stream of new product launches in our core markets, addressing top customer needs. This includes a high-throughput rapid scan calorimeter that enables precise thermal stability of high concentration biologic formulations. We also launched the TA Instruments compact Discovery Rheometer. This expands our rheology portfolio with an easy-to-use product for routine quality control testing within manufacturing settings such as batteries, pharmaceuticals and food. It offers similar performance to viscometers used in R&D settings but at a price point that is competitive with those in downstream settings. In our high-growth adjacencies, we are actively shaping the Waters of the future and increasing our alignment with nascent higher-growth testing applications where we have a unique right to win. Today, I will share an update on bioseparations. Approximately 50% of the drugs in the pharma pipeline are now large molecules, which includes a wide range of novel modalities beyond monoclonal antibodies that each have their own unique challenges. Given the high future growth potential and significant unmet needs that exist within separating and purifying these molecules, we have directed organic investment to solve these challenges. With the initial progress we've made over the past two years, aligning our overall chemistry business to biologics, approximately 40% of our pharma chemistry revenue now comes from large molecules. As we continue to gear our business towards future growth in novel modalities, we expect this number to rise further, particularly as we now spend approximately 70% of our chemistry R&D dollars on large molecule-related applications. Last year, we launched our first set of in-house developed enzymes for antibodies in areas such as peptide mapping and antibody drug conjugates, which have achieved great initial success. Last month, we expanded our offering further, launching our first enzymes and reagents for novel modality related applications. This includes areas like cell and gene therapy and RNA-based therapeutics such as CRISPR, oligonucleotides and mRNA. We continue to build key capabilities across each class of next-generation therapeutics with the objective of building a comprehensive portfolio that is molecule agnostic and can support the journey of any modality into high-volume settings. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. While market conditions remain dynamic, customer CapEx spending has continued to improve, especially in pharma QA/QC. With our strong funnel, we expect these trends to progress into the fourth quarter and result in 5% to 7% constant currency growth. This is while still making prudent assumptions around fourth quarter seasonality at equivalent levels to last year and well below typical levels. Given our raised outlook for the fourth quarter and better-than-expected third quarter results, we're raising \u2013 we're increasing our full year guide. Our updated full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance is now negative 0.9% to negative 0.3%. We are also increasing our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to reflect our improved sales growth expectations and continued strong margin performance. At the midpoint of our full year 2024 adjusted EPS guide is now $11.77, which is flat to slightly positive versus last year, and is a 1.4% growth rate improvement compared to our previous guidance. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and to provide further details on our guidance. Amol? Thank you, Amol. So to summarize, we are very pleased with the faster-than-expected return to positive instrument growth. We're also delighted to have observed a notable upshift in new product adoption, which has contributed to our growth this quarter. Our increased full year guidance now has us at positive adjusted EPS growth versus last year at its midpoint as we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with return of annual incentive compensation among the other headwinds of volume and FX that we've described. We're positioned well for the future, with a long-term outlook that is above our historical average growth rate of 6%. This is driven by the associated new testing capacity needed for a compelling set of global volume growth drivers as well as other factors such as price contribution. At the same time, we start to benefit from a catch-up in deferred instrument replacement as customer CapEx spending recovers. The pace of this catch-up will depend on the speed at which the market continues to improve. We are in the early innings, and the market remains dynamic, but we're off to a good start. With our team's strong commercial execution, highly competitive product portfolio and strong margin story, we are confident in our future. So with that, I will turn the call back to Caspar. Thanks, Tycho, and good morning. Look, I mean, very happy with the fact that instruments have returned to growth. And if you break it down into LC and mass spec, LC after seven quarters of decline and this is I think where your question on the replacement cycle is largely focused, after seven quarters of decline, has returned to growth. This is, of course, on the back of continued strong growth in India, of which where the generic segment is doing extremely well. But equally, with return to growth in our large pharma QA/QC customer segment where LC grew in the low single-digits, both in Europe and in the United States. And another sort of corroborating set of evidence for the replacement at the beginning of the replacement cycle is when customers and we spent a ton of time and I personally did in this last quarter with large pharma customers to understand what we were seeing from a replacement cycle perspective. Look, when the customers start their replacement cycle, they bring cross-functional teams together because this is a multiyear process. They bring in ID; they bring in the analytical labs. They bring in the procurement folks and sometimes finance folks because this is a pretty large spend item, and we have seen more and more of those meetings. Now to your question on ARC versus Alliance, I mean there is an increasing proportion of our LC fleet that is ARC HPLC and now increasing the Alliance iS, which, over the last 18 months has been trialed by each and every large pharma customers. So we feel extremely good with the feedback. And over the last few months, we've added the PDA, we've added the Alliance Bio System, and we have several other ideas to continue to improve its performance. So Alliance iS is indeed playing a part in the discussions. ARC HPLC remains a strong, strong contributor to the replacement discussions as well. We won't break it down any further than that at this point. And to your question on patent expiration, I mean, and I suspect that's referring to India. Look, India has been awesome for us for the last three to four years, gone from 5% of our sales to 8%, largely driven by a strong presence in the generic segment. I mean India supplies roughly 40% of the generics globally. And going forward, we expect at least $200 billion over the next three, four years of patent, sorry, next four to five years of around $200 billion of revenues going off pattern from originators in the next three to four years and more than half of that is small molecule. So we are very well positioned in that segment as well. Right, so in a nutshell, the replacement cycle definitely signals for the reticent cycle beginning, some impact already in the quarter and our broader market-leading LC portfolio is absolutely playing a role in those discussions. I was thinking that, that would be one of the more \u2013 one of the questions later in the call, but I suspect it's one of the first ones. Look, you know that we won't make any comments on 2025 at this stage. I mean there's a lot that will play out in the next few months. But so not to disappoint you, let me just sort of tell you how we are thinking about the puts and takes, right? So you can start with our recurring revenue. And if you look at especially the last two years, it's like a Swiss clock, right? I mean while recurring revenues in different segments, especially in pharma research, have gone up and down, in QA/QC and late stage for us, this has gone predictably well. So you can assume a long-term historic average, and that's 55% of our business. You start there. Then you look at the puts and takes on the instrument side, right? And so let's first talk about what is rather definite, right? So the generics volume, as we just talked about, will continue to grow. Now don't ask me exactly the percentage of growth, but it's pretty dynamic. Second, PFAS Testing is accretive to our overall growth, and we have a market-leading instrument that is helping us win more orders than we lose them. And GLP-1, you already mentioned that, we have pole position in that with the two largest producers. And as it gets genericized, and Indian producers come in, we think we are very well positioned. So those are things that you can assume are positive. There are two variables that we really need to sort of watch and understand better. The first is how fast as the replacement cycle is going to pick-up. And I've given you enough clues in your first question that it's already happening and the discussions are happening. And the second is the stimulus in China, right? And there, we feel that we're incredibly well positioned given the expansion of distribution, given the expansion of our localized portfolio, we feel incredibly well positioned to capitalize as the stimulus comes in. So I think those are the only two variables that you need to watch over the next three to four months, and there's plenty to happen in the next few months, and we'll talk when we give the Q4. Look, Tycho, again, something that we won't get into a ton of detail \u2013 a ton of detail on other than what we've said. Look, we're executing on what we told you probably three, four years ago when the transformation started. We said we were going to learn how to play better with the hand we have. This is commercial execution and margin preservation that you saw all the way through in 2023. Then we said we're going to launch new products that are going to be first-in-class and best-in-class, and they're delivering the promise, be it Alliance iS, Xevo TQ Absolute or our chemistry columns. And third, we said we're going to start executing on M&A, which is aligned with our well-stated and clearly stated strategic ambitions, and that's where Wyatt fit in. So from a capital allocation perspective, that's the sequence. We will spend more energy on organic growth. We think we have a ton of opportunities there. If a deal makes sense like it did with Wyatt and it's aligned with our strategy and it's financially very disciplined, we will do it. And of course, we will continue to return value to our shareholders through buybacks, but it's a balanced capital allocation strategy. So Brandon, good morning and thank you for your question. Look, I mean, everything across the board came ahead of expectations, right? So I think you can see that in the print as well. And as we go into Q4 and our sort of guidance philosophy, look, you need to look at it from two different perspectives. One, all the positive drivers we expect that we have seen improve over the year will continue into Q4, right? So through the year, sequentially the growth has gone up and Q3 was 4%, including the LC replacement, we see better signals for that. We see the generics market going pretty well between the PFAS testing that I've just gone through that in the previous question as well. So we see all of those trends continuing. And hence, we've raised the midpoint of our \u2013 midpoint of our guidance for Q4 from a revenue perspective, so it's now 6%, right? So that has \u2013 the trends have given us confidence to raise the guidance. And so on the other side, the second aspect, and Amol mentioned this in the prepared remarks as well. On the other side, it's one data point. I want to see more before we get more bullish. So if you look at the top end of the guidance, what we've done is we tried to keep the ramp from Q3 to Q4 the same as last year, right? So just elaborate a little bit. Over the last three years from Q3 to Q4, the step-up in revenue from Q3 to Q4 usually is about 22%. Last year, we saw one of the most [indiscernible] ramps that we've seen in our history. And we felt was prudent keep that as the other book end of the guide. So while trends are improving across the board, pharma, industrial, any of the portfolio segments feel it's prudent at this point, sort of put it on the book and keep the ramp same as last year. So I mean that's a great question. I had a chance to visit China in September, and I have the same questions that you do, and had a chance to visit a lot of customers, see some government officials across the country, not just in one city, and across many customer segments, right? So it was a pretty helpful visit. In all, I mean if you just look at the numbers for a minute, China came in line with our expectations. Orders are in line with what we saw at the same time last year. Sales went down by 5% versus the same time last year, and that's largely due to one shipment moving in the TA business from Q3 to Q4. So that impacted sales, but orders are in line with last year as we expected. Now that said, as the market conditions, and this is something I learned from our team, the market conditions have worsened over the last two years, I mean, our team basically first, of course, rightsized the organization to respond to the conditions. But then we took a deliberate effort to expand our distribution to many more customer segments than we've been historically present in. Second, we localized our full portfolio. So as and when the stimulus comes, we feel very well placed to capitalize on it. Now talking about the stimulus in particular, I mean, you know that the first one was on instrument replacement and the government is now thinking through releasing another one on fiscal stimulus, right? So pretty broad-based encouragement for the economy. We feel very well positioned to take advantage of it. And in the last quarter, I talked about one of the first discussions we had that looked like it could consummate into an order. This was discussions with customs agencies that our government run that has indeed come through. So that order has actually come through. The sales, don't ask me if it gets converted in Q4 or early next year, it's probably there or thereabouts. It's not in our guidance. And don't get too excited, it's low single-digit millions, but it is the first signal that the stimulus is now converting into sales. And as I said, we feel incredibly well positioned to take advantage of it. So in a nutshell, China came in as expected, improving conditions from the first half of the year into Q3. And as we look ahead, we feel incredibly well positioned to take advantage of the stimulus. And it's not just signals; it's actually turning into reality. I hope that helps. Let's start with the simpler question, Puneet, and good morning. Recurring revenues for us are like the Swiss clock, okay? You go back in 2024 and you compare our recurring revenues to anybody in the peer group, and you'll find that they're very stable, right, mid- to high single-digits. And so there's not much to say there other than the fact that this is going to continue. And we're fueling it with new innovation, attachment rates and service are increasing. So if anything this starts to grow even more. And as we are at the cusp of the replacement cycle, you will see service revenues improve. So there's nothing more to say there other than just look at the history and the facts, and it's pretty clear. On the instrument side, this is how I would think about it, and I'll try to sort of break it down from a customer segment as well because your question had that piece. First, from a volume perspective, look, there are two obvious drivers, right? The first is generics in India, right? We have a strong position there, and that continues to grow, and it's not just in India, it's also in Eastern Europe and parts of the U.S. that we continue to benefit disproportionately from our presence there. Second is the initiation of the replacement cycle. And here, I'll just take a slight detail and talk about pharma, in particular, and that might explain some of the differentiated results here, right? And basically, for us, we are \u2013 our instrument results, our consumables results are more proportional to the volume of testing in compliant conditions, be it pharma or be it non-pharma. In pharma our stronger presence in QA/QC, testing for marketed drugs, both generics and originators makes us \u2013 makes us slightly different than what you're seeing with the rest of the peer group, right? So that segment is doing \u2013 has been pretty resilient announced the replacement cycle benefits us there. If you now contrast that with upstream, in pharma research we are not seeing the same level of dynamism, right? So upstream where customers have been impacted by IRA, the funding is still not yet going. You can make the same argument for biotech. Biotech, while funding has improved, CapEx cycles have not improved. And finally in CDMOs, we are, again, very well positioned as we look at novel modalities in particular, for our recurring revenues and increasingly for our Instruments with ADCs and oligonucleotides. So from a volume perspective in Instruments, we're very well positioned. Second, we've talked a lot about our best-in-class new products. I mean, we may took a deliberate \u2013 we took on a deliberate effort three to four years ago to revitalize our portfolio. And now you can see the results, Alliance iS, that's the standard in HPLC testing, augmenting our MaxPeak Premier supported ACQUITY Premier for UPLC, quad [ph] mass spec, Xevo TQ Absolute sets the standard for PFAS testing for sensitivity. And we have just introduced the Xevo MRT, and that is receiving very good feedback from customers for metabolomic testing, where you don't have to give up speed if you want high resolution and you get it all on a bench-top mass spec. And finally, on pricing, given the differentiated portfolio and enhanced operational execution, we feel very confident that we will be able to extract at least 100 basis points improvement in pricing. So I wanted to give you a comprehensive answer because you touched on end markets as well, but feel very good about where we are on our instrument portfolio. Puneet, you're going to be super popular with your peers because you're asking all the questions. But that said, look, it's a relevant question. GLP-1s are accretive to our growth. And when you look at our position, in columns, we are the primary vendor specced in for both the two large injectable manufacturers for chemistry. Instruments are distributed between us and another vendor, but usually 60-40 us or slightly more than that, depending upon which one. And third, there are atline testing HPLC and UPLC instruments, where we have the lion's share, and these are called PATROL Systems for those of you who have been following Waters, who will be very well familiar with it. They are adopted in each and every manufacturing site and each and every line of both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. Now to your question on orals, we feel very good about where we are. It's early days in terms of talking about exactly what spec and what's not. But we are very well positioned, not just with these two, but with many others who are working on it. Third piece is around GLP-1s in the generic segment. As I mentioned earlier, we have a good position with the generics manufacturers in India and in Eastern Europe. And as they start to bring the older GLP-1s and start to genericize them, we again feel very good about our position there. 2025, I won't say more, especially on the specifics of what will happen with GLP-1s, but there is no reason to believe that the trend doesn't follow the overall volume growth that we have seen so far. Vijay, thanks for the question. And I mean, having been in the industry over a decade, I mean this is question on market share is always [Technical Difficulty] using two things. And we discuss market share, share of wallet market share. Given that most of our peers have different portfolios in different segments, it's very difficult to have direct comment other than your own information, which is longitude. So we have information for many years. And I can tell you, we are winning more than we're losing across different segments. And just to sort of shed some more light why that's happening. First, I mean, basically what we said four years ago, moved our commercial execution and basically follow each and every opportunity, [Technical Difficulty] system gives us incredible exposure, and our teams have worked really hard in the last two years to maintain and win very difficult environment. Second, we have a market-leading portfolio. We have podium position LC. We have podium position in quantitative mass spec to each other segment that very hard, increasingly developing high-resolution mass spec, Xevo MRT metabolomic testing, and we set standards for column testing [Technical Difficulty] chemistry. So feel very good about the portfolio going forward. So I think from a competitive standpoint, I can confidently say that we've been more than we lose [ph]. But if you pin me down and say what exactly is the market share point by point gain, I would need very trustworthy information from each of our competitors to add and subtract. And I'm surprised that people are able to make comments with so much confidence. I think we're confusing to choose share of wallet and market share. And I think there's two embellishments. One on the spend. Look, I mean, we are seeing dynamic growth in generics in India, in Eastern Europe, we're seeing very good growth with the Alliance iS as the adoption improves. We're seeing great growth in PFAS. We're not pulling back spending. And so as teams come in, we are really making sure that they have the resources to grow in the future. And then your question on pull forward, no pull forward. You just need to look at the orders and sales, orders grew again faster than sales and backlog has been building. So no pull forward at all. And then, just to embellish this on the China piece, we were in China, September, as I mentioned earlier. I mean, the general sense is, yes, the stimulus is coming. We have many conversations with each individual customer who is looking to qualify. We expanded our distribution as a result to make sure we were in every place where there was a discussion going on. This one would be very dispersed. It's not one that will be concentrated in two or three big academic institutions. So we've prepared ourselves. We've localized the portfolio. As I mentioned, we already see the first offer set of orders consummate. And as I said, I don't know if it lands this year in sales or early next year, it's low single-digit millions, but it's a good signal that it's happening. Very difficult to talk about timing at this stage. I mean that the next three months past will find out a lot more until that time. And I think you talked about the $70 billion, but there's an equally important fiscal stimulus, that will create confidence in the overall economy, and that will influence the sector as well. So don't forget that piece of it as well. Yes. And I mean I think the other way to look at this is you take a visit to Copenhagen, highly recommended, or go around Indianapolis and the number of cranes per square foot is higher than Cambridge, Mass where the biotech and [indiscernible] at its height as well when the biotech boom was going. So it's pretty serious activity Dan. So I think \u2013 thanks, Matt. I mean I think the magnitude is pretty clear, right? I mean you can just look at historical numbers, do the CAGRs that we've been doing for so much time. And you can see the magnitude is pretty significant, especially for LC catch-up opportunity. In terms of the slope, I mean, just being fact-based, that can go anywhere from 0.5% to 11% growth quarter \u2013 one quarter to the other for the recovery. So it's very difficult to predict based on facts. Now you can then rely on two other features. One is the funnels that we have. And there, I can tell you, since March, June and now September, the last quarter \u2013 the last month of every quarter tells you a lot about funnel conversion. It has been improving, right? So we've been seeing people say they're going to do something, they do it. And they say they're going to do large stuff. They do large stuff. They're going to do small stuff, they do small stuff. So it's the funnel conversion rates have been getting much more robust as we've gone through. So the predictions become way better. And the last piece is customer conversations, and I delved into the qualitative part of the conversation. We're having an increasing number of cross-functional discussions with our customers where IT will also show up and procurement will show up, finance will show up. So those are the start of a multiyear replacement discussion where the CapEx is pretty significant for our large pharma customers. And I'm talking here about also non-GLP-1 customers. So I think that's as much as I can say right now. And as I said, more will reveal itself in the next few months, and we'll share it at the full year numbers. Lots of people way smarter than us have been speculating on this. I think the general sense at this point is it's a mid-single-digit grower. And \u2013 if because it's a developed economy, but if you have an advantaged portfolio, in some cases where we do, and you have better execution, you can outgrow that number. So I think that's as much as we can say about that at this stage. And again, more will reveal itself, Matt, as time goes on."

            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, sales of $740 million grew 4% as reported, and exceeded our guidance range. On a constant currency basis, sales increased 4%. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter. This, coupled with our continued strong commercial execution, enabled us to deliver Q2 to Q3 sales step-up of $32 million or plus 4% versus typically a modest decline as we created good momentum. Funnel activity strengthen and orders outpaced sales for the second quarter in a row, enabling us to build backlog. In constant currency terms, by end market, Pharma grew 3%, Industrial grew 7%, and Academic and Government was flat. In Pharma, sales returned to positive growth. Ex-China sales grew mid-single digits with 3% instrument growth and 7% recurring revenue growth. Both small and large molecule applications grew in the quarter as customer CapEx spending trends continued to gradually improve. In Industrial, sales also returned to growth. Growth was led by food and environmental applications, which grew 5%, and chemical analysis, which grew low double-digits. We again saw strong growth from PFAS-related applications, which have been continued growth tailwind within food and environmental applications. For our TA division, sales grew 2%, led by growth in life sciences and advanced materials and chemical applications. In Academic and Government, growth was flat, reflecting an improvement versus the first half of the year, now that last year's tough prior year comparisons are behind us. By geography, all our three reported regions returned to growth, with mid single-digit sales growth in Asia and Europe and low single-digit growth in Americas. Excluding China, sales grew 5%, led by better-than-expected growth in both pharma and industrial applications. In China, sales declined mid-single digits, reflecting continued sequential improvement versus almost 30% decline in Q1 and low-teens decline in Q2. Orders in the quarter were in line with last year, and we expect China sales to return to positive growth in the fourth quarter of this year. On the subject of China stimulus, we continue to have active dialogue with various customers who stand to benefit from the funding announcements made by the Chinese government earlier this year. So far, this has led to improved coating and funnel trends in the region. These opportunities are expected to begin converting into orders and sales in 2025. By products and services, instruments grew 1%, chemistry grew 8%, and service grew 6%. There was no change in number of days versus the prior year quarter. The fourth quarter of this year has two additional days compared with last year, and three additional days compared with the third quarter of this year. Recurring revenues returned to high single-digit growth in the quarter, reflecting healthy customer activity levels and strong installed base utilization. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth in areas such as service plan attachment, e-commerce adoption and launch of new bioseparation columns into high-growth, large molecule areas. Now I will comment on our third quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite the headwinds from FX, inflation and the return of annual incentive compensation, our team responded to these margin challenges with strength and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance again in the quarter, with gross margin expanding 20 basis points to 59.3%. Excluding FX, gross margin expanded 50 basis points. Adjusted operating margin was 30.8%. Excluding FX, adjusted operating margin was 31.2%. Our year-over-year margin performance was impacted by last year's annual incentive compensation wash back that benefited last year's Q3 results. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.93. On a GAAP basis earnings per fully diluted share was $2.71. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet; we define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures, and excludes special items. In the third quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $179 million after funding $26 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $556 million or 27% of sales, resulting in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 120%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders. With the strong free cash flow generation in our business model, we have made solid progress in delevering our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $180 million. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.5 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 times. We will evaluate our priorities between further debt paydown and the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year. Now I would like to share further commentary on our fourth quarter and updated full year outlook. While market conditions remain dynamic, customer spending has shown continued signs of recovery, and our team has continued to execute well. We expect these trends to progress into the fourth quarter given our positive momentum, and as increased funnel activity translates to orders. Looking to the fourth quarter of 2024, our constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 5% to positive 7%. This is an improvement in the growth rate expectation versus our previous guidance and calls for mid-single-digit instrument growth in the quarter. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.7%. Therefore, our total fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance is positive 3.3% to positive 5.3%. This guidance range prudently assumes a mid-teen quarter-over-quarter revenue run, employing below typical levels of ramp in the fourth quarter. It matches last year's Q3 to Q4 mid-teens ramp, during which we saw a much weaker than typical budget plus dynamics in Q4. Based on these revenue expectations, fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.10, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 3 percentage points at current FX rates. Turning now to our full year guidance. Given our better-than-expected results in the third quarter and raised outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our full year sales and EPS guidance. Our updated full year 2024 organic constant currency sales growth guidance is now between negative 0.9% and negative 0.3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract 1.2%. Meanwhile, M&A contributions from wired transactions has added 1.3% to our full year sales from inorganic revenue incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total full year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 0.8% to negative 0.2%. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is a 20 basis points expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $71 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.5%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.5 million shares. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our updated full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.67 to $11.87. At its midpoint, this updated EPS guidance reflects slight positive growth versus last year, which is 145 basis points growth rate improvement compared to our previous guide. It includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit? And just to add to that like Udit. As you correctly pointed out, I mean ARC is a meaningful price premium to legacy Alliance, and that has been a very successful product and very accretive from being better priced. And with the value proposition of Alliance iS, it's able to justify even a higher price premium to ARC because the unmet needs that it is solving is resonating with the customer. So that sort of creates that double effect on the replacement cycle. And very early days for PDA, so the PDA version really hasn't produced accretion because we're just launching it. So we will see more of that in Q4. Just one thing to add there is pricing, right? Even in this environment, where we are seeing aggressive competitive pricing pressures, we are still delivering on our commitment of 100 basis points plus versus the historic levels, and the proof is in our gross margin. And just to add to your absolutely correct insight on the recurring revenues, right? No two recurring revenue portfolios are equal. And sometimes we get penalized because 45% of our portfolio is Instruments. But people overlook the fact that the remaining 55%, which is recurring, when you contrast it with other recurring portfolios in the market. In this down economy, the other recurring portfolios have been flat or even negative growth. Our recurring revenue portfolio as Udit says is a Swiss clock. It has always been between 6% and 8%, typically 7%. And people typically overlook this fact, right? And when you put that together, it sort of gives you so much more stability in the equation. And just to add on. We don't have IMS like data in our [Technical Difficulty], right? The only place where you can sort of gauge [Technical Difficulty] growth outsized towards this market. And for us, there are three vectors [Technical Difficulty] DFAS we are growing twice market, India. We do so much more better than the market, the clinical [Technical Difficulty]. No, no, look, I mean, we want it to be prudent, right? I mean, we wanted to be in line with the ramp we saw last year. Last year, we saw about 15% ramp, which is far lower than typical. What we have guided is 15.5%. We have two extra days in the ramp this year versus last year, and that adds 2% more recurring revenue or 1% overall, right? So call it 16%. So maybe it's a tad conservative and prudent at this stage in the equation. So that's on the sales side. On the EPS side, our full year raise is slightly lower than our Q3 beat. And that's to do with the fact with the timing of spend, right? I mean, we had pullback spend because September is a big month and we wanted to make sure it checks out to our assumptions, which it did. And plus we want to be ready as market starts to recover. And so that's purely timing of spend. We're still raising our full year EPS guide. And now the full year EPS guide is slightly positive versus last year. Yes. So look, I mean, China for the quarter was minus 5%. Instruments were down sort of high single digits for Q4 \u2013 and again, a lot of it, as Udit mentioned, has to do with the fact that orders were in line with last year. It was just timing of some of the TA-related shipments. As we get into Q4, we are expecting growth to return to China. So it will be sort of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in China, and Instruments will be somewhere around low to mid-single-digit decline. But again, as we said, we have had no major incremental negative news from China since Q3 of last year. And because we had finished shipping last stimulus in Q2 of last year, Q3, Q4 baseline for us in China is pretty corrected. Stimulus, I mean it's hard to say at this stage because the biggest challenge is timing. Unlike last time, this is being rolled out through different provinces. And based on our read, every province is in different part of its journey in terms of getting all the paperworks and approvals together. So still very early days in sort of timing the stimulus as it will happen next year. I mean, it's inevitable. It's going to be a great tailwind for the sector, but hard to put... Yes. I mean what we've said is both those businesses will contribute about 30 to 40 basis points of accretive growth, and that's based on purely the environmental side of PFAS. What we are seeing on PFAS is it's now spilling into things such as food and consumer products, and that would be incremental upside to that 30 to 40 basis points of accretive growth on PFAS. On GLP-1, that assumption is based on what percentage of prescription volumes GLP-1 will be, say, around 20, 30 based on analyst reports. If you look at it in an alternative way, which is what percentage of CapEx GLP-1 will be over the next decade, you get to a much larger number. But at this stage, we would want to stay prudent."

Over to you, Udit.\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We achieved strong results in the second quarter that exceeded both our top-line and bottom-line reported guidance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their dedication to commercial execution, operational management, and innovation. This enables us to deliver differentiated performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. In the quarter, year-over-year organic constant currency sales were 500 basis points better than Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with a strong finish in June. Orders outpaced sales for the quarter as we built good momentum for the second half of the year. We again delivered resilient operational results with earnings surpassing our expectations. This reflects the strength of our downstream business model, progress on our strategic and operational initiatives, and our indomitable spirit. We also continued our steady stream of new product launches, releasing further innovations that address key customer needs.\noperator: Turning now to our results. In the second quarter, sales declined 4% as reported and 4% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.40. Excluding China, sales declined in low single digits. Growth was consistent with our expectations across each of our end markets. Customer CapEx spending is showing early signs of improvement. In China, sales declined in the low teens, which was better than expected. Growth rates improved in all end markets compared to the previous quarter, especially in pharma and in industrial. While the stimulus measures announced by the Chinese government this year are still in the early stages of implementation, we are having active conversations with customers who stand to benefit from these initiatives. So far, this has led to improved quoting and funnel trends in the region. These opportunities are expected to begin converting to orders in 2025. Overall, instruments declined 17% and recurring revenue grew 5%. Wyatt delivered a 2% M&A contribution to sales, which was better than expected. It marks a strong close to the first year following the acquisition, where synergies were delivered well ahead of schedule. Wyatt operates in high-growth markets serving large molecule applications, especially across cell, gene and RNA therapies. Altogether, it should deliver 40 basis points of annualized accretion to the total company growth in the near to midterm. Now I will talk about our operational performance. Margins remained resilient as we again successfully counteracted volume, FX, and inflationary headwinds with solid operational management. Our gross margin for the quarter was flat at 59.3%, and our adjusted operating margin was solid at 29.2%. Even with recent progress, our work is far from over. We have runway towards further long-term margin expansion driven by our strategic and operational initiatives. This includes areas such as productivity enhancement where we have various programs that are still in the early stages. At the same time, our focus on pricing continues to yield contribution that is well ahead of historical levels. Looking forward, we feel very good about our future margin opportunity given our recent success in preserving and expanding our margins during challenging business conditions. Beyond 2024 levels, we expect to deliver a more pronounced impact on our long-term margin performance, particularly when more typical volume leverage returns. In the second quarter, we launched a steady stream of new products, solving the unmet needs of our customers. At ASMS in June, we unveiled the Xevo MRD, which is now our highest-performing bench-top mass spectrometer. It builds on the multi-reflecting time-of-flight technology pioneered by the Select Series MRT, which has greater throughput and a more compact form factor. With up to 6x greater resolution and 2x better mass accuracy than competitive systems, the Xevo MRT sets new industry standards for high resolution at blazingly fast speeds. So far, our customers have been impressed by its capabilities. It will serve discovery and other upstream pharma workflows where it will accelerate R&D times for new drugs. This includes areas such as metabolite identification where resolution, accuracy and speed are all critical value drivers. We also launched the latest evolution of our Acquity QDa mass detector, one of our all-time best-selling analytical instruments. The QDa II provides a 20% enhancement in mass range which benefits routine identification and analysis of large molecules. It also has excellent green credentials consuming up to 70% less energy than competing products. This is a benefit of increased importance to our customers. Most importantly, the QDA II runs on Empower, which allows for seamless regulatory submission of compliance-related data for large molecules. As we look ahead, Waters is well positioned in attractive markets with secular growth drivers where testing volume plays a pivotal role in driving long-term growth. Our full ecosystem of instruments, informatics, advanced chemistry and leading service positions us very well to help ensure the safety of medicine, food and water and batteries in electric vehicles. Along with our business model, the regulated and recurring nature of these applications results in excellent profitability and free cash flow generation. In recent years, we've made meaningful progress in aligning Waters with faster-growing large molecule applications. Now over a third of our pharma revenues comes from large molecules and novel modalities. At the same time, future testing volume is expected to grow faster than historical levels with increased prescription volumes, including GLP-1s and areas such as PFAS testing. With our revitalized portfolio, we are in an excellent position to capitalize on these growth opportunities. Over the past several years, we've launched multiple innovative new products that have enhanced our competitive edge and created better pricing levers. Serving our core -- our next-generation LC platform, Alliance iS serves routine QA/QC analysis for both large and small molecule workflows where innovation helps drive -- helps to drive instrument replacement. It also includes our Xevo TQ absolute mass spectrometer, which is seeing rapid growth in areas such as PFAS testing. Within our high-growth adjacencies, we've launched new products into bioanalytical characterization, battery testing and clinical applications, all of which are gaining traction given the critical unmet needs that they solve. Finally, recent deferral of routine instrument replacement has created a catch-up opportunities -- catch-up opportunity that lies ahead of us. Weak macroeconomic conditions have put temporary constraints on customer CapEx spending for downstream instrumentation. Historically, this dynamic has lasted for 4 to 7 quarters and has been followed by a catch up. Looking at the facts, while no two macro environments are the same, Q2 marks the seventh consecutive quarter of LC instrument decline. Expected instrument growth for 2024 equates to a 1% CAGR versus 2019 levels. This is significantly below the 5% long-term average growth rate. Improving funnel trends are a positive leading indicator that we are approaching the early innings of a recovery and initiation of a new replacement cycle. I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. While customer activity is showing signs of recovery, we're adding caution to our guide. Accordingly, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. As a result, our revised full year organic growth constant currency sales guidance is negative 2% to negative 0.5%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L and deliver an adjusted operating margin of around 31%. Therefore, our updated adjusted EPS guidance is in the range of $11.55 to $11.65. Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and to provide further guidance -- further details on our guidance. Amol?\nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales exceeded our guidance range on a reported basis, declining 4%. Organic constant currency sales also declined 4%, which was a 5% improvement in growth compared with Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with orders outpacing sales. M&A contributed 2% to sales covering -- results in the first 1.5 months of the quarter. This was better than expected as we were able to accelerate revenue synergies as part of our integration. We are pleased that within the first year of the acquisition -- it is already EPS and margin accretive and our M&A execution remains well on track. Overall, FX was a 2% headwind to the second quarter sales. In organic constant currency terms, by end market, Pharma declined 4%, Industrial declined 4%, and Academic and Government declined 16%. In Pharma, sales excluding China declined low single digits, while in China, sales declined low double digits. In both cases, this reflects an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. In Industrial, sales declined 1% outside of China, led by low single-digit growth in the Americas. We again saw strong growth globally for PFAS-related applications, which has been a consistent tailwind for environmental testing. In China, sales declined low double digits, which was also an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. For our TA division, sales were flat, driven by improvement in segments such as electronics, advanced materials, and chemicals. In Academic and Government, growth remained weak as stimulus in China and elevated global funding drove lumpy spending patterns and a tough 21% comparison in the prior year's quarter. By geography, sales in Asia declined 3%, while sales in Americas and Europe both declined 7%. By products and services, instruments declined 17% and chemistry and service both grew 5%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth despite ongoing headwinds from China. Within our service business, we have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points this year with service planned revenue growing high single digits in the quarter. We are now targeting an additional 50 to 100 basis points of service plan attachment over the remainder of the year. Now I will comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volume, FX and inflation. Our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance in the quarter. Gross margin was flat at 59.3% and our second quarter adjusted operating margin was 29.2% as expected. Excluding FX, both gross margin and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share was $2.40. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $143 million after funding $36 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $377 million or 28% of sales resulting in free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 131%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we continued to delever while paying out this year's tax reform payment of $96 million and other items totaling $30 million. As expected, at the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.7 times. As we continue to delever our balance sheet, we will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our guidance for the third quarter. While business conditions showed signs of recovery in the second quarter, we are adding caution to our guidance. As a result, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. Our updated guidance assumes relatively flat quarter-over-quarter revenue progression in Q3 versus Q2. It also implies a weaker than typical budget flush dynamics in the fourth quarter. Despite the added caution, we are still expecting the business to return to growth in the second half of the year. Given these dynamics, our revised full-year 2024 guidance is for organic constant currency sales growth between negative 2% and negative 0.5%. At current exchange rates, we anticipate that currency translation will negatively impact full-year sales by approximately 1.5%. Meanwhile, M&A contribution from wire transaction has added 1.3% to our full year from inorganic sales incurred in the first four and a half months of the year. Therefore, our total full-year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 2.2% to negative 0.7%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with the reduction in our guide. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect full-year net interest expense to be approximately $77 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be 16.3% and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.4 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full-year revised 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.55 to $11.65 and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate that customer spending will remain cautious, but show further signs of recovery. We expect an improvement in year-over-year growth compared to that in the second quarter as previous year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier and has continued improvement in funnel activity translates to orders. Given these dynamics, our third-quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 1% to positive 3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. Therefore, our third quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately two percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. So now to summarize, with our strong commercial execution and continued resilient operational performance, our second quarter results demonstrate Waters' ability to deliver solid results in various market conditions. We're positioned well for the future with a long-term outlook that is above our historical growth rate of 6% as global testing volume growth remains on track and customer CapEx spending continues to recover. I am also proud of what our team has continued to accomplish on ESG and sustainability. Last month, we announced that Waters has become the first liquid chromatography column provider to receive the ACT Ecolabel certification from My Green Lab. This designation applies to more than 40 of our LC columns and makes it easier for scientists and procurement professionals to choose more sustainable lab products. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Caspar.\nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. And that concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions.\nOperator:\nOperator:\nVijay Kumar: One maybe high level on your comments about the progression in the quarter, a strong finish to June, orders above revenues. Help us square what the guidance change, right? I don't think the guide change was a surprise. Is this just a conservatism in light of the strong June finish order momentum commentary? Or how should we inputting of the guide change?\nUdit Batra: First, thank you for the question. I think you sort of answered your own question. We just sort of taking first just a step back and a 10,000-foot view. I mean our approach to guidance, Vijay has not changed as we progressed through quarter-on-quarter, right? So we look at 3 different things. We, of course, look at the facts from the funnel, how the quarter is progressing, how it's ending, then we spend a lot of time looking at history. I mean, there's not that many businesses that have 20 years of data on instruments quarter-on-quarter. So we look at that and the third thing we do is we talk to our customers and see what the sentiment is, how the orders are progressing, how the sales are progressing. So just to take you through that, and sorry for the long answer, but it will give you context on our philosophy and the guide. So on the fact, you're totally right. We saw -- we've seen progressive improvement from Q1 to Q2. Sales have declined less in Q2 versus Q1 and as Q2 progressed, I mean, as you will know, June is a big month for us. We saw significant momentum in June. You'll remember, in March, we talked about orders and quality of orders and we said we'll start to see them convert into sales towards the end of Q2. Exactly, that's exactly what happened. Lot of sales momentum at the end of the quarter in June and equally, orders growing even faster than sales. So we feel very good about where we see the funnels and what we see with the facts. Now historically, when you look at Waters' business, we have the benefit of, as I said, 20 years of data, especially LC, if you just look at the LC business, when it goes through trough, it is usually between 4 to 7 quarters of negative growth and Q2 was the seventh quarter of negative growth. So we are poised for a recovery and we're operating at -- if you just look at Q2 on a 5-year CAGR basis, it's minus 2%. And we're seeing signs of recovery in LC. So we've factored that into our thinking. And then finally, talking to customers, both of those factual pieces of evidence are verified. I spent a lot of time in the quarter in Europe and in the U.S. with large pharma customers, in particular, China is improving. So as we look at the second half of the year, we're expecting to see improvement quarter-on-quarter as we go from 1 quarter to the other. The second half will see growth, as you rightly pointed out, we've just taken our guidance down, especially in the fourth quarter to assume a slightly lower ramp than we would see historically. So just a little bit of caution built into it. I think on a constant currency basis, it's not more than $50 million. So there's a bit of caution built into what we're seeing. And as more data emerges, you'll see us correct that. Sorry for the long answer, but I know -- I'm sure many people have the same question.\nVijay Kumar: No, that's helpful. And if I understand you, what you're saying is, look, we're not seeing anything in the quarter. It's positive trends in the right direction. But from a guidance perspective, you're just derisking it. And it's more from the perspective of being conservative versus having seen anything in the quarter. Is that a fair summary?\nUdit Batra: Yes.\nVijay Kumar: Revenues, I think, were cut maybe 3% below street the implied Q4 dollar revenues. -- EPS roughly in line with -- the Street. So what changed is the implied operating margins coming in better? Is there any below-the-line contribution that's driving Q4 EPS?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Look, I mean, as you've seen us through last year and this year also back in '22 against inflationary pressures. Our team is super resilient, and we are able to defend margin and even during down volume cycles, we're able to expand margin. As we've discussed before, we have a set of productivity initiatives that have a very long runway, and we are able to accelerate some of them and that reflects in sort of how we've been able to expand margin even last year. If you look at the embedded implied margin profile in our guide. Our second half margin is relatively flat versus last year. So there is not any meaningful step-up in the second half versus prior year. The only thing is as we've sort of taken a more cautionary view on the guide, we will see some of the actions that we've put in place already show up in Q4, and that will help us a little bit in Q4. But other than that second half is relatively flat versus last year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan Brennan of TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Maybe just on instruments. Q2 was about in line, right, with what your guide expected down in '17. I think you were down mid-teens. Can you just flush out a little bit LC versus MS? And how are we thinking about the updated instrument outlook for the back half of the year and kind of what's the math to support that.\nUdit Batra: So let me start and Amol can jump in, Dan. So instruments declined about 17% in the quarter, LC was a bit modest than that, mid-teens. -- spec declined a bit more, and TA was around minus 2%, so minus 17% in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing steady improvement as we went through the quarter and the funnels look extremely strong, especially on the LC front. So for the back half of the year, we're assuming that the instrument growth rate would be flat versus the previous year. So overall, second half is flat. And just to sort of go a bit beyond the numbers, and now as I mentioned earlier, the LC replacement cycle now is in the seventh quarter of its decline, we're starting to see across the globe customers initiating their replacement cycle. So we expect that to -- we expect a little bit of decline or flat growth in Q3 for LC, but in Q4, we expect the replacement cycle start to kick in, which is consistent with what we see with the funnels. So quite an exciting time just given the renewed portfolio across all the instruments as a replacement cycle begins, we feel very good about where we are sitting today.\nDan Brennan: Great. And then just China, anything changed with the guide there you were down I think mid-teens kind of in the quarter around what the guide was. And now what are you assuming for the full year? And is the commentary that orders on the kind of stimulus will start in '25? Is that a bit of a push? Like I think I thought I heard you guys say previously maybe orders come back half and then it kind of kicks in '25. Any color on back at our China and then how we think about stimulus impact. .\nUdit Batra: Sure. Firstly, I mean, China came in ahead of expectations, right? I mean that's part of the driver for the beat. I mean just to give you a bit of the facts, I mean, Q1, China declined 26%, in Q2, it was around 10% decline. And I mean, in the largest end market pharma, we went again from about a 25%, 26% decline to what a 10% decline in Q2. So steady improvement in China in the second half of the year has a lower base, but we've kept the full year guide at a low double-digit decline for China, just to sort of watch and see more data. So good things happening in China. And again, when you compare LC growth rate, and this is sort of an interesting fact, -- for the first time in a very long time, China's LC decline was less than the rest of the world, right? So China declined in the high single digits, whereas the overall decline for LC was a bit higher than that. Now as you think of the stimulus, nothing has really changed versus previous commentary. We're spending a lot of time with customers, doing 3 things. One, helping them identify the age of instruments. You recall this particular stimulus is targeted towards instrument replacements, the age of their instruments, their visibility for the stimulus and helping them do the paperwork as they start to submit applications for funding. We think this is going to be -- this is going to impact growth only in 2025, maybe a modest impact towards the end of the year, but would not factor that in.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tycho Peterson of Jefferies.\nTycho Peterson: Maybe just diving in a little bit into the guidance in the back half of the year. So you're guiding to revenues up sequentially from 2Q that's kind of out of line with normal seasonality. So maybe just touch on visibility? And then -- for the fourth quarter, your -- I think in plant operating margins are mid- to high 30s to hit EPS guide. I know you said operating margins are flat in the back half of the year. But what drives that fourth quarter ramp in particular? That seems that in line with normal seasonality?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So I mean, look, Q-on-Q, Q2 to Q3 is relatively flat. If you look at last 10 years, it has sort of oscillated between plus and minus 3%, right? So it's sort of within the range. And what gives us comfort and confidence on that is what we have in our funnel and the activity that is progressing as well as the fact that we built some backlog in Q2. So that also helps. Going to your other question around second half margins. As I said, second half margins are relatively flat versus last year. There's a small difference between Q3 and Q4, one is the prudence in Q3, the second piece is, as we've sort of taken a more cautionary view on the guide, we've put in place certain cost measures that are already playing out particularly around outside services spend, particularly around how we resource certain growth initiatives and you will start to see some of that impact flow through more in Q4 than in Q3. So there is some plus/minus between Q3, Q4, but overall, second half operating margins are relatively flat versus last year.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then the follow-up, academics is only 10% of the mix, I know, but it was down 16%. Can you maybe just talk on how much of that was U.S. versus Europe? And what are you thinking back half of the year as the comps ease there for academic.\nUdit Batra: I think no change in assumption on the academic side. It's such a small portion of our business, Tycho. So really no change from the previous assumptions.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. And I mean you look at it this way, right, like first half of last year, was super well funded between the China stimulus and what was happening in U.S. and Europe. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, pretty much every quarter you will see is like 0.1% growth. .\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Skyes: Maybe just first, you guys have leaned into the CDMO channel in China over the past couple of years, and that's been an area of weakness recently due to overcapacity. Could you maybe kind of talk about what you're seeing in the CDMO channel in China? And is it part of sort of some of the inflection that you see maybe towards the back half of this year into next year or is that going to remain fairly subdued for the balance of this year and into '25?\nUdit Batra: Matt, thank you for the question. I think we were -- we gave a lot of details around this time and probably even earlier than that last year on CDMOs in China, in particular. Really no change from what we saw last quarter, steady improvement on the recurring side as activity starts to pick up a bit from a very low base, right? You'll recall, it's an extremely low base now. but CapEx is still subdued and we have not assumed any improvement in CapEx in the CDMO segment. Now overall, the generics market in pharma in China is starting to get a bit better. I mean this is why we exceeded our growth -- in our growth expectations in Q1 and now in Q2. So steady improvement in China as you go through the year, especially on the LC side, we're starting to see some replacement cycles get initiated there. So CDMO less, but generics a bit more starting to see life there.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. And then Amol, just on margins, you discussed sort of back half and your expectations. I'm just wondering on a longer-term basis. You made some pretty positive commentary about some margin -- longer-term margin drivers going forward. How should we think about operating margin cadence over the longer term for the business? And where are some of the levers to kind of continue to expand those margins as we move through '25 or maybe on a longer-term framework?\nAmol Chaubal: Thanks, Matt, for the question. Look, I mean, there are sort of 3 to 4 broad levers here. One is, our business is structured such that if we grow more than 5%, it produces 50 basis points of volume leverage and that volume leverage largely shows up on the SG&A line versus on the gross margin line. Two, we have benefit from mix as we move to more recurring as well as with the discipline that we've put in pricing, we feel comfortable like we've seen even in these challenging market situations that we are able to do a little more than 100 basis points better than what we've historically done on pricing. And so mix and pricing sort of is accretive to our margin profile. And then a couple of years ago, we started various productivity and operational excellence initiatives that have started bearing fruit, right? Things like procurement excellence, operational excellence in manufacturing, setting up GCC in India, and these initiatives have a long runway, I mean, between these initiatives, we expect to cover approximately 300 basis points over a course of about 8 years, right? So they add up to the profile. So overall, our goal is between the 3 vectors to put about 100 basis points of margin expansion on the board and use about 70 to 80 basis points from these gains to fund higher growth adjacencies and then as we get into sixth, seventh, eighth year, when some of these productivity initiatives will start to saturate, we expect these higher growth adjacencies to start to produce one revenue growth and two, margin accretion, and that will then sort of take over the impact of that productivity initiatives have saturated. Now as we've gone through last couple of years where the volume leverage was not there, in fact, was a headwind, our teams were able to accelerate some of the benefits on these productivity initiatives as well as we took proactive cost actions and got benefit from pricing, which have allowed us to not just defend margin, but also expand margin during down volume cycles and that's where the difference lies, right because people look at it and say, last 10 years, Waters margin has been always sticky at 30% and so where was the volume leverage. And the answer to that is there was always a volume leverage, but we gave it up in a down cycle. And this time around, we like -- we're not giving it up in a down cycle so that we come out much more stronger when the up cycle comes across.\nUdit Batra: Amol has given a comprehensive answer. Just 2 points to summarize the whole thing. One, the teams have great muscle now to expand margins during a down cycle, number one. And number two, the pricing that we see is very resilient, and I'm excited about -- excited about the prospects as we come out of this down cycle given the product portfolio that we have. I mean, it's been totally renewed. We have leading products across the board that customers have had a chance to test during the down cycle. So very excited about what we're about to see.\nOperator: The next question will come from Rachel Vatnsdal of JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: I wanted to follow up on begin Brennan's question around China here. It sounds like LC was a little bit better than expected in the quarter, but can you unpack the performance by end market within China there? And then also on the China stimulus dynamic, we've heard from a few of your peers that they've called out an air pocket related to China stimulus as customers are really holding off and submitting orders -- so can you clarify for us, have you seen any pause in orders from customers in the region? And if not, why have you guys kind of been more immune to that scenario?\nUdit Batra: Thank you, Rachel. Look, I mean, China, overall, as I said earlier, declined less than what we had thought it for this quarter. So it went from 26% decline in Q1 to about 10% in Q2. Across the different end markets, there was improvement across the board, Pharma went from about 26% decline in Q1 to 10% decline. Same thing with Industrial, which was a 20-ish% decline, again, 11% decline in Q2, and Academic and Government, which had -- which still has very high comps went from over 40% decline to slightly less than 30% decline. I mean, the most interesting thing here is that the replacement cycle is starting to show life in China already. We went from over a 40% decline in Q1 in LC, over 40% to now less than 10%, which was better than the rest of the world, right? So we're starting to see customer activity pick up in China. It's still negative growth versus previous years, but it's starting to get better quarter-on-quarter. And on your question on the stimulus, look, I mean, we are having a ton of conversations with our customers as the activity level remains consistent, right? So the activity level has remained consistent. It's actually improving quarter-on-quarter. From a stimulus perspective, as I said earlier, it's a broader stimulus, it's over a longer period of time, and it specifically targets instrument replacement. So we've been spending a lot of time with our customers, identifying the age of their instruments, defining eligibility versus what the government has targeted, and helping them do the paperwork to submit proposals for funding that becomes available. We don't expect that to impact revenue this year. But surely, it will impact what we see in 2025. So overall, improving conditions across all end markets, especially in Pharma, especially in LC, no real sign of what you're calling an air pocket. Activity is continuing at a baseline level, getting better and customers are getting prepared to get funding from the stimulus.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then I did want to follow up on 2025 quickly. So can you walk us through your exit rates at 4Q? You've kind of talked about some of this replacement cycle starting to heat up in the back half. If we learn some of the weaker comps on the China dynamics that you talked about as well, how are you really thinking about that exit rate underpinning 2025? It looks like the Street is currently just shy of a 6% organic growth rate. So just at an early starting point, how comfortable are you with that?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Look, I mean, if we sort of extrapolate our guide and say, where will Q4 and our '24 exit rates will be a good -- even for ex China for LC and MS will be a good couple of hundred basis points below the historic average. And this is ex-China, right? So that gives us a lot of hope and comfort that we are at the bottom of this whole slowdown in the replacement cycle and the fleet out there has aged meaningfully beyond its life needing replacement, particularly for LC. And then China is a twofold equation of when the fleet is aged far more than that but then the question is, when does these generic companies feel comfortable with their status and when do they start replacing and we're seeing signs of that, right? We've had a few generic companies in China already starting to replace their fleet, and we think others will follow over the course of next few quarters.\nUdit Batra: I just want to embellish a little bit on what we're seeing at the end of Q2 that starts to give us confidence, right? June is 1 of the largest months of the year for us. And it has surpassed our expectations, right, both in sales and in orders. So there's a lot of momentum that we've built going into Q3. So that gives us confidence in its a lot in the areas that we've just discussed, right? So it's consistent with an improving trend in the industry. Second, as I said, I spent a fair amount of time with customers, both in Europe and the U.S. in this last quarter, especially in large pharma, customers are now used to the additional steps in the procurement process. In fact, one of the largest pharma companies had introduced several steps in the process, which their internal teams were also learning and we were also learning about, and that sort of -- that gave a little bit of pause to how fast the orders were converting to sales. This time around, when we said in March, order quality is high, like clockwork, we've seen them convert into sales towards the end of June. So now the funnel predictability is way better than we've seen, especially in large pharma and the funnel -- the order quality and the funnel strength is pretty good as we sit looking into the back half of the year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dan Arias of Stifel.\nDan Arias: Can you maybe just refresh us on the picking around the upgrades within this replacement cycle that we're talking about taking place here? And what I mean by this is, obviously, things are still shaky out there on the CapEx side. So when these LCE customers come back into the market, should we assume that there's maybe less HPLC to UPLC transitioning and what you see during historical periods or do you think these upsell dynamics and the conversion to UPLC could be fairly typical.\nUdit Batra: I think it's a great question, Dan, right? And I would look at it 2 ways. One, the HPLC-to-HPLC conversion, right? And that's a robust trend and we have a line of sight on what the fleet is. And there, we offer our customers 2 options, go to the ARC HPLC, which is done really, really well, even during the downturn. And then the Alliance iS, which is now also available for biologics with our premier technology, right? And that has been received extremely well. In a way, the slowdown in the market allowed many of our customers to sample the benefits of Alliance iS, which reduces errors in the QC environment by 40%, which is a significant advance probably the most important advance in the last decade in the HPLC segment itself. So we feel very good on the like-for-like replacement already. Second, when you think of HPLC to UPLC transitions, we are seeing that as well and GLP-1s are a case in point where we see that transition happening. And now on that, let me make 2 comments. One, you've seen that our Biologics revenue as a fraction of overall pharma has gone from roughly 20% to over 35% in the last 3 to 4 years, right? So that has been a very deliberate effort, not just on the UPLC side, HPLC to UPLC side but also in introducing what we call the premier technology, which is tailor-made for large molecules. That is now also available on the UPLC segment, which allows customers to transition the larger part of the pipeline, which is Biologics from HPLC to UPLC very comfortably where now the experimental time is reduced dramatically with the premier technology. So we're seeing both and we are well prepared if the customer decides to remain with HPLC. And equally, we are seeing the trend continue as more and more large molecules and novel modalities come through the pipeline from people transitioning to HPLC to UPLC but there, again, on the receiving end, our UPLCs now have the premier technology, which basically reduce experimental time dramatically. I hope that gives you color into the transition.\nAmol Chaubal: And just to add to that, right, I mean, if you look at our historical instrument growth pattern, the 5% instrument growth has roughly about 50 to 70 basis points of price and 3% of volume, the remaining 1.5 or so really comes from upsell, right? And when we quote our price numbers, their like-for-like SKU and like-for-like geography. So that doesn't include when a customer chooses say, ARC HPLC or Alliance or Alliance iS or ARC UPLC. And in order to achieve that 1.5%, we only need about 7% of these customers to choose an upgrade given the current innovation and the pricing that is out there. And 7%, we feel super comfortable with huge unmet needs that some of our newer launches are directly addressing, which customers are appreciating. .\nOperator: The next question is from Puneet Souda of Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Udit, for you, if I could ask, the June order growth improvement, the significant momentum you talked about in June, has that continued into July as well? And could you elaborate if this momentum is in mostly in pharma, North America and Europe, it seems like there's some -- still some caution on China that's improving. But just wanted to get some more details there. .\nUdit Batra: Great question. And as you know, and I think we've been through this before, we won't comment on July trends but you can assume that June was very robust. Customer activity has been very, very good and that gives us confidence on what we're seeing in -- what we've guided for in Q3. So June has a lot to do with the confidence that we built in the replacement cycle, the confidence that we've built in Q3, the confidence we've also built in the ramp towards -- ramp in Q4.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then an Asia question for you. Just thinking about China, first of all, and then I want to cover just Japan and India. China, just wanted to understand in terms of retaliatory risks for tariffs. If you could elaborate where is your manufacturing position? How much of the business is China for China in case if there are tariffs and sort of retaliatory tariffs in 2025? And then on Japan, I believe you grew -- sorry, in Japan, you were down 11%. In India, you grew about 11% in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about what happened in those geographies?\nUdit Batra: Sure. So 3 questions, right? First, on China. I think we used -- in an interesting way we used the downturn to improve our manufacturing footprint in China, and that is going to help us as the stimulus comes through. We also increased our commercial presence across China. So we feel very good about what the future holds for China, both in terms of local manufacturing, where bulk of our instrument portfolio now is either finished or manufactured in China, and on the commercial side, equally good. Now on your question on India, India has been a star performer for us for many, many quarters. This quarter was no different. We grew in excess of 20% largely on the back of pharma. And there in pharma, LC grew close to 50%, right? And you heard that right, close to 50%. And so that India goes from strength to strength and the Indian government is giving stimulus to like many other countries to their academic and government segments. And there, too, we're benefiting a lot. That segment grew quite rapidly where the funding is captured. And then on Japan, it was a 1% constant currency growth.\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean, look, Japan unit likely are looking at the reported number, right? And you know where Japanese yen has been over the last year, that's like close to 11% headwind so at constant currency we're more or less flat, and that's also sort of the reason why the currency impact for us is somewhat higher and we had to increase it to 1.5% driven by Japan because we have a reasonable Japan footprint. And our team is doing relatively well coming out of the March year-end. So what you see progressing in Q2 and onwards we see healthy demand, and we see good funnel activity in Japan. .\nUdit Batra: Yes. And then just coming back to India. Very excited about the prospects there. As with China, during a downturn, we've sort of figured out where to increase our commercial presence in India, we go from strength to strength. The commercial presence has been increased across the board. We've decreased our collaborations on the ground. And India has gone in the last 2 to 3 years from less than 6% of our sales to close to 8% of our sales. right? So it's becoming a more significant part of our business, and it's growing really, really well.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jack Meehan of Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: So I wanted to ask about kind of the dynamic of instruments starting to recover, but more looking at it from a margin perspective, Amol, I was curious, like just how a changing mix dynamic in the second half of the year and into 2025, what that actually -- what that means for gross margin progression?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Great question, Jack, as always. Look, I mean, there is going to be some negative mix impact from more instruments when instruments start to come back. But as you look at our guide, that's sort of factored in the gross margin, 20 basis points of expansion that we've outlined for the year. And as we go into next year, if the mix sort of returns back to, call it, say, 2019 levels there will be 10-ish basis points adverse impact, but that's largely covered with the productivity initiatives we have in place so the marginal have got to 20 to 30 basis points still remains intact.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Okay. And then 2 just housekeeping ones. The first is any updated thoughts on buyback returning to that. And second, can you just remind us any selling day changes throughout the year in the third and the fourth quarter?\nAmol Chaubal: Yes. So on the first one, right, I mean we continue to pay down debt from the Wyatt acquisition. We are at 1.7 now. So we are at a point where we are actively considering the switch between paying down debt versus buying back shares. I mean, the intention is to gain strategic flexibility as much as possible. So we continue to review options. And on the number of days, I mean, the key thing to note is on Q4 this year, we have 3 more days than Q3 of this year and that partly helps about 1.5% in the ramp from Q3 to Q4. And then other than that, I mean, there are 2 more days in Q4 of this year versus Q4 of last year. Q3 is roughly the same.\nOperator: The next question will come from Catherine Schulte of Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: First, just maybe on Wyatt, it's great to see that coming in ahead of expectations. Are you seeing any different trends in terms of market improvement in that business, just given the exposure to large molecule in cell and gene therapy?\nUdit Batra: Yes. Catherine, thank you for the question. Look, we're very happy with the way the integration has progressed. The synergies are being delivered well ahead of target. That's why you saw growth higher than what we had guided for wyatt itself. And it's, as you know, focused on large molecule applications, which are growing faster than the small molecule applications, be it RNA therapy, be it mAbs, be it viral vectors. We're working closely with customers on increasing applications. What's most exciting is that now the teams are working to take multi-angle light scattering that is the wire technology into QA/QC with basically our Empower software, right and this is really exciting. Now you can imagine that large molecules don't have many different analytical techniques that are in QA/QC. It already has liquid chomatography, to some extent capillary electrophoresis, and now multi-angle light -- all of these now if they are on -- and now the QDA gives us mass analysis. If all of these now, if they talk to Empower allow our customers to submit data to regulators, some very exciting, really good progress on that front, even in a down market, we're seeing good demand for multi-angle light scattering.\nCatherine Schulte: Great. And then maybe just going back to the guidance update. Can you just elaborate on if there are any specific areas of that conservatism that you added to your assumptions? Was it around China, pharma or is it really broader than that? Any further color would be appreciated.\nAmol Chaubal: No. Look, I mean, most of our guidance caution that we've put in place is around our ex-China business. we just caution for a slower-than-anticipated pace of recovery. China, if anything, if you look at last 2 quarters, we've exceeded our expectations. We haven't just been bold enough to sort of then improve the guidance for the rest of the year, but we remain cautiously optimistic that our team will continue to positively surprise us like they have done in the first 2 quarters.\nUdit Batra: It's a great setup for exceeding expectations as we go through the year and it's just the guidance philosophy we talked about at the beginning of the call that Vijay started with, and it's a great place to sort of end the call. I mean it's basically what we've done all along. We look at a lot of data from customers, from funnels. Second, we spend a lot of time looking at history of LC replacement, in particular, which bodes well. And third, talk to a lot of customers on how they're receiving our new products, how their spending and growing and all three point towards a more positive second half of the year than we've seen. So that's all been factored in Catherine. Thank you for that question. Caspar?\nCaspar Tudor: Thank you for joining us today and for your support and interest in Waters. A replay of this call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you. Thanks. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We achieved strong results in the second quarter that exceeded both our top-line and bottom-line reported guidance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their dedication to commercial execution, operational management, and innovation. This enables us to deliver differentiated performance and accelerate the benefits of pioneering science. In the quarter, year-over-year organic constant currency sales were 500 basis points better than Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with a strong finish in June. Orders outpaced sales for the quarter as we built good momentum for the second half of the year. We again delivered resilient operational results with earnings surpassing our expectations. This reflects the strength of our downstream business model, progress on our strategic and operational initiatives, and our indomitable spirit. We also continued our steady stream of new product launches, releasing further innovations that address key customer needs. Thank you, Amol. So now to summarize, with our strong commercial execution and continued resilient operational performance, our second quarter results demonstrate Waters' ability to deliver solid results in various market conditions. We're positioned well for the future with a long-term outlook that is above our historical growth rate of 6% as global testing volume growth remains on track and customer CapEx spending continues to recover. I am also proud of what our team has continued to accomplish on ESG and sustainability. Last month, we announced that Waters has become the first liquid chromatography column provider to receive the ACT Ecolabel certification from My Green Lab. This designation applies to more than 40 of our LC columns and makes it easier for scientists and procurement professionals to choose more sustainable lab products. So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Caspar. First, thank you for the question. I think you sort of answered your own question. We just sort of taking first just a step back and a 10,000-foot view. I mean our approach to guidance, Vijay has not changed as we progressed through quarter-on-quarter, right? So we look at 3 different things. We, of course, look at the facts from the funnel, how the quarter is progressing, how it's ending, then we spend a lot of time looking at history. I mean, there's not that many businesses that have 20 years of data on instruments quarter-on-quarter. So we look at that and the third thing we do is we talk to our customers and see what the sentiment is, how the orders are progressing, how the sales are progressing. So just to take you through that, and sorry for the long answer, but it will give you context on our philosophy and the guide. So on the fact, you're totally right. We saw -- we've seen progressive improvement from Q1 to Q2. Sales have declined less in Q2 versus Q1 and as Q2 progressed, I mean, as you will know, June is a big month for us. We saw significant momentum in June. You'll remember, in March, we talked about orders and quality of orders and we said we'll start to see them convert into sales towards the end of Q2. Exactly, that's exactly what happened. Lot of sales momentum at the end of the quarter in June and equally, orders growing even faster than sales. So we feel very good about where we see the funnels and what we see with the facts. Now historically, when you look at Waters' business, we have the benefit of, as I said, 20 years of data, especially LC, if you just look at the LC business, when it goes through trough, it is usually between 4 to 7 quarters of negative growth and Q2 was the seventh quarter of negative growth. So we are poised for a recovery and we're operating at -- if you just look at Q2 on a 5-year CAGR basis, it's minus 2%. And we're seeing signs of recovery in LC. So we've factored that into our thinking. And then finally, talking to customers, both of those factual pieces of evidence are verified. I spent a lot of time in the quarter in Europe and in the U.S. with large pharma customers, in particular, China is improving. So as we look at the second half of the year, we're expecting to see improvement quarter-on-quarter as we go from 1 quarter to the other. The second half will see growth, as you rightly pointed out, we've just taken our guidance down, especially in the fourth quarter to assume a slightly lower ramp than we would see historically. So just a little bit of caution built into it. I think on a constant currency basis, it's not more than $50 million. So there's a bit of caution built into what we're seeing. And as more data emerges, you'll see us correct that. Sorry for the long answer, but I know -- I'm sure many people have the same question. Yes. So let me start and Amol can jump in, Dan. So instruments declined about 17% in the quarter, LC was a bit modest than that, mid-teens. -- spec declined a bit more, and TA was around minus 2%, so minus 17% in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing steady improvement as we went through the quarter and the funnels look extremely strong, especially on the LC front. So for the back half of the year, we're assuming that the instrument growth rate would be flat versus the previous year. So overall, second half is flat. And just to sort of go a bit beyond the numbers, and now as I mentioned earlier, the LC replacement cycle now is in the seventh quarter of its decline, we're starting to see across the globe customers initiating their replacement cycle. So we expect that to -- we expect a little bit of decline or flat growth in Q3 for LC, but in Q4, we expect the replacement cycle start to kick in, which is consistent with what we see with the funnels. So quite an exciting time just given the renewed portfolio across all the instruments as a replacement cycle begins, we feel very good about where we are sitting today. Sure. Firstly, I mean, China came in ahead of expectations, right? I mean that's part of the driver for the beat. I mean just to give you a bit of the facts, I mean, Q1, China declined 26%, in Q2, it was around 10% decline. And I mean, in the largest end market pharma, we went again from about a 25%, 26% decline to what a 10% decline in Q2. So steady improvement in China in the second half of the year has a lower base, but we've kept the full year guide at a low double-digit decline for China, just to sort of watch and see more data. So good things happening in China. And again, when you compare LC growth rate, and this is sort of an interesting fact, -- for the first time in a very long time, China's LC decline was less than the rest of the world, right? So China declined in the high single digits, whereas the overall decline for LC was a bit higher than that. Now as you think of the stimulus, nothing has really changed versus previous commentary. We're spending a lot of time with customers, doing 3 things. One, helping them identify the age of instruments. You recall this particular stimulus is targeted towards instrument replacements, the age of their instruments, their visibility for the stimulus and helping them do the paperwork as they start to submit applications for funding. We think this is going to be -- this is going to impact growth only in 2025, maybe a modest impact towards the end of the year, but would not factor that in. I think no change in assumption on the academic side. It's such a small portion of our business, Tycho. So really no change from the previous assumptions. Matt, thank you for the question. I think we were -- we gave a lot of details around this time and probably even earlier than that last year on CDMOs in China, in particular. Really no change from what we saw last quarter, steady improvement on the recurring side as activity starts to pick up a bit from a very low base, right? You'll recall, it's an extremely low base now. but CapEx is still subdued and we have not assumed any improvement in CapEx in the CDMO segment. Now overall, the generics market in pharma in China is starting to get a bit better. I mean this is why we exceeded our growth -- in our growth expectations in Q1 and now in Q2. So steady improvement in China as you go through the year, especially on the LC side, we're starting to see some replacement cycles get initiated there. So CDMO less, but generics a bit more starting to see life there. Amol has given a comprehensive answer. Just 2 points to summarize the whole thing. One, the teams have great muscle now to expand margins during a down cycle, number one. And number two, the pricing that we see is very resilient, and I'm excited about -- excited about the prospects as we come out of this down cycle given the product portfolio that we have. I mean, it's been totally renewed. We have leading products across the board that customers have had a chance to test during the down cycle. So very excited about what we're about to see. Thank you, Rachel. Look, I mean, China, overall, as I said earlier, declined less than what we had thought it for this quarter. So it went from 26% decline in Q1 to about 10% in Q2. Across the different end markets, there was improvement across the board, Pharma went from about 26% decline in Q1 to 10% decline. Same thing with Industrial, which was a 20-ish% decline, again, 11% decline in Q2, and Academic and Government, which had -- which still has very high comps went from over 40% decline to slightly less than 30% decline. I mean, the most interesting thing here is that the replacement cycle is starting to show life in China already. We went from over a 40% decline in Q1 in LC, over 40% to now less than 10%, which was better than the rest of the world, right? So we're starting to see customer activity pick up in China. It's still negative growth versus previous years, but it's starting to get better quarter-on-quarter. And on your question on the stimulus, look, I mean, we are having a ton of conversations with our customers as the activity level remains consistent, right? So the activity level has remained consistent. It's actually improving quarter-on-quarter. From a stimulus perspective, as I said earlier, it's a broader stimulus, it's over a longer period of time, and it specifically targets instrument replacement. So we've been spending a lot of time with our customers, identifying the age of their instruments, defining eligibility versus what the government has targeted, and helping them do the paperwork to submit proposals for funding that becomes available. We don't expect that to impact revenue this year. But surely, it will impact what we see in 2025. So overall, improving conditions across all end markets, especially in Pharma, especially in LC, no real sign of what you're calling an air pocket. Activity is continuing at a baseline level, getting better and customers are getting prepared to get funding from the stimulus. I just want to embellish a little bit on what we're seeing at the end of Q2 that starts to give us confidence, right? June is 1 of the largest months of the year for us. And it has surpassed our expectations, right, both in sales and in orders. So there's a lot of momentum that we've built going into Q3. So that gives us confidence in its a lot in the areas that we've just discussed, right? So it's consistent with an improving trend in the industry. Second, as I said, I spent a fair amount of time with customers, both in Europe and the U.S. in this last quarter, especially in large pharma, customers are now used to the additional steps in the procurement process. In fact, one of the largest pharma companies had introduced several steps in the process, which their internal teams were also learning and we were also learning about, and that sort of -- that gave a little bit of pause to how fast the orders were converting to sales. This time around, when we said in March, order quality is high, like clockwork, we've seen them convert into sales towards the end of June. So now the funnel predictability is way better than we've seen, especially in large pharma and the funnel -- the order quality and the funnel strength is pretty good as we sit looking into the back half of the year. I think it's a great question, Dan, right? And I would look at it 2 ways. One, the HPLC-to-HPLC conversion, right? And that's a robust trend and we have a line of sight on what the fleet is. And there, we offer our customers 2 options, go to the ARC HPLC, which is done really, really well, even during the downturn. And then the Alliance iS, which is now also available for biologics with our premier technology, right? And that has been received extremely well. In a way, the slowdown in the market allowed many of our customers to sample the benefits of Alliance iS, which reduces errors in the QC environment by 40%, which is a significant advance probably the most important advance in the last decade in the HPLC segment itself. So we feel very good on the like-for-like replacement already. Second, when you think of HPLC to UPLC transitions, we are seeing that as well and GLP-1s are a case in point where we see that transition happening. And now on that, let me make 2 comments. One, you've seen that our Biologics revenue as a fraction of overall pharma has gone from roughly 20% to over 35% in the last 3 to 4 years, right? So that has been a very deliberate effort, not just on the UPLC side, HPLC to UPLC side but also in introducing what we call the premier technology, which is tailor-made for large molecules. That is now also available on the UPLC segment, which allows customers to transition the larger part of the pipeline, which is Biologics from HPLC to UPLC very comfortably where now the experimental time is reduced dramatically with the premier technology. So we're seeing both and we are well prepared if the customer decides to remain with HPLC. And equally, we are seeing the trend continue as more and more large molecules and novel modalities come through the pipeline from people transitioning to HPLC to UPLC but there, again, on the receiving end, our UPLCs now have the premier technology, which basically reduce experimental time dramatically. I hope that gives you color into the transition. Great question. And as you know, and I think we've been through this before, we won't comment on July trends but you can assume that June was very robust. Customer activity has been very, very good and that gives us confidence on what we're seeing in -- what we've guided for in Q3. So June has a lot to do with the confidence that we built in the replacement cycle, the confidence that we've built in Q3, the confidence we've also built in the ramp towards -- ramp in Q4. Sure. So 3 questions, right? First, on China. I think we used -- in an interesting way we used the downturn to improve our manufacturing footprint in China, and that is going to help us as the stimulus comes through. We also increased our commercial presence across China. So we feel very good about what the future holds for China, both in terms of local manufacturing, where bulk of our instrument portfolio now is either finished or manufactured in China, and on the commercial side, equally good. Now on your question on India, India has been a star performer for us for many, many quarters. This quarter was no different. We grew in excess of 20% largely on the back of pharma. And there in pharma, LC grew close to 50%, right? And you heard that right, close to 50%. And so that India goes from strength to strength and the Indian government is giving stimulus to like many other countries to their academic and government segments. And there, too, we're benefiting a lot. That segment grew quite rapidly where the funding is captured. And then on Japan, it was a 1% constant currency growth. Yes. And then just coming back to India. Very excited about the prospects there. As with China, during a downturn, we've sort of figured out where to increase our commercial presence in India, we go from strength to strength. The commercial presence has been increased across the board. We've decreased our collaborations on the ground. And India has gone in the last 2 to 3 years from less than 6% of our sales to close to 8% of our sales. right? So it's becoming a more significant part of our business, and it's growing really, really well. Yes. Catherine, thank you for the question. Look, we're very happy with the way the integration has progressed. The synergies are being delivered well ahead of target. That's why you saw growth higher than what we had guided for wyatt itself. And it's, as you know, focused on large molecule applications, which are growing faster than the small molecule applications, be it RNA therapy, be it mAbs, be it viral vectors. We're working closely with customers on increasing applications. What's most exciting is that now the teams are working to take multi-angle light scattering that is the wire technology into QA/QC with basically our Empower software, right and this is really exciting. Now you can imagine that large molecules don't have many different analytical techniques that are in QA/QC. It already has liquid chomatography, to some extent capillary electrophoresis, and now multi-angle light -- all of these now if they are on -- and now the QDA gives us mass analysis. If all of these now, if they talk to Empower allow our customers to submit data to regulators, some very exciting, really good progress on that front, even in a down market, we're seeing good demand for multi-angle light scattering. It's a great setup for exceeding expectations as we go through the year and it's just the guidance philosophy we talked about at the beginning of the call that Vijay started with, and it's a great place to sort of end the call. I mean it's basically what we've done all along. We look at a lot of data from customers, from funnels. Second, we spend a lot of time looking at history of LC replacement, in particular, which bodes well. And third, talk to a lot of customers on how they're receiving our new products, how their spending and growing and all three point towards a more positive second half of the year than we've seen. So that's all been factored in Catherine. Thank you for that question. Caspar?"

            "content": "Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We will provide guidance regarding possible future results as well as commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the third quarter of 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see the risk factors included within our Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide presentation accompanying today's call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call are on a comparable organic constant currency basis. Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled earnings release or as otherwise required by law. Now I'll hand over to Udit to deliver our key remarks. Following that, Amol will present a more detailed view of our results and guidance after we'll open up the phone lines for questions. Over to you, Udit. Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, sales exceeded our guidance range on a reported basis, declining 4%. Organic constant currency sales also declined 4%, which was a 5% improvement in growth compared with Q1 levels. We saw a steady improvement in customer spending throughout the quarter with orders outpacing sales. M&A contributed 2% to sales covering -- results in the first 1.5 months of the quarter. This was better than expected as we were able to accelerate revenue synergies as part of our integration. We are pleased that within the first year of the acquisition -- it is already EPS and margin accretive and our M&A execution remains well on track. Overall, FX was a 2% headwind to the second quarter sales. In organic constant currency terms, by end market, Pharma declined 4%, Industrial declined 4%, and Academic and Government declined 16%. In Pharma, sales excluding China declined low single digits, while in China, sales declined low double digits. In both cases, this reflects an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. In Industrial, sales declined 1% outside of China, led by low single-digit growth in the Americas. We again saw strong growth globally for PFAS-related applications, which has been a consistent tailwind for environmental testing. In China, sales declined low double digits, which was also an improvement in growth rates compared to the previous quarter. For our TA division, sales were flat, driven by improvement in segments such as electronics, advanced materials, and chemicals. In Academic and Government, growth remained weak as stimulus in China and elevated global funding drove lumpy spending patterns and a tough 21% comparison in the prior year's quarter. By geography, sales in Asia declined 3%, while sales in Americas and Europe both declined 7%. By products and services, instruments declined 17% and chemistry and service both grew 5%. There was no change in the number of days versus the prior year quarter. Our commercial initiatives continue to support robust recurring revenue growth despite ongoing headwinds from China. Within our service business, we have already achieved our goal of increasing service plan attachment by a further 100 basis points this year with service planned revenue growing high single digits in the quarter. We are now targeting an additional 50 to 100 basis points of service plan attachment over the remainder of the year. Now I will comment on our second quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volume, FX and inflation. Our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and prudent spend management allowed us to deliver a resilient margin performance in the quarter. Gross margin was flat at 59.3% and our second quarter adjusted operating margin was 29.2% as expected. Excluding FX, both gross margin and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 16.5%, and our average share count was 59.5 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share was $2.63. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share was $2.40. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached in this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the second quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $143 million after funding $36 million of capital expenditures. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow is $377 million or 28% of sales resulting in free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion ratio of 131%. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and a well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will enhance value creation for our shareholders. In the second quarter, we continued to delever while paying out this year's tax reform payment of $96 million and other items totaling $30 million. As expected, at the end of the quarter, our net debt position was approximately $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.7 times. As we continue to delever our balance sheet, we will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout the remainder of the year. Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our guidance for the third quarter. While business conditions showed signs of recovery in the second quarter, we are adding caution to our guidance. As a result, we are revising our full year 2024 sales guidance to assume a more gradual pace of improvement in the second half of the year. Our updated guidance assumes relatively flat quarter-over-quarter revenue progression in Q3 versus Q2. It also implies a weaker than typical budget flush dynamics in the fourth quarter. Despite the added caution, we are still expecting the business to return to growth in the second half of the year. Given these dynamics, our revised full-year 2024 guidance is for organic constant currency sales growth between negative 2% and negative 0.5%. At current exchange rates, we anticipate that currency translation will negatively impact full-year sales by approximately 1.5%. Meanwhile, M&A contribution from wire transaction has added 1.3% to our full year from inorganic sales incurred in the first four and a half months of the year. Therefore, our total full-year 2024 reported sales growth guidance is in the range of negative 2.2% to negative 0.7%. With our commitment to excellent operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L, even with the reduction in our guide. Consistent with our previous guidance, gross margin for the full year is expected to be approximately 59.8%, which is 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. Our adjusted operating margin is expected to be around 31%. Below the line, we expect full-year net interest expense to be approximately $77 million. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be 16.3% and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.4 million. Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full-year revised 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is projected in the range of $11.55 to $11.65 and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 3% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate that customer spending will remain cautious, but show further signs of recovery. We expect an improvement in year-over-year growth compared to that in the second quarter as previous year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier and has continued improvement in funnel activity translates to orders. Given these dynamics, our third-quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of positive 1% to positive 3%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 1.5%. Therefore, our third quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 0.5% to positive 1.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately two percentage points at current FX rates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for our closing comments. Udit? Yes. Look, I mean, as you've seen us through last year and this year also back in '22 against inflationary pressures. Our team is super resilient, and we are able to defend margin and even during down volume cycles, we're able to expand margin. As we've discussed before, we have a set of productivity initiatives that have a very long runway, and we are able to accelerate some of them and that reflects in sort of how we've been able to expand margin even last year. If you look at the embedded implied margin profile in our guide. Our second half margin is relatively flat versus last year. So there is not any meaningful step-up in the second half versus prior year. The only thing is as we've sort of taken a more cautionary view on the guide, we will see some of the actions that we've put in place already show up in Q4, and that will help us a little bit in Q4. But other than that second half is relatively flat versus last year. Yes. So I mean, look, Q-on-Q, Q2 to Q3 is relatively flat. If you look at last 10 years, it has sort of oscillated between plus and minus 3%, right? So it's sort of within the range. And what gives us comfort and confidence on that is what we have in our funnel and the activity that is progressing as well as the fact that we built some backlog in Q2. So that also helps. Going to your other question around second half margins. As I said, second half margins are relatively flat versus last year. There's a small difference between Q3 and Q4, one is the prudence in Q3, the second piece is, as we've sort of taken a more cautionary view on the guide, we've put in place certain cost measures that are already playing out particularly around outside services spend, particularly around how we resource certain growth initiatives and you will start to see some of that impact flow through more in Q4 than in Q3. So there is some plus/minus between Q3, Q4, but overall, second half operating margins are relatively flat versus last year. Yes. And I mean you look at it this way, right, like first half of last year, was super well funded between the China stimulus and what was happening in U.S. and Europe. If you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, pretty much every quarter you will see is like 0.1% growth. . Thanks, Matt, for the question. Look, I mean, there are sort of 3 to 4 broad levers here. One is, our business is structured such that if we grow more than 5%, it produces 50 basis points of volume leverage and that volume leverage largely shows up on the SG&A line versus on the gross margin line. Two, we have benefit from mix as we move to more recurring as well as with the discipline that we've put in pricing, we feel comfortable like we've seen even in these challenging market situations that we are able to do a little more than 100 basis points better than what we've historically done on pricing. And so mix and pricing sort of is accretive to our margin profile. And then a couple of years ago, we started various productivity and operational excellence initiatives that have started bearing fruit, right? Things like procurement excellence, operational excellence in manufacturing, setting up GCC in India, and these initiatives have a long runway, I mean, between these initiatives, we expect to cover approximately 300 basis points over a course of about 8 years, right? So they add up to the profile. So overall, our goal is between the 3 vectors to put about 100 basis points of margin expansion on the board and use about 70 to 80 basis points from these gains to fund higher growth adjacencies and then as we get into sixth, seventh, eighth year, when some of these productivity initiatives will start to saturate, we expect these higher growth adjacencies to start to produce one revenue growth and two, margin accretion, and that will then sort of take over the impact of that productivity initiatives have saturated. Now as we've gone through last couple of years where the volume leverage was not there, in fact, was a headwind, our teams were able to accelerate some of the benefits on these productivity initiatives as well as we took proactive cost actions and got benefit from pricing, which have allowed us to not just defend margin, but also expand margin during down volume cycles and that's where the difference lies, right because people look at it and say, last 10 years, Waters margin has been always sticky at 30% and so where was the volume leverage. And the answer to that is there was always a volume leverage, but we gave it up in a down cycle. And this time around, we like -- we're not giving it up in a down cycle so that we come out much more stronger when the up cycle comes across. Yes. Look, I mean, if we sort of extrapolate our guide and say, where will Q4 and our '24 exit rates will be a good -- even for ex China for LC and MS will be a good couple of hundred basis points below the historic average. And this is ex-China, right? So that gives us a lot of hope and comfort that we are at the bottom of this whole slowdown in the replacement cycle and the fleet out there has aged meaningfully beyond its life needing replacement, particularly for LC. And then China is a twofold equation of when the fleet is aged far more than that but then the question is, when does these generic companies feel comfortable with their status and when do they start replacing and we're seeing signs of that, right? We've had a few generic companies in China already starting to replace their fleet, and we think others will follow over the course of next few quarters. And just to add to that, right, I mean, if you look at our historical instrument growth pattern, the 5% instrument growth has roughly about 50 to 70 basis points of price and 3% of volume, the remaining 1.5 or so really comes from upsell, right? And when we quote our price numbers, their like-for-like SKU and like-for-like geography. So that doesn't include when a customer chooses say, ARC HPLC or Alliance or Alliance iS or ARC UPLC. And in order to achieve that 1.5%, we only need about 7% of these customers to choose an upgrade given the current innovation and the pricing that is out there. And 7%, we feel super comfortable with huge unmet needs that some of our newer launches are directly addressing, which customers are appreciating. . Yes. I mean, look, Japan unit likely are looking at the reported number, right? And you know where Japanese yen has been over the last year, that's like close to 11% headwind so at constant currency we're more or less flat, and that's also sort of the reason why the currency impact for us is somewhat higher and we had to increase it to 1.5% driven by Japan because we have a reasonable Japan footprint. And our team is doing relatively well coming out of the March year-end. So what you see progressing in Q2 and onwards we see healthy demand, and we see good funnel activity in Japan. . Yes. Great question, Jack, as always. Look, I mean, there is going to be some negative mix impact from more instruments when instruments start to come back. But as you look at our guide, that's sort of factored in the gross margin, 20 basis points of expansion that we've outlined for the year. And as we go into next year, if the mix sort of returns back to, call it, say, 2019 levels there will be 10-ish basis points adverse impact, but that's largely covered with the productivity initiatives we have in place so the marginal have got to 20 to 30 basis points still remains intact. Yes. So on the first one, right, I mean we continue to pay down debt from the Wyatt acquisition. We are at 1.7 now. So we are at a point where we are actively considering the switch between paying down debt versus buying back shares. I mean, the intention is to gain strategic flexibility as much as possible. So we continue to review options. And on the number of days, I mean, the key thing to note is on Q4 this year, we have 3 more days than Q3 of this year and that partly helps about 1.5% in the ramp from Q3 to Q4. And then other than that, I mean, there are 2 more days in Q4 of this year versus Q4 of last year. Q3 is roughly the same. No. Look, I mean, most of our guidance caution that we've put in place is around our ex-China business. we just caution for a slower-than-anticipated pace of recovery. China, if anything, if you look at last 2 quarters, we've exceeded our expectations. We haven't just been bold enough to sort of then improve the guidance for the rest of the year, but we remain cautiously optimistic that our team will continue to positively surprise us like they have done in the first 2 quarters."

If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Caspar Tudor, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nCaspar Tudor: Thank you, Ivy. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Waters Corporation First Quarter Earnings Call. Today, I'm joined by Dr. Udit Batra, Waters' President and Chief Executive Officer; and Amol Chaubal, Waters' Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I will cover the cautionary language. I would like to first point out that our earnings release and the slide presentation supplementing today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In this conference call, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. \n In particular, we will provide guidance regarding possible future results and commentary on potential market and business conditions that may impact Waters Corporation over the second quarter of 2024 and full year 2024. These statements are only our present expectations and actual events or results may differ materially. For more details, please see the risk factors included in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our Form 10-Qs and the cautionary language included in this morning's earnings release. During today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including in our discussions of the results of operations. \n Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are attached to our earnings release issued this morning and in the appendix of our presentation, which are available on the company's website. Unless stated otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in organic constant currency terms. In addition, unless stated otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates and ranges given on today's call, are given on a comparable organic constant currency basis. \n Finally, we do not intend to update our guidance, predictions or projections, except as part of a regularly scheduled quarterly earnings release or as otherwise required by law. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Udit to deliver our key remarks, then Amol will provide a more detailed look at our financial results. After, we will open the phone lines to take questions. Udit? \nUdit Batra: Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. \n In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds. This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas.  \n Turning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half.  \n While instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus. Wyatt delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as ZetaStar. \n Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down. While facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%. This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales.  \n With our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Wyatt acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook. Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio.  \n In addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance iS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% of common lab errors. We believe that the Alliance iS is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade.  \n We're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GTxResolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles, nucleic acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service.  \n To simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched waters, Oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and tissues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries.  \n Our Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect PFAS levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone. Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where REACH proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported.  \n In our TA business, we launched the Rheo-IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our hybrid rheometers. This Rheo-Impedance Spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient battery production. \n I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency.  \n We expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. \n Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol? \nAmol Chaubal: Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%.  \n In Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines. In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in PFAS related workflows globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme.  \n However, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected.  \n Within recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. \n Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. \n Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x.  \n This reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. \n Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders. Our full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect Wyatt transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%.  \n Despite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.  \n Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist. In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year.  \n As a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wyatt is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. \n Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? \nUdit Batra: Thank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace.  \n I would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements. From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook.  \n Separately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future.  \n Now to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. \n So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. \nCaspar Tudor: Thanks, Udit. That concludes our formal comments. We are now ready to open the phone lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. \nDaniel Brennan: Maybe the first 1 just on China. You guys were coming into the quarter expecting down 40 and I know it was certainly better than that, and you're talking about Q2 color. I'm just wondering, I know you guys gave some color on what was going on in the quarter. But could you just unpack it a little bit more like what deviated from the guide? How it's pacing in the quarter? And then is there any change to your full year down mid-teens, high-teens growth for China? \nUdit Batra: Look, China came in better than we expected. But I'll remind you, it's still declining in the high 20s. Now we expect that to continue for at least the first half of the year. Q2 will also see a decline and the second half of the year, we'll start to see a little bit of growth given the weakening comps as the year progresses. Now coming back to Q1, to your question on what changed? I mean you just have to go back to late 2023 when we basically said, look, we think across all end markets, especially pharma, we've seen a bottoming out of the volume.  \n And from that baseline, we started to see better activity especially on the replacement of LCs in our Branded Generics segment and something that we had talked about in the last quarter as well. Now it's early days, right? We're starting to see a turn as customers start to replace this sort of highly aging LC fleet. So remember, we again talked about it at the end of last year. When you look at the 5-year stack growth of LC instruments for China, in particular, it's down now almost double digits, about 8% to 9% versus a year versus 5 years.  \n So with that as a baseline, we expect to see the replacement cycle initiate and we've started to see that already in Q1. Now to put things in perspective, there's also a fair amount of talk on the new stimulus and the stimulus itself is very different than the previous one. It appears it's going to roll over a 3-year period. It's 3x in size, and it explicitly calls out instrument replacement, so which encourages us, but we have not incorporated that into the guide for the full year, which now we're basically saying is likely to be low double-digit decline as opposed to the high teens decline that we had talked about when we gave the full year guidance.  \n So China will likely be a little bit better than we had anticipated. And just coming back to the stimulus and looking ahead, I would not -- while we have not incorporated that into our guidance explicitly, I would not underestimate the importance of that on the psychology of CapEx spending, especially the replacement cycle. And as that sort of starts rolling out towards the latter half of the year and towards late 2024 and early 2025, we should see the sentiment improve and likely start of the replacement cycle in earnest. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Udit, maybe on that comment around China. I think you mentioned improved funnel activity in the quarter as the quarter progressed. Is that funnel activity -- is that being sort of driven by this China? Or is that a global biopharma? Any color on what you mean by the funnel activity, and I think for the back half guidance, which assumes I think, close to high singles growth. What visibility do we have in growth normalizing in the back half? \nUdit Batra: Vijay, thank you for the 2 questions. So let me just sort of take a step back and provide some context, right? I mean, as you know, Q1 is the toughest quarter for Waters to predict, right? It's our smallest quarter of the year, and this is when customers start to think through the total CapEx spend for the year and also think through the phasing of that CapEx right? So we took advantage of that. And I personally met several customers across Europe and in the United States, across pharma, across A&G, across our industrial segments, across our clinical segments with our teams.  \n And really, there are 3 main takeaways. First, the quality of the funnel, the quality of the orders is way higher than what we saw a year ago across all of the segments, especially in pharma -- both in pharma and in biotech across Europe and the U.S. Second, when you look at the traction of our new products, our new products are gaining a ton of traction and are being used heavily by our customers. And they're waiting to sort of adopt Alliance iS in earnest, you can go across the portfolio. It's being received extremely well. And third, the question on phasing, while the orders are firm and strong, the CapEx spending is firm, given that it is decided in the late -- in the latter part of Q1, we think it's safe to assume that you'll only start to see the benefit late in Q2 and more so in the second half of the year.  \n So the funnel is weighted towards later in Q2 and the second half of the year. So that's what sort of has gone into our overall thinking. Now there are 2 big takeaways. One, we have increased confidence in our full year guide as a consequence of these discussions. And second, on the phasing, we simply went back and said, okay, let's just look at the last 15 years. Over the last 15 years, the Q2 usually is a step-up from Q1 of about 11% to 12%, right? And so we assumed a 10% step-up from Q1 to Q2.  \n And then first half versus second half, I mean, historically, it's basically, again, over the last 15 years, almost like clockwork. First half is 45% and the second half is 55% of revenues. So that's basically what the algorithm we used to look at the phasing of the guide from a revenue perspective. But overall, really increased confidence in the full year guide given the strengthening of the funnel and conversations across the globe and across customer segments and second, the phasing is basically rooted in history. \nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. I'll let others jump in. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. \nMichael Ryskin: Just following up on some of the end market commentary you talked about China a little about how you expect a low double-digit decline, so a little bit better than prior. You're maintaining the fiscal year. So what's sort of offsetting that? And maybe specifically honing on Americas, it looked like that came a little bit worse in the quarter. Anything changed in your outlook there for the year? And then I've got a quick follow-up. \nAmol Chaubal: Yes. No. I mean, Mike, at this point, we are just derisking the remainder of the guide, right? We had better expectations of China, based on how we are executing in that market, and we're keeping our full year guide flat. \nUdit Batra: Yes. And then I think you asked about the U.S., in particular, what are we seeing in the U.S. Look, I mean, as I said, I spent a fair amount of time with customers across the globe. And one of those was a large customer in the Midwest, where I spent a whole day with about 12 to 13 folks from the customer across many different departments, across development, manufacturing, QA/QC. And we talked deeply about what they envision for CapEx, which I sort of earlier commented on, and the CapEx is very robust.  \n Second, we talked about the use of our new products, think about in-line testing with LCs, think about our columns, think about the upgrades for empower. The software, really, really well received. And we talked about the phasing of the spend, which also, again, is still sort of late Q2 and back half weighted. But to put it all in perspective, if you look at the U.S. itself, the 5 years stack, Michael, is still pretty healthy. It's in the mid- to high single digits, right?  \n So there is really no drama outside of China. I mean we've had 2 exceptional years in ex-China sales. And now you have a little bit of a lull, but the activity looks extremely good, gives us confidence of what we are planning for the full year. So as I said, no drama, no new news, but just other than the fact that new products are gaining traction and customers have much more robust orders than they did a year ago. \nMichael Ryskin: Okay. If I could squeeze in a quick follow-up. On Wyatt, you had some commentary on how the quarter progressed? And if you could elaborate on that a little bit. And it looks like you tweaked down the M&A contribution for the year. I think it was $1.3 million prior. Now it's $1.1 billion. Is that instrument mix in Wyatt? Is that phased and phasing through the year? Just sort of how is that acquisition trending? \nAmol Chaubal: Yes, look, I mean, on Wyatt, we're making fantastic progress, right? All the synergies that we laid out at the beginning of the acquisition, like cross-selling, like attaching our LC seamlessly to the instrument, like attaching our columns with their shipments have all progressed ahead of schedule, including sort of a beta version of bringing light scattering on Empower.  \n Now keep in mind, right, Q1 is a really small quarter and for instruments, especially and when things sort of slip a couple of weeks here and there, it causes that distortion. And that's why we sort of tweaked down Wyatt to 1.1% versus 1.3% M&A contribution. But way that acquisition is going, we are super happy where we are in that journey and really look forward to bringing light scattering into QA/QC. \nUdit Batra: And Michael, to build on it, again, from to customer conversations, I had an opportunity spent some time last week with one of our largest academic customers who has a hospital attached to it. And basically, we talked at length about characterization of lipid nanoparticles, which as you will know, are used for delivery of mRNA, both vaccines and therapeutics as we go forward, an area of intense interest across academia and industry. And these folks specialize in characterizing lipid nanoparticles, which can often be aggregated of different -- and have different sizes and shapes. Lights -- they basically use SEC columns from Waters and light scattering equipment to characterize these aggregates. In addition, what I learned is that they're piloting the use of field flow fractionation, which is another instrument that Wyatt makes as a precursor to using SEC malls, right?  \n And field to fractionation, if -- and the early experiments indicate a really positive outcome. If those experiments work well, could become a mainstay for any experiment that is done to separate these aggregates. And the same idea then applies to AAVs, which is -- which are viral vectors used for cell and gene therapy or other particles, that are used in biologics. So very excited about what we're seeing in Waters, really a great cultural fit, well ahead of all synergy targets and customer conversations even give me more confidence. So in the mid- to long-term, we expect it to continue to be accretive to growth and to margins. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. \nMatthew Sykes: Maybe just revisiting the guide, just given the lower-than-expected guide in Q2, and you mentioned that you expect sort of funnel activity translate into some level of orders towards the end of Q2 into Q3. Have you changed sort of your view on the phasing for second half in terms of the growth you're going to achieve in Q3 versus Q4. Are you pushing more of that potential growth into Q4. Has that phasing at all changed for your full year guide? \nAmol Chaubal: So Matt, thanks for your question. And look, I mean, we executed well to finish at the higher end of our Q1 guide, right? And that sort of keeps us on track for our full year sales guide. And as Udit discussed, our Q2 guide is essentially 10% higher than Q1, which has been sort of our historical trend pre-pandemic. And our second half guide is also very much consistent with how we've historically performed, which is a 45-55 split. So we generally expect the breakdown between Q3 and Q4 to also follow that historical trend for 2024. \nUdit Batra: I think, Matt, thanks for the question. And again, I'll remind you, we had the same discussion when we looked at Q3 versus Q4 of 2023, and there was a lot of discussion on the ramp. And I think we, again, landed at the higher end of what we were predicting. So a difficult business overall to predict if you have high average selling price instruments. But I think we have so much statistics from the history of Waters, gives us a lot of confidence and couple that with discussions that we've had with customers that we think the full year guide is fully intact. And quarter-on-quarter, there's a lot more time to talk about it as we see how Q2 evolves on the ramp between Q3 and Q4. But history should be a decent guide if you're really looking at that sort of modeling between quarters. \nAmol Chaubal: Yes. I mean on a growth basis, it looks a little weird, but that's because of last year, right? The weakness progressively stepped in China and pretty much Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental meaningful bad news out of China, but a lot of that was not reflected in Q1 and Q2. And that's why it sort of it plays out in the growth purely from the baseline effect mostly from China. \nUdit Batra: I think what Amol saying is it's arithmetic and customer conversations give us confidence that we have a pretty good set of visibility. \nMatthew Sykes: Great. And then just one quick follow-up. Just on the academic end market in the quarter. I know you were facing a really challenging comp. I think you grew academic like 45% constant currency. In Q1 of last year. So was there any incremental weakness in that academic end market? Or was it just purely facing difficult comps? \nUdit Batra: Yes, I think you nailed it, it's really difficult comps. I mean it is our smallest segment, in particular, anyway. So you see an exaggerated drop if you just look at year-on-year. And again, if you look at sort of the long-term trend and which is sort of the best way to look at Waters in any case, even in A&G what you find is the 5-year comp is at the low single digit, 5-year CAGR is at the low single-digit range. And ex-China, as I keep saying, there's really no drama ex-China, you're at almost 2% to 3% growth versus what we saw 5 years ago on a CAGR basis. \n And China is down about sort of mid -- low to mid-single digits in the academic segment. Again, given the comps from last year, but also a little bit more exaggerated weakness. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to Rachel Vatnsdal from JPMorgan. \nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: So I wanted to dig into the pharma performance in China a little bit. I believe you said that was down 30% this quarter versus rest of world down low single digits. So can you impact that China performance within Pharma for us a little bit Obviously, we've seen the headlines related to BIOSECURE Act. Last year at 1Q, you guys called out your overexposure to CDMOs in the region. \n So can you quantify for us how much of this was driven by those Tier 1 CDMOs in the region this quarter? And then you previously have kind of broken out those trends between Tier 1 versus Tier 2 and 3 CDMOs. So could you do that for this quarter as well? \nAmol Chaubal: So look, I mean, great question. As you sort of travel through last year, Q2, Q3, Q4, we saw weakness creep in on different elements of the pharma business in China. But as I said earlier in Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental bad news out of China, and that trend sort of has continued into Q1. And so in a way, what played out, what you see in terms of the decline, is largely baseline related where China, from a pharma point of view has bottomed out and there is no incremental headwind coming into the business. \n But we are also not seeing sort of growth in activity, both in CDMOs or in branded generics or in biotechs in China. So if anything, let's call it stable. Now on your second point, which is around the BIOSECURE Act, I mean, look, with the weakness that we observed in 2023, the baseline is largely corrected in China for submarkets like CDMOs, right, including Wuxi. \n We are -- what we are seeing in the market is customers are taking proactive measures to secure their supply chain. And when they are doing that, our service organization, which is really well respected in the industry and plays a pivotal role in these tech transfers are deeply embedded when these moves happen, right? I mean, our role is to support customers in their pursuits and our customers really value our support when they go through situations like this and move products from one site to another. \nUdit Batra: And Rachel, just to embellish on this, and that's a very good sort of insightful question, just to embellish on what Amol said, on the minus 30% for Q1, it came minus 28%, Q1, it came above our expectations, largely because we started to see customers who have aging LC fleets in branded generics start to move, right? So we started to see that signal, which is a positive sign. And as I commented earlier, as the stimulus starts to roll in towards the latter part of the year, that should have a positive impact on the psychology for spending CapEx. \n And I'll remind you that we're sort of almost 50% delinquent on these replacements in the Branded Generics segment, which is the largest segment for LCs in China. So we expect that to turn at some point and the psychology will have a lot to do with it. And on BIOSECURE, I mean it's a net neutral for us at the end, right? I mean we've already bottomed out on CDMOs at -- in China, and I think as customers look for help in transferring from one vendor to another, we stand ready to help them. \nRachel Vatnsdal Olson: Great. And then my follow-up. I want to push on that China stimulus dynamic a little bit more in terms of some of your peers that are working on proposals for customers at this point, so can you talk about the conversations you're having on your end with customers and if you're working on proposals as well. And specifically, what types of instruments and then which industries do you really expect to benefit from within China stimulus? \n We've heard some rumors around this being a little bit more industrial-focused or you seeing down in your proposal funnel as well? And then when do you think that this could eventually translate into orders and revenue? You mentioned back half of the year, some of the psychological impact. So any color on timing expectations that would be helpful as well. \nUdit Batra: Everything and anything about the stimulus, Rachel. Look, the timing, I don't have much more to add than what I said earlier. I think latter half of the year. We are indeed working with several customers on their plans for the stimulus as they hear more across the country. And it is a broad stimulus. I mean this time around, it's a 3-year stimulus, it's 3x in size. It's quite broad across virtually every customer segment, not just limited to A&G. And frankly speaking, I don't know what people -- if they got extra money in academic -- academia, what they would do with it because they've sort of been chockful. \n And I remember I commented sort of in Q3 last year about how many instruments they bought high res instruments and how many are still in boxes. So I don't expect much of it to go to high-tier A&G customers, but definitely beyond that, there is a lot of conversation across many different customer segments as they plan and they learn more about the details of the stimulus. But I would not -- and so we have not incorporated that into the guide, and I would not expect that impact sooner than sort of later this year and in earnest first part of next year. \n So good conversations with customers, planning going on, like you've heard it from others but a broader one, not just limited to academia across industrial, across pharma and the psychological impact I would not underestimate, as I said before, because I think we're operating at a significant deficit on LC instruments and Branded Generics. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Daniel Leonard from UBS. \nDaniel Leonard: One question on your gross margin expansion in the quarter. How much did better-than-expected product mix contribute to that? You mentioned that liquid chromatography did a bit better than planned and mass spec was a bit worse. So I'm curious how much of the contribution that was. \nAmol Chaubal: Dan, yes, I mean, look, the product mix is helping at this point, especially given lower instrument mix, that's contributing about 30 basis points. But keep in mind, there was also a good 70 to 80 basis points of FX headwind that we offsetted, right? So the remaining delta is favorably coming from price and some of the productivity initiatives in manufacturing. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly: I guess in terms of some of these conversations you're having, I'm wondering what stage do you think we're in? It sounds like again, the conversations with the funnel to your point, maybe improving a little bit, specifically with China, it sounds like maybe you're expecting the actual revs to show up late this year at the earliest. So how do you think about just the progression of these conversations into orders, into revs. And again, is there a potential for a bit of an air pocket as these conversations pick up and the dollars materialize a little later in the year? How do you think about just the progression there? \nUdit Batra: It's a great question. Look, Patrick, let's just take a full step back on Waters, right? As you know and many on the call know, we've grown instruments roughly 5%. And I know your question is targeted towards instruments. Instruments have grown on average 5% over the last 15 years, right? And those statistics are sort of easily available given that we've not done a lot of M&A. You can look at our longitudinal history on instruments, right? So about 5% on average, but no year is actually 5% on the dot, right? There are 5 that are well below 5 that are well above and 5 close to the average, right? \n So you start with that. And since I've been at the company in the last 3.5 years, we've seen a microcosm of that already, right? So 2 years of 20-plus percent growth and now a bit of decline in instrument growth rate. We didn't get too excited when things were at 20-plus percent growth for several quarters in a row. And we said this is not going to last just given the long-term averages. And we're not so phased when we look at what we are seeing now. And now let me sort of address your question just with that as context, it's very difficult to predict a quarter-on-quarter rollout of instruments for Waters. \n But I think it's more instructive to look at the 5-year average, especially when you think about LC. And a 5-year CAGR for LC is operating now at the low single-digit level. In China, it's almost double-digit decline. So we are due for a replacement cycle to begin very soon in LC instrumentation. And remember, these are used in QA/QC. So you can't forever defer these replacements. And the conversations that we've had with customers, and as I said, I spent a whole day with one of our largest customers, especially in QA/QC, they are raring to go and start the replacement cycles, right, on LCs. \n The aging fleet is not something that they want to have, especially for new launches, which are going to be high volume and, of course, marketed compounds. So I think things are trending in the right direction. But again, I mean, just put this all in context, there's really, again, one shouldn't get too excited when you see high growth and decline, especially for our instrument portfolio. And when you look at the full year, again, I'll remind you that it's a 45, 55 average for the overall business, right? \n First half, 45%, second half, 55%, and that's what we've assumed for the full year phasing overall, and the step-up in the second quarter is roughly 10%. So just sort of give you broad sort of signpost. But the conversations were with a QA -- with a heavy focus on QA/QC. And we see replacement -- signs of replacement cycles beginning both in China, which we commented on earlier, ex-China. \nPatrick Donnelly: And then Amol, maybe just quickly on the margin side. Can you just talk about the progression as we work our way through the year. I know you guys have some kind of cost initiatives working the way through the year last year. So I'm just trying to think on the cadence there and any moving pieces you want to call out as you work our way through '24 here. \nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Look, I mean, already in Q1, we put good numbers on board and continued our good financial performance. As you get into second half of the year, keep in mind, the proactive cost actions that we took are already in the baseline, and there will be some headwind as we accrue for bonuses. So you may not see meaningful margin expansion in the second half, net of those 2 effects, but we would have mostly covered our ground for the 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion mostly in the first half. So we will still end up delivering an adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points. \nOperator: Next, we'll go to the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. \nDouglas Schenkel: Udit, thank you for the commentary on the quality of the funnel and also providing context, looking back 15 years at seasonal patterns, that's helpful. That said, recognizing those points and even being mindful of the year-over-year comparisons and how they progress over the course of the year. Your guidance, it doesn't seem conservative to me to be direct, at least as I look at the model. I'm struggling a little bit to kind of see how you get there in spite of all the helpful commentary you provided. To explain where I'm coming from, starting on revenue, the 45, 55 H1, H2 revenue split. It's a long-term norm, but it certainly isn't the recent norm. \n And then looking at things a different way, I think you would need to go down -- go from being down more than 6% organic in the first half, to being up more than 7% positive in the second half. And for margins, if I'm doing the math right, I think you're essentially implying a targeted second half operating margin of around 33.5%, which is a bigger first half to second half ramp than normal. So with all of that in mind, my questions are really the following: one, how dependent are you on an instrument recovery and, in fact, a normalization to trend in the fourth quarter to get to these targets? \n Two, if the answer is you are assuming a normalization, how do we put that with the margin guidance? And then third, given investor concern and just the market backdrop, keeping in mind, none of your peers sound good on China or instruments right now, did you contemplate cutting guidance a bit? I know that was a lot, so I'll get back in the queue and listen. \nUdit Batra: Go ahead -- Let's Amol start, and then I'll jump in. \nAmol Chaubal: Yes. Look, I mean, where we stand at this point, one may say, look, your Q2 guidance is conservative given there was some delay in budget releases in Q1. And we've been prudent there just to stay with our historical norm, right? Q3, Q4, we have some visibility in CRM. But the sales cycle, as you know, is 6, 9 months, so you don't have all the visibility, but it's still in line with the historical pattern, and we are seeing increased activity at early stages in our pipeline, which we think will convert into orders as the year progresses, right? \n If you look at ex-China pretty much across these quarters, it is on a 5-year stack basis, a little lower, mid-single digits. So again, as Udit said, there is no noise ex-China. And really what plays out in the growth guide is how progressively the decline in China translates to a modest increase in the second half of the year, and that's what we are modeling. There could be upside on China, if China performs well. And we did some of that in our guide where we saw a little bit better China, and we derisk the remainder of the guide. \n On your second question on the margin, I mean, as I said earlier, right, a lot of the cost work we did last year is in the second half baseline. So you're going to see very modest, if any, margin expansion in the second half, but we would have covered most of the ground on the 20 to 30 basis points of full year margin expansion in the first half. And China, I mean, stimulus is not in our guide. We expect very little towards the end of the year, if any, because a lot of things need to be worked out there. But we are super encouraged by what the government is doing, both in terms of the size and the tenure of the stimulus and the secondary effect it will have on the local mentality and purchase patterns. \nUdit Batra: Yes. And then just to sort of, again, embellish just a little bit, Doug, and summarize. First, yes, I mean, the discussions with customers are increasingly positive, but we felt we want to see that land first before we start assuming that it has come, right? So you can imagine, given how difficult it is to predict instrument businesses year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter is even trickier -- a trickier exercise. So yes, the conversations are positive, but we want to see it land and then we'll have -- hopefully, you're right, and then we can have another discussion at the end of Q2 that looks a little bit different. \n Second, on China, it's a pure math issue, right? I mean the year has started better than we expected, but the second half of the year is when all the weakness was plugged in -- into the overall numbers. So you see second half being slightly -- basically flattish to slight growth. But if you put it all together, I mean, there is no drama ex-China. It's low single-digit growth prediction for the full year across the different customer segments, especially pharma and academia. And in China, it's a low double-digit decline after a very significant decline in the previous year. So really, there's not a lot of risk, as I look at it after the conversations that we've recently had with customers, the visibility we currently have. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. \nCatherine Ramsey: Maybe just on pharma. I think you said down low single digits ex-China. And you talked about budgets opening up throughout the quarter. So can you just talk through the health of that end market outside of China exiting the quarter and your expectations for the second quarter for that end market? \nUdit Batra: So Catherine, thank you for the question. Look, pharma overall even last year grew low single digits for us for the full year. And the full year guide again is low single-digit growth. Q1 was sort of a low single-digit decliner, but the conversations with customers make us even more confident that the full year guide is very much intact for a low single-digit growth in pharma. And as I said before, look, first, the orders look much more firm than they did a year ago across biotech and across pharma. \n Second, when I look at what traction our products have especially the products that are meant to solve problems for large molecules, be it in columns. And I talked about that in the prepared remarks, be it in analysis using light scattering or using mass spec and LC the products have an extremely, extremely good traction. And as far as phasing is concerned, it's the same commentary that I provided overall. Look, Q1 came in as we expected for pharma and as we roll through the year, basically, the comps get a little bit easier. And so you see us landing at the full -- landing the full year with a low single-digit growth for pharma. \nCaspar Tudor: Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support and interest in Waters. A replay of this call will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website. This concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at future events and conferences. \nOperator: Thank you all for joining. That concludes the Waters Corporation First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. You may disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Udit Batra",
            "content": "Thank you, Caspar, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with sales coming in at the high end of our expectations backed again by excellent operational performance. I want to begin today's call by thanking my colleagues for their continued focus on innovation and supporting our customers. These results reflect our drive to accelerate the benefits of pioneering science with our innovative portfolio. \n In the first quarter, market conditions were as expected, with cautious customer spending and later than typical budget releases. But as budgets opened up, we executed well with sales landing at the high end of our guide. We also continued to deliver outstanding operational results. Earnings were above our guidance and margins expanded even with volume and FX headwinds. This is a testament to our team, our resilient business model and our operational initiatives. Waters is well positioned for future growth in our attractive secular end markets. In the first quarter, we added to our revitalized portfolio with new products that serve high-growth areas.  \n Turning now to our results. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded our guidance at $2.21. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.72. Outside of China, sales declined mid-single digits as expected. In China, sales declined just under 30%, which was better than expected. Growth remained weak as our prior year baseline does not reflect last year's deterioration in market conditions, which became more pronounced in the second half.  \n While instruments declined 25% overall, LC sales were slightly better than expected, instrument weakness was led by mass spec, particularly for A&G-related applications, which had a tough prior year comparison from global funding and the China stimulus. Wyatt delivered a 3% M&A contribution to sales. We continue to see strong synergy performance and traction for our recently launched products such as ZetaStar. \n Now I will talk more about our operational performance. We believe the best reflection of good operational execution is effective margin management, particularly when things slow down. While facing significant headwinds from volume, FX and inflation, we delivered yet another strong margin result. Our gross margin expanded 40 basis points to 58.9%, and our operating margin expanded 20 basis points for the quarter to 27%. This was achieved through a combination of our operational management initiatives across pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment. These initiatives position us well for resilience during lower volume periods and give longer-term opportunity when market conditions normalize. You can see further evidence of our operational performance and our free cash flow. We had an exceptional start to the year, generating free cash flow of USD 234 million in the first quarter, which was 37% of sales.  \n With our excellent free cash flow profile, we made rapid progress in delevering from the Wyatt acquisition, as we approach its 1-year anniversary. We serve attractive secular end markets where testing volume plays a pivotal role in our business. This volume, which is correlated with global prescription consumption is expected to accelerate in the future, supporting our strong long-term growth outlook. Our distinct advantage in downstream applications lines with our full ecosystem of products that complement our innovative instrument portfolio.  \n In addition, we have strategically aligned with high-growth opportunities that further enhance our core position. We had a busy quarter launching several new products that support a number of exciting, high-growth areas. At Analytica, last month, we launched the Alliance iS Bio, a version of our groundbreaking next-generation liquid chromatography platform suited for biologics applications. In the -- the new HPLC system combines advanced bioseparation technology, bioinert surfaces and built-in intelligence features. This helps Biopharma QC analysts boost efficiency and eliminate up to 40% of common lab errors. We believe that the Alliance iS is the most significant innovation to hit pharma QA/QC labs in over a decade.  \n We're excited to bring this technology to routine testing applications for biologics. Supporting BioSeparations, we launched a new set of size exclusion chromatography columns called GTxResolve Premier. These columns enable scientists to quickly assess aggregate content, integrity and purity of larger biologic particles. It covers modalities such as lipid nanoparticles, nucleic acids, and viral vectors and give scientists a significant improvement in sensitivity and sample consumption while accelerating run times. This launch supports the development of these modalities into downstream high-volume settings, where Waters has critical instrument technology like LC, mass spec and light scattering as well as highly innovative industry-leading software chemistry and service.  \n To simplify the detection of PFAS, we launched waters, Oasis, dual-phase analysis cartridges. This consumable streamline sample prep for PFAS workflows when detecting concentrations in water, soils, biosolids and tissues. It joins our comprehensive portfolio of solutions that support the surging demand for PFAS testing, which is a USD 300 million to USD 350 million global market, growing 20% annually. In an environment of increased scrutiny, the ability to accurately test for PFAS at very low levels is becoming a critical compliance need for a broad spectrum of industries.  \n Our Xevo TQ absolute mass spec has leading sensitivity for detecting these anionic compounds. It can detect PFAS levels at as low as 1 part per quadrillion. Last month, in the United States, the EPA finalized and enforceable 4 parts per trillion limit of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water, which marks a significant regulatory milestone. Later this year, further regulations governing PFAS are expected across the globe. This includes the European Union, where REACH proposed chemicals, regulation contemplates a PFAS ban on products manufactured as well as once imported.  \n In our TA business, we launched the Rheo-IS, which serves battery testing applications when used with our hybrid rheometers. This Rheo-Impedance Spectroscopy accessory supports characterization of electrode studies, which can lead to more efficient battery production. \n I will now cover our 2024 full year guidance. With our first quarter results, we remain on track to achieve our full year revenue outlook, which is unchanged from our previous guidance at negative 0.5% to positive 1.5% growth in organic constant currency.  \n We expect growth rates to improve over the remainder of the year and as our prior year comparisons, especially in China get easier. We expect improving funnel activity to translate to orders as the year progresses. With our strong operational performance, we expect to build leverage in our P&L despite the flattish revenue guide and delivered 20 to 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion while still reinvesting for growth. As a result, our adjusted EPS guidance is also unchanged at 0% to 3% growth in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. \n Now I will pass the call over to Amol to continue covering our financial results in more detail and provide the rest of our guidance. Amol? Thank you, Amol. I would like now to give you a brief update on our progress towards leaving the world better than we found it, which is how we think about ESG. We work alongside wonderful people here at Waters, and I'm always proud when others recognize their talent and hard work. Our colleagues were recognized in the quarter for their achievements and contributions to separation science, excellence in manufacturing and for being champions of LGBTQ and women's benefits in the workplace.  \n I would also like to congratulate Dr. Philip Wyatt, the founder of Wyatt Technology for receiving the esteemed Pittcon Heritage Award earlier this year. Dr. Wyatt's groundbreaking contributions to laser light scattering technology have paved the way for industry-leading advancements. From a corporate standpoint, Waters has once again been honored by Barron's, earning a place on its list of the 100 most sustainable companies in 2024. Additionally, we are delighted to announce that S&P Global has included Waters in its 2024 sustainability yearbook.  \n Separately, our commitment to robust governance practices was recently highlighted by the New England Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors. We were honored to have Massachusetts Governor, Maura Healey present Waters with the 2024 public company Board of the Year Award. After recently committing to SBTI, which is the science-based targets initiative, we are now building on the excellent progress we made in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. We're in the process of setting new standards towards a long-term reduction in emissions and aligning our business with the 1.5 degree centigrade future.  \n Now to summarize, we're pleased with how the first quarter landed versus our expectations, which supports our full year guidance. We remain on track to achieving the 2024 objectives and look forward to building on this strength as the year progresses. Our long-term growth profile remains excellent, and we are aligned to secular tailwinds that are stronger than ever in our attractive markets. With our robust financial profile and balanced capital allocation strategy, we have an excellent platform to deliver sustained value for our shareholders. \n So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Caspar. Look, China came in better than we expected. But I'll remind you, it's still declining in the high 20s. Now we expect that to continue for at least the first half of the year. Q2 will also see a decline and the second half of the year, we'll start to see a little bit of growth given the weakening comps as the year progresses. Now coming back to Q1, to your question on what changed? I mean you just have to go back to late 2023 when we basically said, look, we think across all end markets, especially pharma, we've seen a bottoming out of the volume.  \n And from that baseline, we started to see better activity especially on the replacement of LCs in our Branded Generics segment and something that we had talked about in the last quarter as well. Now it's early days, right? We're starting to see a turn as customers start to replace this sort of highly aging LC fleet. So remember, we again talked about it at the end of last year. When you look at the 5-year stack growth of LC instruments for China, in particular, it's down now almost double digits, about 8% to 9% versus a year versus 5 years.  \n So with that as a baseline, we expect to see the replacement cycle initiate and we've started to see that already in Q1. Now to put things in perspective, there's also a fair amount of talk on the new stimulus and the stimulus itself is very different than the previous one. It appears it's going to roll over a 3-year period. It's 3x in size, and it explicitly calls out instrument replacement, so which encourages us, but we have not incorporated that into the guide for the full year, which now we're basically saying is likely to be low double-digit decline as opposed to the high teens decline that we had talked about when we gave the full year guidance.  \n So China will likely be a little bit better than we had anticipated. And just coming back to the stimulus and looking ahead, I would not -- while we have not incorporated that into our guidance explicitly, I would not underestimate the importance of that on the psychology of CapEx spending, especially the replacement cycle. And as that sort of starts rolling out towards the latter half of the year and towards late 2024 and early 2025, we should see the sentiment improve and likely start of the replacement cycle in earnest. Vijay, thank you for the 2 questions. So let me just sort of take a step back and provide some context, right? I mean, as you know, Q1 is the toughest quarter for Waters to predict, right? It's our smallest quarter of the year, and this is when customers start to think through the total CapEx spend for the year and also think through the phasing of that CapEx right? So we took advantage of that. And I personally met several customers across Europe and in the United States, across pharma, across A&G, across our industrial segments, across our clinical segments with our teams.  \n And really, there are 3 main takeaways. First, the quality of the funnel, the quality of the orders is way higher than what we saw a year ago across all of the segments, especially in pharma -- both in pharma and in biotech across Europe and the U.S. Second, when you look at the traction of our new products, our new products are gaining a ton of traction and are being used heavily by our customers. And they're waiting to sort of adopt Alliance iS in earnest, you can go across the portfolio. It's being received extremely well. And third, the question on phasing, while the orders are firm and strong, the CapEx spending is firm, given that it is decided in the late -- in the latter part of Q1, we think it's safe to assume that you'll only start to see the benefit late in Q2 and more so in the second half of the year.  \n So the funnel is weighted towards later in Q2 and the second half of the year. So that's what sort of has gone into our overall thinking. Now there are 2 big takeaways. One, we have increased confidence in our full year guide as a consequence of these discussions. And second, on the phasing, we simply went back and said, okay, let's just look at the last 15 years. Over the last 15 years, the Q2 usually is a step-up from Q1 of about 11% to 12%, right? And so we assumed a 10% step-up from Q1 to Q2.  \n And then first half versus second half, I mean, historically, it's basically, again, over the last 15 years, almost like clockwork. First half is 45% and the second half is 55% of revenues. So that's basically what the algorithm we used to look at the phasing of the guide from a revenue perspective. But overall, really increased confidence in the full year guide given the strengthening of the funnel and conversations across the globe and across customer segments and second, the phasing is basically rooted in history. Yes. And then I think you asked about the U.S., in particular, what are we seeing in the U.S. Look, I mean, as I said, I spent a fair amount of time with customers across the globe. And one of those was a large customer in the Midwest, where I spent a whole day with about 12 to 13 folks from the customer across many different departments, across development, manufacturing, QA/QC. And we talked deeply about what they envision for CapEx, which I sort of earlier commented on, and the CapEx is very robust.  \n Second, we talked about the use of our new products, think about in-line testing with LCs, think about our columns, think about the upgrades for empower. The software, really, really well received. And we talked about the phasing of the spend, which also, again, is still sort of late Q2 and back half weighted. But to put it all in perspective, if you look at the U.S. itself, the 5 years stack, Michael, is still pretty healthy. It's in the mid- to high single digits, right?  \n So there is really no drama outside of China. I mean we've had 2 exceptional years in ex-China sales. And now you have a little bit of a lull, but the activity looks extremely good, gives us confidence of what we are planning for the full year. So as I said, no drama, no new news, but just other than the fact that new products are gaining traction and customers have much more robust orders than they did a year ago. And Michael, to build on it, again, from to customer conversations, I had an opportunity spent some time last week with one of our largest academic customers who has a hospital attached to it. And basically, we talked at length about characterization of lipid nanoparticles, which as you will know, are used for delivery of mRNA, both vaccines and therapeutics as we go forward, an area of intense interest across academia and industry. And these folks specialize in characterizing lipid nanoparticles, which can often be aggregated of different -- and have different sizes and shapes. Lights -- they basically use SEC columns from Waters and light scattering equipment to characterize these aggregates. In addition, what I learned is that they're piloting the use of field flow fractionation, which is another instrument that Wyatt makes as a precursor to using SEC malls, right?  \n And field to fractionation, if -- and the early experiments indicate a really positive outcome. If those experiments work well, could become a mainstay for any experiment that is done to separate these aggregates. And the same idea then applies to AAVs, which is -- which are viral vectors used for cell and gene therapy or other particles, that are used in biologics. So very excited about what we're seeing in Waters, really a great cultural fit, well ahead of all synergy targets and customer conversations even give me more confidence. So in the mid- to long-term, we expect it to continue to be accretive to growth and to margins. I think, Matt, thanks for the question. And again, I'll remind you, we had the same discussion when we looked at Q3 versus Q4 of 2023, and there was a lot of discussion on the ramp. And I think we, again, landed at the higher end of what we were predicting. So a difficult business overall to predict if you have high average selling price instruments. But I think we have so much statistics from the history of Waters, gives us a lot of confidence and couple that with discussions that we've had with customers that we think the full year guide is fully intact. And quarter-on-quarter, there's a lot more time to talk about it as we see how Q2 evolves on the ramp between Q3 and Q4. But history should be a decent guide if you're really looking at that sort of modeling between quarters. I think what Amol saying is it's arithmetic and customer conversations give us confidence that we have a pretty good set of visibility. Yes, I think you nailed it, it's really difficult comps. I mean it is our smallest segment, in particular, anyway. So you see an exaggerated drop if you just look at year-on-year. And again, if you look at sort of the long-term trend and which is sort of the best way to look at Waters in any case, even in A&G what you find is the 5-year comp is at the low single digit, 5-year CAGR is at the low single-digit range. And ex-China, as I keep saying, there's really no drama ex-China, you're at almost 2% to 3% growth versus what we saw 5 years ago on a CAGR basis. \n And China is down about sort of mid -- low to mid-single digits in the academic segment. Again, given the comps from last year, but also a little bit more exaggerated weakness. And Rachel, just to embellish on this, and that's a very good sort of insightful question, just to embellish on what Amol said, on the minus 30% for Q1, it came minus 28%, Q1, it came above our expectations, largely because we started to see customers who have aging LC fleets in branded generics start to move, right? So we started to see that signal, which is a positive sign. And as I commented earlier, as the stimulus starts to roll in towards the latter part of the year, that should have a positive impact on the psychology for spending CapEx. \n And I'll remind you that we're sort of almost 50% delinquent on these replacements in the Branded Generics segment, which is the largest segment for LCs in China. So we expect that to turn at some point and the psychology will have a lot to do with it. And on BIOSECURE, I mean it's a net neutral for us at the end, right? I mean we've already bottomed out on CDMOs at -- in China, and I think as customers look for help in transferring from one vendor to another, we stand ready to help them. Everything and anything about the stimulus, Rachel. Look, the timing, I don't have much more to add than what I said earlier. I think latter half of the year. We are indeed working with several customers on their plans for the stimulus as they hear more across the country. And it is a broad stimulus. I mean this time around, it's a 3-year stimulus, it's 3x in size. It's quite broad across virtually every customer segment, not just limited to A&G. And frankly speaking, I don't know what people -- if they got extra money in academic -- academia, what they would do with it because they've sort of been chockful. \n And I remember I commented sort of in Q3 last year about how many instruments they bought high res instruments and how many are still in boxes. So I don't expect much of it to go to high-tier A&G customers, but definitely beyond that, there is a lot of conversation across many different customer segments as they plan and they learn more about the details of the stimulus. But I would not -- and so we have not incorporated that into the guide, and I would not expect that impact sooner than sort of later this year and in earnest first part of next year. \n So good conversations with customers, planning going on, like you've heard it from others but a broader one, not just limited to academia across industrial, across pharma and the psychological impact I would not underestimate, as I said before, because I think we're operating at a significant deficit on LC instruments and Branded Generics. It's a great question. Look, Patrick, let's just take a full step back on Waters, right? As you know and many on the call know, we've grown instruments roughly 5%. And I know your question is targeted towards instruments. Instruments have grown on average 5% over the last 15 years, right? And those statistics are sort of easily available given that we've not done a lot of M&A. You can look at our longitudinal history on instruments, right? So about 5% on average, but no year is actually 5% on the dot, right? There are 5 that are well below 5 that are well above and 5 close to the average, right? \n So you start with that. And since I've been at the company in the last 3.5 years, we've seen a microcosm of that already, right? So 2 years of 20-plus percent growth and now a bit of decline in instrument growth rate. We didn't get too excited when things were at 20-plus percent growth for several quarters in a row. And we said this is not going to last just given the long-term averages. And we're not so phased when we look at what we are seeing now. And now let me sort of address your question just with that as context, it's very difficult to predict a quarter-on-quarter rollout of instruments for Waters. \n But I think it's more instructive to look at the 5-year average, especially when you think about LC. And a 5-year CAGR for LC is operating now at the low single-digit level. In China, it's almost double-digit decline. So we are due for a replacement cycle to begin very soon in LC instrumentation. And remember, these are used in QA/QC. So you can't forever defer these replacements. And the conversations that we've had with customers, and as I said, I spent a whole day with one of our largest customers, especially in QA/QC, they are raring to go and start the replacement cycles, right, on LCs. \n The aging fleet is not something that they want to have, especially for new launches, which are going to be high volume and, of course, marketed compounds. So I think things are trending in the right direction. But again, I mean, just put this all in context, there's really, again, one shouldn't get too excited when you see high growth and decline, especially for our instrument portfolio. And when you look at the full year, again, I'll remind you that it's a 45, 55 average for the overall business, right? \n First half, 45%, second half, 55%, and that's what we've assumed for the full year phasing overall, and the step-up in the second quarter is roughly 10%. So just sort of give you broad sort of signpost. But the conversations were with a QA -- with a heavy focus on QA/QC. And we see replacement -- signs of replacement cycles beginning both in China, which we commented on earlier, ex-China. Go ahead -- Let's Amol start, and then I'll jump in. Yes. And then just to sort of, again, embellish just a little bit, Doug, and summarize. First, yes, I mean, the discussions with customers are increasingly positive, but we felt we want to see that land first before we start assuming that it has come, right? So you can imagine, given how difficult it is to predict instrument businesses year-on-year, quarter-on-quarter is even trickier -- a trickier exercise. So yes, the conversations are positive, but we want to see it land and then we'll have -- hopefully, you're right, and then we can have another discussion at the end of Q2 that looks a little bit different. \n Second, on China, it's a pure math issue, right? I mean the year has started better than we expected, but the second half of the year is when all the weakness was plugged in -- into the overall numbers. So you see second half being slightly -- basically flattish to slight growth. But if you put it all together, I mean, there is no drama ex-China. It's low single-digit growth prediction for the full year across the different customer segments, especially pharma and academia. And in China, it's a low double-digit decline after a very significant decline in the previous year. So really, there's not a lot of risk, as I look at it after the conversations that we've recently had with customers, the visibility we currently have. So Catherine, thank you for the question. Look, pharma overall even last year grew low single digits for us for the full year. And the full year guide again is low single-digit growth. Q1 was sort of a low single-digit decliner, but the conversations with customers make us even more confident that the full year guide is very much intact for a low single-digit growth in pharma. And as I said before, look, first, the orders look much more firm than they did a year ago across biotech and across pharma. \n Second, when I look at what traction our products have especially the products that are meant to solve problems for large molecules, be it in columns. And I talked about that in the prepared remarks, be it in analysis using light scattering or using mass spec and LC the products have an extremely, extremely good traction. And as far as phasing is concerned, it's the same commentary that I provided overall. Look, Q1 came in as we expected for pharma and as we roll through the year, basically, the comps get a little bit easier. And so you see us landing at the full -- landing the full year with a low single-digit growth for pharma."

            "name": "Amol Chaubal",
            "content": "Thank you, Udit, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, sales landed at the high end of our guidance range, declining 7% as reported and 9% in organic constant currency. As Udit mentioned, end market dynamics were consistent with our expectations. Ex-China declined mid-single digits as expected, while China declined close to 30%, which was slightly better than expected. In organic constant currency by end market, Pharma declined 6%, industrial declined 7% and academic and government declined 30%.  \n In Pharma, sales outside of China declined low single digits as we executed well in this CapEx constrained environment. In China, sales declined almost 30% due to ongoing market challenges that are not reflected in our prior year baselines. In industrial, food and environmental applications grew mid-single digits with continued strong growth in PFAS related workflows globally. We also saw strong growth in battery testing within our TA business, which has been a consistent growth theme.  \n However, this strength was more than offset by weakness in core industrial applications, which are more cyclical. Our TA business declined high single digits overall, while chemical analysis declined high teens. In academic and government, growth was weak against a 45% comparison as stimulus in China and elevated global funding in the prior year quarter drove lumpy spending patterns. By geography, sales in Asia declined 16%. The Americas declined 8% and Europe declined 3%. By products and services, instruments declined 25% with LC growth slightly better than expected.  \n Within recurring revenues, chemistry grew low single digits and service grew mid-single digits, both of which were affected by low activity levels in China. The quarter had 1 fewer day versus first quarter of 2023, which translates to a growth headwind of approximately 1% for recurring revenues. \n Now I will comment on our first quarter non-GAAP financial performance versus the prior year. Despite headwinds from lower sales volumes, FX and inflation, our team continued to respond to these challenges with resilience and commitment. Our focus on operational excellence with pricing, productivity and proactive cost alignment allowed us to deliver first quarter gross margin of 58.9%, an expansion of 40 basis points and first quarter adjusted operating margin of 27% and expansion of 20 basis points. Our effective operating tax rate for the quarter was 14.3% and our average share count was 59.4 million shares. Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $2.21. On a GAAP basis, earnings per fully diluted share were $1.72. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is attached to this morning's press release and in the appendix of our earnings call presentation. \n Turning now to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet. We define free cash flow as cash from operations, less capital expenditures and excludes special items. In the first quarter of 2024, free cash flow was $234 million after funding $29 million of capital expenditures, which is approximately 37% of sales. We maintain a strong balance sheet, access to liquidity and well-structured debt maturity profile. This strength allows us to prioritize investing in growth, including M&A and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to evaluate M&A opportunities that will meaningfully accelerate value creation. At the end of the quarter, our net debt position further declined to $1.7 billion, which is a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1.8x.  \n This reflects a decrease of approximately $300 million, as we delivered the Wyatt acquisition. As previously disclosed, our share buyback program has been temporarily suspended to enable us to pay down debt incurred as part of the Wyatt acquisition last year. We will evaluate the resumption of our share repurchase program throughout 2024 as part of our balanced capital deployment objectives. \n Now I would like to share further commentary on our full year outlook and provide you with our second quarter guidance. We expect to see an improvement in sales growth over the course of 2024 as prior year comparisons, particularly in China, become easier, and has improved funnel activity translates to orders. Our full year guidance is unchanged with 2024 organic constant currency sales growth expected between negative 0.5% and positive 1.5%. At current exchange rates, currency translation is expected to result in a negative impact of just under 1% on a full year sales basis. We expect Wyatt transaction to add just over 1% M&A contribution to our full year 2024 revenue for inorganic sales incurred in the first 4.5 months of the year. Therefore, our total reported sales growth guidance is unchanged at approximately 0% to 2%.  \n Despite guiding to flattish sales, we expect to deliver a gross margin of 59.8% for the full year, which is a 20 basis points of expansion versus 2023. We also expect to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion versus 2023, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of slightly over 31%. We expect our full year net interest expense to be approximately $80 million. Our full year tax rate is expected to be 16.3%, and our average diluted 2024 share count is expected to be approximately 59.7 million.  \n Rolling all this together, on a non-GAAP basis, our full year 2024 earnings per fully diluted share guidance is also unchanged and projected in the range of $11.75 to $12.05. This is approximately 0% to 3% growth and includes an estimated headwind of approximately 2% due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Looking to the second quarter 2024, we anticipate that cautious customer spending will persist. In addition, while the China Q2 baseline reflects the onset of weakness, it does not fully reflect the weakness we observed in the second half of the year.  \n As a result, we expect China to decline mid-teens in Q2 versus 28% decline we saw in Q1. Given these dynamics, we expect to see an improvement in year-over-year growth versus the first quarter and our second quarter organic constant currency sales growth guidance is projected in the range of negative 6% to negative 4%. At current rates, currency translation is expected to subtract approximately 2%. Wyatt is expected to add approximately 1.5% M&A contribution for sales incurred in the first 1.5 month of the quarter. Therefore, our total second quarter reported sales growth guidance is negative 6.5% to negative 4.5%. Based on these revenue expectations, second quarter non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60, which includes a negative currency impact of approximately 4 percentage points at current FX rates. \n Now I would like to turn the call back to Udit for some summary comments. Udit? Yes. No. I mean, Mike, at this point, we are just derisking the remainder of the guide, right? We had better expectations of China, based on how we are executing in that market, and we're keeping our full year guide flat. Yes, look, I mean, on Wyatt, we're making fantastic progress, right? All the synergies that we laid out at the beginning of the acquisition, like cross-selling, like attaching our LC seamlessly to the instrument, like attaching our columns with their shipments have all progressed ahead of schedule, including sort of a beta version of bringing light scattering on Empower.  \n Now keep in mind, right, Q1 is a really small quarter and for instruments, especially and when things sort of slip a couple of weeks here and there, it causes that distortion. And that's why we sort of tweaked down Wyatt to 1.1% versus 1.3% M&A contribution. But way that acquisition is going, we are super happy where we are in that journey and really look forward to bringing light scattering into QA/QC. So Matt, thanks for your question. And look, I mean, we executed well to finish at the higher end of our Q1 guide, right? And that sort of keeps us on track for our full year sales guide. And as Udit discussed, our Q2 guide is essentially 10% higher than Q1, which has been sort of our historical trend pre-pandemic. And our second half guide is also very much consistent with how we've historically performed, which is a 45-55 split. So we generally expect the breakdown between Q3 and Q4 to also follow that historical trend for 2024. Yes. I mean on a growth basis, it looks a little weird, but that's because of last year, right? The weakness progressively stepped in China and pretty much Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental meaningful bad news out of China, but a lot of that was not reflected in Q1 and Q2. And that's why it sort of it plays out in the growth purely from the baseline effect mostly from China. So look, I mean, great question. As you sort of travel through last year, Q2, Q3, Q4, we saw weakness creep in on different elements of the pharma business in China. But as I said earlier in Q3 and Q4, there was no incremental bad news out of China, and that trend sort of has continued into Q1. And so in a way, what played out, what you see in terms of the decline, is largely baseline related where China, from a pharma point of view has bottomed out and there is no incremental headwind coming into the business. \n But we are also not seeing sort of growth in activity, both in CDMOs or in branded generics or in biotechs in China. So if anything, let's call it stable. Now on your second point, which is around the BIOSECURE Act, I mean, look, with the weakness that we observed in 2023, the baseline is largely corrected in China for submarkets like CDMOs, right, including Wuxi. \n We are -- what we are seeing in the market is customers are taking proactive measures to secure their supply chain. And when they are doing that, our service organization, which is really well respected in the industry and plays a pivotal role in these tech transfers are deeply embedded when these moves happen, right? I mean, our role is to support customers in their pursuits and our customers really value our support when they go through situations like this and move products from one site to another. Dan, yes, I mean, look, the product mix is helping at this point, especially given lower instrument mix, that's contributing about 30 basis points. But keep in mind, there was also a good 70 to 80 basis points of FX headwind that we offsetted, right? So the remaining delta is favorably coming from price and some of the productivity initiatives in manufacturing. Yes. Look, I mean, already in Q1, we put good numbers on board and continued our good financial performance. As you get into second half of the year, keep in mind, the proactive cost actions that we took are already in the baseline, and there will be some headwind as we accrue for bonuses. So you may not see meaningful margin expansion in the second half, net of those 2 effects, but we would have mostly covered our ground for the 20 to 30 basis points of margin expansion mostly in the first half. So we will still end up delivering an adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 to 30 basis points. Yes. Look, I mean, where we stand at this point, one may say, look, your Q2 guidance is conservative given there was some delay in budget releases in Q1. And we've been prudent there just to stay with our historical norm, right? Q3, Q4, we have some visibility in CRM. But the sales cycle, as you know, is 6, 9 months, so you don't have all the visibility, but it's still in line with the historical pattern, and we are seeing increased activity at early stages in our pipeline, which we think will convert into orders as the year progresses, right? \n If you look at ex-China pretty much across these quarters, it is on a 5-year stack basis, a little lower, mid-single digits. So again, as Udit said, there is no noise ex-China. And really what plays out in the growth guide is how progressively the decline in China translates to a modest increase in the second half of the year, and that's what we are modeling. There could be upside on China, if China performs well. And we did some of that in our guide where we saw a little bit better China, and we derisk the remainder of the guide. \n On your second question on the margin, I mean, as I said earlier, right, a lot of the cost work we did last year is in the second half baseline. So you're going to see very modest, if any, margin expansion in the second half, but we would have covered most of the ground on the 20 to 30 basis points of full year margin expansion in the first half. And China, I mean, stimulus is not in our guide. We expect very little towards the end of the year, if any, because a lot of things need to be worked out there. But we are super encouraged by what the government is doing, both in terms of the size and the tenure of the stimulus and the secondary effect it will have on the local mentality and purchase patterns."
