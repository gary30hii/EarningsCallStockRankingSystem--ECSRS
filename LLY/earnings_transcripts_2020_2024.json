Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Kevin Hern. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Hern: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2020 Earnings Call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President, Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Biomedicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Sara Smith and Lauren Durfy of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. The additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019, and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our 2020 results.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. On our guidance call in December 2019, we provided a framework for how we are thinking about the 2020 to 2025 period, noting our expectations to continue to deliver top-tier revenue growth and operating margin growing into the mid-to high 30s while continuing to increase R&D productivity. As we met with investors throughout 2020, it was evident that while there was good insight into management's expectations for the next few years, investors were increasingly focused on our ability to grow in the second-half of this coming decade. In the past two months, we have begin \u2013 we have begun to deliver answers to that question, with positive data for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab, each with a chance to significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe these are three of the most important and exciting pipeline assets in our industry and provide meaningful support for Lilly's growth potential beyond 2025. Together with Verzenio data in early breast cancer last summer, we have significantly reinforced our growth prospects for the midterm and upgraded them for the long-term. While these readouts drive incredible momentum for our future, I am also pleased with the way that we delivered in a complex and challenging 2020. Our 2020 revenue enabled us to exceed our midterm revenue goal of 7% CAGR from the years 2015 to 2020. Turning to the quarter. Revenue grew an impressive 22% versus Q4 2019, or 20% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 24 percentage points despite continued pricing headwinds and demand pressure from the effects of COVID-19. Excluding bamlanivimab, revenue grew over 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continue to drive this volume and our revenue, now representing 55% of our base business. We continue to advance our productivity agenda in Q4 as the combination of strong revenue growth and modest operating expense growth drove significant margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 33% with and without COVID-19 therapies, an improvement of roughly 650 basis points versus Q4 2019. With continued margin expansion for the quarter and full-year, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 on our business in 2020, we would have achieved our midterm operating margin as a percent of revenue goal of 31%. We're proud to have delivered nearly 1,000 basis points of operating margin expansion since 2016. In addition to the strong business performance, we achieved multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include the positive results I noted for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab; the FDA granting emergency use authorizations for bamlanivimab and baricitinib to help patients with COVID-19; the submission of empagliflozin for heart failure in people with reduced injection fraction in the U.S., Europe and Japan, this is done in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; and the submission of Verzenio in early breast cancer in the U.S. During Q4, we put our growing operating cash flow to work, announcing a 5% increase in the dividend for the third consecutive year, as well as continuing to pursue external innovation to augment future growth prospects with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. This acquisition adds a promising new modality for Lilly by creating a gene therapy program that will be anchored by Prevail's portfolio of clinical-stage and late-preclinical-stage gene therapies across Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moving to Slides 5 and 6. You'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. In November, we announced that Arti Shaw, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer, will retire in the first-half of this year after 27 years of service to Lilly. She's been an invaluable member of our Executive Committee and a leader who really models our values. In addition to leading the development of our digital information strategy, she has developed and mentored talent throughout the organization and demonstrated a deep care for the patients we aim to serve. I want to thank Arti for her many contributions to Lilly. And now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 and full-year results.\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in Q4 and 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 22% this quarter compared to Q4 2019 and increased 7%, excluding bamlanivimab sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 130 basis points to 78.6%. Excluding the impact of bamlanivimab revenue and the related manufacturing costs, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.9%, in line with Q4 2019 performance. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 8% as reduced activity due to COVID-19 and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. R&D expenses increased 16%, driven by investment in COVID-19 therapies. Net of COVID-19 expenses, baseline R&D was relatively flat, and total operating expenses decreased over 5% compared to Q4 2019. Operating income increased 53% compared to Q4 2019 as revenue growth far outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 33% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 therapies, operating income grew 34% in the quarter and the operating margin for our base business was 32.7% for Q4. Other income and expense was income of $477 million this quarter compared to income of $206 million in Q4 2019, driven by investment gains on public equities. As we noted in our Q3 earnings call, beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We have posted a supplemental investor workbook for Q4 on that basis to enable you to have an apples-to-apples comparison as we move into 2021 and compare to 2020 non-GAAP performance. Our tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 180 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by net discrete tax items in both quarters. At the bottom line, net income increased 58%, while earnings per share increased 59%. Net of COVID-19 therapies, net income and earnings per share increased 43%. Moving to Slide 8. You can see these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year. In spite of the ongoing demand impact from the pandemic, we grew the top line at 10% or 6%, excluding bamlanivimab. Excluding COVID-19 therapies, our operating margin expanded by 300 basis points contributing to 30% EPS growth while continuing to invest behind our newer products and pipeline. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 20% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 24%, partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest impact on revenue growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7%, excluding bamlanivimab. For the base business, volume growth of 11% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. Pricing was a 5% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter driven primarily by increased rates to maintain excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases, largely for diabetes, and to a lesser extent, by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Taltz, which was driven by the access win at ESI. Segment mix was not a major driver of U.S. price performance in the fourth quarter as increased utilization in more highly rebated government segments was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment primarily for Trulicity and Humalog. Like Q4, the full impact of price was also a headwind of 5%, consistent with our 2020 expectations for a mid-single-digit net price decline in the U.S. While the midterm price trends are stable at present, given the increasing variability in payer mix, we expect to see quarterly variability in our U.S. price impact during the course of 2021. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 12% in constant currency driven by 9% volume growth and a favorable impact from price. Volume growth was led by Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the continued uptake of our key growth products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021. In Japan, revenue decreased 10% in constant currency driven primarily by decreased volume in post-patent expiry products, Cialis and Forteo, as well as by a modest pricing headwind due to the government-mandated price decreases that went into effect in March 2020. Japan is experiencing the impact of countercyclical patent expiries with Cialis, Strattera and Cymbalta LOEs impacting growth in 2020 and likely in 2021. In China, revenue grew 31% in constant currency driven by 57% volume growth driven by Tyvyt and partially offset by pricing concessions for the government-sponsored programs, which drove Tyvyt significant volume growth. We are excited about the momentum of our China oncology business, and we are looking forward to continued growth for Tyvyt and the launch uptake for Verzenio. We're also pleased that Trulicity and Olumiant were added to the NRDL as of January 2021. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 6% in constant currency driven by strong volume from Trulicity and Olumiant as well as three percentage points of growth coming from bamlanivimab sales to Canada. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. These newer medicines delivered nearly 14 percentage points of growth this quarter, with bamlanivimab also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth in our key products was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as by reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehring Ingelheim. This impact will sunset as we move into 2021. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.6 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 55% of our base revenue. Amidst the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we are encouraged by the performance of our key growth products in 2020. Trulicity grew 23%, adding nearly $1 billion last year to finish with over $5 billion in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in the U.S. and exiting 2020 with a nearly 47% share of total prescriptions amidst the reacceleration of growth for injectable GLP-1s. Taltz grew 31% to nearly $1.8 billion in revenue, outgrowing the U.S. market in both dermatology and rheumatology and entering 2021 with best-in-class access that provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. Jardiance crossed $1 billion in sales for Lilly's share revenue in 2020, ending the year at nearly 60% of total SGLT2 prescriptions in the U.S. and driving encouraging growth for the class, as we look forward to the regulatory action for FrEF and the readout for HFrEF this year. And Verzenio revenue grew nearly 60% in 2020 to over $900 million, significantly outgrowing the CDK 4/6 class growing six percentage points in total prescriptions while nearly doubling new-to-brand share of market on the heels of positive data readouts for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer in 2019 and early breast cancer in 2020. Our key growth products will continue to drive Lilly's strong growth outlook in 2021. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2020, we invested over $8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after-tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, we also announced a 15% dividend increase for the third consecutive year, demonstrating our confidence in the outlook for the Company. We are focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. We will remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing, where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future growth prospects. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are affirming our non-GAAP guidance, and we've updated our GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the Precision Biosciences, Merus and Asahi Kasei agreements, which with reported earnings per share for 2021, now expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75. The impact of the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics will be updated on our next quarterly call and will only impact Lilly's GAAP guidance for 2021. There will be no change to our 2021 guidance for R&D expense or non-GAAP EPS as a result of this transaction. As we move into this New Year, and as we noted on our guidance call, we continue to experience suppressed demand due to the pandemic with several key therapeutic classes still below our pre-COVID baseline. We remain committed to ensuring we are doing our part to limit COVID-19 exposure for physicians, patients and our employees as cases surge in the U.S. and around the world. At present, most of our HCP interactions in the U.S. and many other major markets are virtual. While this may have a near-term impact on new-to-brand performance, we continue to believe our approach is the appropriate posture as we support health care professionals navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccination to enable a return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. In addition, our year-end 2020 inventory build was approximately a $120 million higher than Q4 2019, which was driven by 2019 having a lower-than-typical year-end stocking. This primarily impacts our diabetes products as well as Taltz and Alimta. We anticipate this inventory will burn off in Q1 2021 like normal historical patterns. As I noted on our guidance call, we also experienced significant COVID-19-related stocking benefit of roughly $250 million in Q1 2020. Given those divergent year-over-year inventory trends, we expect inventory patterns will have a negative impact on revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the first quarter of 2021. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our full year outlook for 2021 and have increased confidence in our mid- and long-term outlook given our recent high-quality pipeline readouts. So, now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Josh. We had an exciting start to 2021 as we read out positive results for gentimab in the Phase 2 Trailblazer Al study. Lilly has spent more than 30 years dedicated to finding solutions for Alzheimer's disease, and we are proud of our progress in advancing the science and providing hope for patients and their families suffering from this devastating disease. On Slide 14, you can see our key takeaways from this exciting trial. We are encouraged by the strong efficacy results, where in a relatively small study, we overcame the scale of the study with precision on patient enrollment and a very potent and effective plaque-clearing drug, becoming the first-ever disease modification study to hit statistical significance on its primary endpoint, with a slowing of decline by 32% relative to placebo as measured by the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale. ADAS is a clinical composite tool, combining two well-accepted measures in Alzheimer's disease: ADAS-Cog 13 for cognition; and ADCS IADL, Instrumental Activities of Data Living, for function. While the study was not powered for assessing multiple endpoints, we're very encouraged by the consistent improvements observed on all pre-specified secondary endpoints for cognition and function compared to placebo though ganitumab did not reach statistical significance on every secondary endpoint. The consistency across time points and across statistical methods was very encouraging, particularly the disease progression model, which is becoming more accepted by the scientific community. In addition, we saw rapid and deep amyloid plaque clearance for ganitumab-treated patients who, on average, showed an 84 centiloid reduction of amyloid plaque at 76 weeks compared to a baseline of 108 centiloids. Since below 25 centiloids is a negative amyloid scan, this means that the average ganitumab-treated patient had a negative scan by the end of the study. Finally, the safety profile was consistent with observations from Phase 1. Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA were observed, which is consistent with plaque-clearing antibodies. In the ganitumab treatment Group, ARIA E occurred in 27% of treated participants with an overall incidence of 6% of patients experiencing symptomatic ARIA E. We look forward to sharing the full results of Trailblazer AS at the ADPD 2021 virtual meeting on March 13, and we plan to have an investor call at 11 a.m. on March 15. We hope to reproduce and extend these exciting findings in our second pivotal donanemab trial, TRAILBLAZER ALS 2, an 18-month study which began enrolling patients last year. At present, the study is expected to complete enrollment later this year with nearly twice as many patients as the first TRAILBLAZER trial. We'll be engaging regulators to finalize the patient numbers and statistical plans for TRAILBLAZER 2, and we hope the exciting results from TRAILBLAZER 1 will increase patient interest and expedite enrollment. TRAILBLAZER 2 was designed last year prior to TRAILBLAZER 1 data. And while the design is similar, at that time, we incorporated a few differences, including CDR sum of the boxes was moved to the primary endpoint for this larger trial, while ADAS becomes a key secondary endpoint. We added a high tau group and we include a blood-based screening for enrollment using the P-tau biomarker. We look forward to sharing the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data and discussing next step for ganitumab with regulators. Moving to Slide 15. As we discussed in-depth on Tuesday's call, there've been a number of developments for our COVID-19 antibodies since our last earnings call, which I will highlight only briefly now. In November, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab as a treatment for COVID-19. We also submitted a request for EUA for bamlanivimab and antisemab together, which remain under review based on Phase 2 data from the BLAZE 1 trial. Since the EUA for bamlanivimab, we've shipped approximately 1 million doses. We will have over 1 million additional doses available through mid-2021 for use around the world. This week, the U.S. government committed to purchase 500,000 of those additional doses by the end of March. Should any EUA be granted for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, we expect to be able to supply in collaboration with Amgen up to 1 million doses of antisemab for administration with bamlanivimab together by mid-2021, with 250,000 doses available already in the first quarter this year. In just the past eight days, we've shared Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 2 prevention trial where bamlanivimab showed up to an 80% reduction of risk of COVID-19 for nursing home residents; Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 1 trial for eisemanab together with bamlanivimab, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization or death among high-risk COVID-19 patients, providing further support for the EUA request for their joint administration. Importantly, there were no COVID-19-related deaths in the antibody treatment arms from these two pivotal data sets. After having seen these results, Lilly has decided we will no longer conduct placebo-controlled studies in high-risk patients. Initial results from the ongoing BLAZE 4 Phase 2 trial provide viral load and PK/PD data, which demonstrated that lower doses, including bamlanivimab 700 milligrams and tiseramab 1,400 milligrams together, are similar to the 2,800 milligram doses of those antibodies administered together. We expanded the BLAZE 4 trial to also evaluate the administration of bamlanivimab AB with VER-7831 in collaboration with Vier and GSK, reinforcing our commitment to collaborate across the industry to treat current and future strains of COVID-19. And yesterday, we received authorization from the FDA to update preparation and administration instructions in response to feedback from frontline nurses and doctors to enable flexibility, which can reduce infusion times considerably. These updates can shorten infusion times to as little as 16 minutes. We're pleased with the potential impact our neutralizing antibodies can have, and we're working diligently to make them available to patients around the world. While the exciting progress with donanemab and the COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies has dominated Lilly's news in the past few weeks, we have continued to robustly advance the rest of our pipeline. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submissions Dave noted for Jardiance and Verzenio, the submission of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan, the initiation of a Phase 3 trial for empagliflozin in post-myocardial infarction patients. The movement of two pain assets into Phase 2 and the introduction of eight new Phase 1 assets, including our first clinical assets from two new modalities for Lilly: the siRNA molecule, ANGPTL3 from our collaboration with Dicerna and two gene therapy molecules from Prevail. In fact, we ended 2020 with a total of 17 new Phase 1 starts for the year, surpassing 2019's total of 16 first human doses, which was the highest number of new clinical starts for Lilly in a decade. Considering the significant challenges we faced in 2020, including temporarily stopping the initiation of new clinical studies, this is a remarkable achievement. It speaks to the resilience and determination of our R&D organization during challenging times. Moving to Slide 17. We show a final tally of how we finish 2020 versus the key events that we expected to occur. Since our guidance call in mid-December, we had submissions for selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan, Jardiance for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction in the United States and Verzenio for early breast cancer in the United States. The sea of blue checkmarks emphasizes the sheer quantity of pipeline advancements in 2020. However, my take away from the year past is that I'm delighted with the quality represented here, including potentially practice-changing data for type 2 diabetes, for hematologic tumors; for early breast cancer, the launch of a first-in-class RET inhibitor; as well as the emergency use authorizations for two medicines to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the significant achievements delivered in 2020. As we transition into 2021, I'd like to note that Josh Bilenker will be leaving his position as CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly to explore other interests and endeavors. We're grateful to Josh for his contributions to human health, both at Loxo and in his time with Lilly. We look forward to working with him in a consulting role. I'm very pleased to announce that Jacob Bernardin is assuming the CEO role, continuing to work alongside Nisha Nanda and David Heyman, ensuring leadership continuity in maintaining the strategy and operating model for Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Jake is a very highly talented leader, and this move allows him to continue to grow his responsibilities for the benefit of Lilly and Loxo. Moving to Slide 18. You can see the expected events for 2021, including the donanemab data and upcoming disclosure I previously mentioned. A number of other major readouts are expected this year, including the remainder of the tirzepatide Phase 3 program, where we are looking forward to building on the SURPASS 1 data we disclosed late last year. The Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's, in a trial similar in design to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several potential Phase 3 readouts in immunology; and the results of empagliflozin for HFrEF. Based on the recent high-quality pipeline data readouts for ganitumab, tirzepatide and LOXO-305, we entered 2021 optimistic by the impact these assets could have on patients. And we're focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients. Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Well, thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we made in 2020. 2020 was a remarkable year as Lilly worked to fulfill its purpose in new and important ways. In addition to many contributions in the fight against the global pandemic, our business grew 10% in 2020 driven by strong volume growth from our key growth products launched since 2014. These products now account for more than half of our revenue for the first time. We continued our productivity journey, delivering nearly 300 basis points of operating margin expansion for our base business. We made significant progress on our innovation based strategy, with LOXO-305, tirzepatide and Verzenio early breast cancer readouts, delivering potential category-changing data. While January's donanemab top line success was a first in Alzheimer's. With EUAs for bamlanivimab and Olumiant to combat COVID-19 and bolt-on acquisitions of Dermira and Prevail book ending the year, the past 12 months have been an exceptional example of Lilly's success in leveraging internal and external innovation. We returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, and we will have another meaningful dividend increase, which we announced in December, reflecting significant confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. All of this was accomplished against the headwind of a pandemic that is still raging. While the New Year does not free us from that near-term challenge, our long-term outlook has never been stronger. This concludes the prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for the Q&A.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many colors as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Tony, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. Dan, on donanemab, I know you're planning on having regulatory discussions, but beyond expanding TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, is it reasonable to start a third study just to expand the safety database in the treatment experience? And then, Josh, you mentioned you're still seeing commercial impact from COVID. What would you say are the franchises that were mostly affected in 2020? And maybe just review your assumptions for normalization of some of those in 2021? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Geoff. Dan and Josh?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Geoff. Your question is whether we'd consider starting a third donanemab study to improve the safety database. No, we haven't considered that at present. Of course, as we said, our next step is to discuss the dataset we have with regulators. I think if we determine that we need more patience, the place to do that is a TRAILBLAZER-2 study. With respect to additional studies, I think, there could be opportunities to explore other populations and we're working through those possibilities right now, but we don't see that that necessary for this current population.\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Geoff. I think when we look across our therapeutic areas, it's relatively consistent at this point that we're still not quite back to new to grand prescriptions in key areas, like immunology, pain and diabetes, although the diabetes numbers are looking stronger as we get here into January, but I think we're still seeing some suppressed demand. Physicians have, I think, in most markets has figured out how to see patients safely, and we're seeing nothing like what we saw back in April and May in the U.S. So, I think we just have to be cautious as we get into the first quarter and realize that the more complex treatments have some higher degree of variability against them and that includes starting new patients in areas like migraine. I think maintenance has been good throughout the pandemic. So, we do expect it, as we get through the first-half of this year, we'll see returned to fully normal levels. But I think it's fair to assume that in the first quarter, we'll still be, in many of the therapeutic areas a little bit below pre-COVID baselines in terms of new prescription starts.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks, guys.\nDave Ricks: Probably worth mentioning, Geoff, as well as Durham, because I think that one also, you see some suppression in new patients starts, not affecting our share anything but just the overall volume in the category.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Geoff, thanks for your question. Next caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: Thank you. A couple on donanemab. Investors are naturally wondering what the odds are that you could file for approval based on this first Phase 2 trial. To me, it seems highly unlikely given the size of the trial and the different subgroups, but just wondering, if you can share your latest thoughts on that? And then, Dan, your view of the need to continue to knock down what is sometimes described in the industry as toxic oligomers, which is what you might achieve by giving monoclonal chronically well after patients have already seen plaque normalization?\nKevin Hern: Hi, Tim. We'll go to Dan for both of those.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Tim, so your first question is on the possibility of approval from a single study in Alzheimer's disease. Look, we - in general, we don't disclose our back and forth with FDA or other regulators. In this case, of course, we said that next steps are discussions with regulators. So clearly, that hasn't happened yet. Still, we understand the regulatory threshold traditionally has been adequate and well controlled trial that means more than one trial. In this case, we have a single adequate and well controlled trial in Alzheimer's disease. That, as I said, has not been the standard in this area. Of course, in other disease areas, notably in oncology, drugs can be approved from a single trial, usually, that's an accelerated approval. Usually, it's a group that's well defined by pathologic characteristics and biomarkers. Usually, there's dramatic pathologic response as well as clinical outcomes. Of course, that's also true in the case of this donanemab trial, but again, oncology is quite different than Alzheimer's disease. Your second question was on the question of toxic oligomers. It's long been unclear what is the toxic species of a beta, is it monomers? is it oligomers? Is it plaques? This antibody was designed to be exquisitely specific for amyloid plaques. We don't think it binds oligomers. And thereby, the efficacy \u2013 therefore, the efficacy we see here seems to imply that it's the plaques that are the toxic species rather than the like oligomers. However, we can't rule out that these two things are in equilibrium with each other and perhaps by clearing plaques, you remove oligomers as well.\nKevin Hern: Thank you, Dan. And Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Dan, in the prior studies, the IADRS DAS endpoint, the composite they use in donanemab, it didn't correlate very well with CDR sum of the boxes. But I did find it interesting that the most recent EXPEDITION3 trial for solanezumab did have high concordance between this new composite versus CDR sum of the boxes. I guess what I'm wondering is how should we be thinking about whether IADRS versus CDR sum of the boxes correlate closely or not? Or is it more a function of the more recent trials where CDR does, in fact, correlate very closely with IADRS? I'm thinking about that heading into your donanemab trial. The other one I had is, you have this tau antibody Phase 3 coming up this year. Maybe if you could remind us how's this tau-mab similar or different than some of the other ones because the progress on this target has not been quite good to date. And I saw your trial was pushed out a little bit as well, but it'd be very helpful to have any color? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Umer. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Great, thanks. Umer, for your first question on IADRS and its correlation with CDR. Look, when we think about an endpoint for any clinical trial, there's really two things that make an endpoint, a good endpoint. One is the statistical validation behind it. So in other words, is it reliable across different patients across different time points, across different trials, we put together a lot of data that support that. Second, is it meaningful for patients? And in this course - case, of course, we believe that that's inherently true. This is a composite of two things that are widely used, both thought to be important and meaningful ADAS-Cog and activities of daily living, obviously, activities of daily living inherently meaningful for patients. Now, why do we pick IADRS versus CDR to be the primary outcome of the study? That should be obvious, it's because we believe that IADRS would be more sensitive for measuring decline and therefore more sensitive for measuring a drug effect. That's based on all of that statistical validation data that we did. If ADAS and some of the boxes were perfectly well correlated then ADAS couldn't be better, couldn't be more powerful. And yet, I'm telling you that our assumption going into this trial was that it would be. So of course, different outcomes will have some correlation, but they won't be perfectly correlated. Based on what we saw in this trial, I think we haven't changed our thinking on outcomes, and we still think ADAS is a very valid and important outcome for Alzheimer's trials. Of course, that's a discussion to be had with regulators in the scientific community. With the zagotenemab, this is our anti-tau antibody. Just as donanemab was a different type of anti-amyloid beta based on its specificity for plaque, zagotenemab is a different kind of anti-tau antibody. It's highly specific for aggregated tau. Now, we think that's particularly important in the case of tau because there's a lot of soluble monomeric tau, and tau antibodies, like any other antibody, not much of it gets in the brain. So if you have a lot of monomer and a little bit of antibody, it could sop up all of your antibody and not have left to go after what we think is the more important species, aggregated tau. So, we'll have to wait and see. Of course, this is a field that is younger than anti-amyloid therapies, but we've taken a lot of things we learned from anti-amyloid, applied them to anti-tau, and we're quite looking forward to getting that data later this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Two questions. Investor expectations are quite high for donanemab in terms of sales potential. Lilly knows the full data for TRAILBLAZER and also the largely failed A-beta antibody landscape better than any other company. Based on what you've said, including that donanemab will be a driver in 25 3 30, it sounds as though you are fully comfortable with these multibillion-dollar expectations. Is that the conclusion you want to leave us with? Secondly, LOXO-305 looks like it could be best-in-class in oncology, and the safety looks favorable. Has Lilly rolled out non-oncology indications for 305, potentially MS, or perhaps for the sister BTK that you also have?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Dave for the first question and then Dan for the second one.\nDave Ricks: Yes. Steve, I mean, we don't comment on analyst models or forecast, and we never would. So I can't directly answer your question. I guess what I can say is, we've invested in Alzheimer's for 30-plus years and spent a lot of money, as you point out, mostly failing, because there's a huge unmet medical need, and we believe that investment is justified based on the size of market. But we're not able to say today, donanemab is the answer, has a path to market, et cetera. We're not saying any of that. We're looking forward to the ADPD presentation coming up. The field will survey that data and make your own conclusions. And we need to talk to the FDA in a formal way about the path forward, and then we'll get to sales forecast later, but it's just not possible to answer a question like the one you asked.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. The second question, more straightforward. LOXO-305 is a really uniquely specific reversal BTK inhibitor with great drug properties. That's why it's generating such remarkable data in oncology. You're asking a question that we thought a lot about, which is, could this also translate to being a highly differentiated molecule in immunology? I think in this case, we would not pursue the same molecule. I think this is down the road far enough in oncology. This will be an oncology molecule. But you raised the question of whether we'd be interested in generating a sister molecule, as you said, for immunology indications. That's certainly something we are considering.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: Congrats on the update. I have two questions, please. First, when do you expect to have clarity from the FDA on whether Lilly can file with the single small Phase 2 trial on donanemab? And then second, would Lilly consider changing the primary endpoint for TRAILBLAZER 2, which is currently CDR sum of boxes?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Thanks, Dave. Your first question is on the potential for filing, which I think we addressed before. We haven't had those discussions with the regulators. Of course, we move quickly to understand the data and schedule discussions with regulators around the world. As I said before, the regulatory standard is adequate and well-controlled trials, so two trials there. But certainly, we'll be interested to hear what regulators say.\nKevin Hern: And the second one is, can you see the change over the primary endpoint?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Oh, yes, yes. Sorry, Dave. So the second question there is would we change the endpoint. Yes, of course, we can consider it. I think we look at the totality of data that we get from TRAILBLAZER 1, and that will inform our decisions, as well as conversations with regulators. But so far, we haven't seen anything that leads us to make that decision to change it.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Dave, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Ziment: This is Dan on for Terence. Just one from us. On LOXO-305 that you could discuss if you believe there's a path to filing for approval on the Phase 1/2 data? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Yes. So, we'll go to Anne White for that one.\nAnne White: Well, thanks, Terence, for the question. And we're obviously very excited about the data, both in CLL and CL. And so we do have ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential for accelerated approval. Obviously, in this place, the single-arm accelerated approvals for heme malignancies can be challenging. And so that really require -- was going to require further discussions with regulators. So we can't commit yet on submissions, timing or which indications, but be assured that we'll continue those conversations. And we couldn't be more excited about the data, as Dan mentioned. I think this molecule really started as a molecule focus on C41 mutations, and then as we saw the data and the performance in the broader populations remarkable. So, we'll keep that with conversations going, and we'll keep you posted.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Dan, thanks our next question. Next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Just one on donanemab and then just one other one. What are your thoughts on the high-tau population? I guess just based on what you saw from TRAILBLAZER, is there a strong rationale the drug could also work in some of these patients? And maybe just give us a sense of what percent of patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 we should expect to come from that group? Then my second question was just did make some changes to your 340B program reimbursement last year. Maybe just remind us the scope of that business in your portfolio. And have there been any either challenges or push backs with the implementation of that? And how we should be kind of thinking about 340B as we go through 2021?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for the first question and then Josh on 340B.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Got it. Thank you, Chris, for the question about the high-tau population. A notable feature of the TRAILBLAZER trial is that we excluded patients who had too much tau in their brain. We believe that people who have the highest tau or it's spread throughout their brain are past the point of no return at least for an amyloid-directed therapy. Of course, as we fully analyze this data, and hopefully, even in time for the upcoming presentation, we'll understand what we're seeing in this current data set with respect to baseline tau levels predicting response to therapy, as we see that, that could lead us to be either more excited or less excited about including high-tau patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 study. And so that is something that is still very much open. As we see that data and understand it, we could think about changing the design there. In terms of the percent of patients that are impacted here, it sort of depends on how you cut it. If you start with all of the early Alzheimer's patients, plus -- mild AD plus MCI, that's about 4.5 million in the U.S. and double that in Europe and Japan combined. Many of those patients with amyloid negative. We've shown that before. So you take about one-third out for that. A small fraction of them will be amyloid positive but no tau at all. We didn't include those patients. And then a slightly larger fraction will be in that tau high group. So once you've excluded all those patients, we've said it's sort of 30% to 45% of that mild AD to MCI population that would meet these enrollment criteria in TRAILBLAZER 1.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Chris, on 340B, what we said is if you look over the last 10 years, the 340B segment has been among the fastest-growing, certainly across the industry but for our business as well, and it rivals the size of Medicaid in our U.S. business, so about 10% of the business now. Of course, the change we made was to go back to the legislated intent and to provide the discounts to the actual hospitals that provide care and to exclude contract pharmacy that have grown overtime And when we look at that business, it's probably about half of the businesses in these contracted pharmacy. So that's where we've made the change, to not provide the pricing there. Now, we do have a process where those contracted pharmacy can apply and we've said for insolence, as long as they can demonstrate that they're passing on the entire pricing that they're still eligible to participate. When we look at all that together, we knew that that's where we implemented in September. We knew there would be challenges, and we're seeing those challenges come, but I think in terms of patient impacts, we haven't seen much yet. So, we're seeing the fact that the discounts are being provided as per our change, but we don't think it's impacting patient care at this point. So everything we're seeing so far is consistent with the decision we made. We knew it would be a difficult decision to implement. We knew there would be some customer concerns. We knew there'd be legal challenges, but I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is consistent with the guidance we've given for 2021, which is that we would expect this portion of the 340b program to moderate in growth and provide a two to three point price tailwind for us in 2021. So I think we're on track for that at this point.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: So I just wanted to follow up on the one donanemab question, which is, Dan, can you just give us a little bit of color on the magnitude of blinding in this study, given the fact that patients obviously had almost absolute clearing of their amyloid plaques? And your confidence that the behavior of the placebo arm was consistent with the benefits of monitoring both tau and amyloid? And then the second question, just wanted to get a bit of an update on Verzenio and how Verzenio is tracking relative to your expectations. I think we're starting to see fits and starts, I guess, to some degree in terms of capturing incremental market share. But directionally, it seems positive. Just trying to get a sense of where Lilly thinks the uptake could go in metastatic disease? And then, how ultimately an approval of the adjuvant opportunity can impact sales or your market share going forward? Is that really the big driver? Or are you already seeing meaningful changes in metastatic market share? Thanks so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan for the first question and Anne for the second.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thank you, Seamus, for those very thoughtful questions focused on that blinding of the study. We said before that TRAILBLAZER 1, we carried this study out with the quality that we typically use for regulatory pivotal studies, fully blinded, double-blinded study. You raised the possibility that there could be some unintentional unblinding as a result of amyloid clearance. We don't see that that's possible. Patients don't know or feel the clearance of amyloid in their brain directly. And investigators wouldn't have seen that the results of the PET scan themselves. The other potential in any Alzheimer's study for in over blinding is ARIA E because sometimes that is something that can cause a side effect. And we commented on the 6% of patients that had symptomatic ARIA E or so. I think that's certainly an important analysis, I think, in every study in Alzheimer's disease is to look at the drug effect with and without ARIA patients. And certainly, that's something that we hope to have complete and be able to share in March. And then finally, you asked about the behavior of the placebo arm. That's a great question. Really, when we saw this data that was the first thing I wanted to look at. Sometimes, you have small studies that look promising. It's because your placebo arm did worse than typical. And here, we said -- we've communicated a high level of confidence and encouragement based on the data. So that excludes that possibility. This placebo arm is not behaving aberrantly. That's not what's driving the effect. Again, we'll get into the details of that in March, but very, very pleased with the performance of the placebo arm here.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anne?\nAnne White: Yes. Thanks for the question on Verzenio. So as you noted, 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically meaningful data for Verzenio. And then our shares, as a result, I think, continue to improve. While obviously, no CDK is yet approved in the EVC setting, we do think that this readout is particularly drew attention to the market class. So that said, we're really confident that the current trends are a result of our strong execution and our focus on NBC and then the -- particularly logistically significant OS data, which a key competitor in the space didn't have. As we compare Q4 '19 to Q4 '20, it was really a remarkable period of growth, as you said, for Verzenio. We saw TRx increase of 6% worldwide revenue growth of 57% and U.S. growth of 36%. And what we're hearing pretty repeatedly now from thought leaders is that they're seeing more and more that Verzenio is a differentiated agent. So obviously, we've shared that in MEMS, we feel we have higher CDK4 activity than -- versus others, differentiated continuous dosing, a monotherapy indication, and then obviously, the data that we saw in MONARCH 2 with the primary endocrine-resistant population. So I think all of that is really playing into the growth that we're seeing in the MVC market. And so, we'll expect to continue to see our growth -- our share market grow in that space. On the adjuvant side, as Dave and others mentioned, we did submit to the FDA in other areas at the end of last year. So we look forward to regulatory action later this year. This market size is significant in the fact that it's probably an additional 50% if you match our entry criteria, 50% increase to our current metastatic market in this high-risk adjuvant population. So that's significant. And what's also significant is the duration of treatment will very likely will be longer than a metastatic setting. So patients in the study are treated for 24 months. And right now, we're seeing patients stay on for months on average in the study. And many of the patients are still on study, so I think that number will continue to get longer. So that duration of treatment offers upside as well. But we're incredibly excited about the data. We're looking forward to bringing it to patients as soon as possible. Thanks for the question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Seamus, thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. First, on donanemab. On the issue of whether potentially donanemab could be submitted on the back of the Phase 2 data set that you have. Could you talk to your level of preparedness, particularly manufacturing, given the anticipated demand, but also to the P tau blood test that will potentially be used to define the patients? I'm just trying to understand where you at because there is a scenario by which you could be on the market sooner than perhaps that many may believe. And that's an open observation rather than reflecting any particularly personal view. And then second for Anne, could you talk to your BTK inhibitor 305? I know you're hiring medical liaisons already, which in hematology would suggest that you're optimistic about being able to file in the second half. From your understanding of the community nature of practice for CLL, given the very high tolerability of the drug and the strong efficacy even without a randomized trial, do you believe that this drug could take significant market share in the first BTK refractory or intolerant setting? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. We'll go to Dan for the first question and Anne for the second.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Andrew, you raised an excellent question on all the work that needs to be done to prepare for ganitumab. We actually initiated manufacturing preparedness before we had this data. So, this is something we do at Lilly. We always prepare for success. And so at the same time, that our manufacturing colleagues we're ramping up the anti-COVID antibodies, we asked them to also prepare for donanemab. So that is well underway, and I like what's going on, the progress we're making in manufacturing there. The diagnostic ecosystem also needs work. We started that both ramping up imaging and proceeding along with opportunities to bring the phospho-TAL blood test to more patients. That's both underway, again, started before we had this data and then, of course, is useful whether we're successful in coming to market or whether any other anti-amyloid drug comes to market. So, those are preparations that we're certainly taking.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anne?\nAnne White: Yes. Thanks for the question on 305. So with the MSL population, it's important to remember, this arm of our company talks about the work that's going on in our -- across our portfolio. So this is not just related to 305, but we have other assets in the portfolio that may be heading in this space. So I wouldn't read too much into that, its normal operations to make sure that we're covering the portfolio. But obviously, they do get many questions about 305, the excitement that's out there in treating physicians. And importantly, we have a number of large Phase 3 trials that are starting as well. And as you know, that field force helps us identify high-quality rates to include in those programs. As far as CLL, obviously, the story there is incredibly exciting, and we do think that we have a real contender here. Particularly what we're interested in seeing is what has been seen in the past, certainly in the area of oncology, is that drugs that have a meaningful treatment effect on the same target pathway in patients who have relapsed tend to have sometimes an even more pronounced effect in that first-line setting. And so that's the upside here that is the potential for LOXO-305 is that first-line setting. So this year, we're actually planning to initiate, as you know, four global clinical studies, and three of them are in CLL. And obviously, two of them are in the BTK-pretreated patients, but one is in that really in a head-to-head setting and looking at head-to-head with ibrutinib in CLL. And obviously, this is a riskier study to do. We still feel very confident in the later-line setting, but we do have a belief that this molecule has a lot of potential in the first line, but hence, doing the trials. So obviously, as I said earlier, I can't comment on the regulatory likelihood. Those are ongoing conversations with the FDA. But regardless, we know that in this space, you need randomized clinical trials to really reach the patients that we wish to reach. And so that's -- the intention is to do those trials regardless.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nGregg Gilbert: On the COVID antibodies, Dave, I realize the latest data is quite fresh. But to the extent you're worried that there could be disconnect between the power of the data and the speed of uptake, is there anything that Lilly plans to do proactively to help move this along? I was intrigued by your comments on the prior call about some well-known hospitals being slower than other hospitals to get trained and ready. And I think that was even from before this latest data set. And then maybe for Josh, on that call, it sounded like the upper limit of $2 billion in your guidance is not necessarily set in stone if demand picks up. What's the practical limitation from a manufacturing standpoint as it relates to 2021 for the antibodies? Thanks.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Greg. And we'll go to Dave and then Josh.\nDave Ricks: Okay. Yes, I'll comment. Dan, jump in. I mean we've -- since the beginning, we've been working with health care systems and physicians across the country to enable uptake of the antibodies. I guess it's, in some ways, a test of what happens when you don't have the normal commercial preparation and rollout. This was done via government channels under an EUA. And you see big differences in adoption rates, and I highlighted that it seems to be an inverse relationship between the places you think about advanced medicine and who's actually using this. One of those barriers clearly is conviction on the data. So, I'm really pleased with the data we announced in the last week, and I think it will, has to, increase conviction. And this is also -- there's a class effect here, too. And the fact that other antibodies are demonstrating promise in different settings adds to that data and I think will build confidence. So hopefully, that will change. There's two endorsements as well we hope will change: one is NIH, the other is the Infectious Disease Society. That said, there's tons of practical problems with at scale, infusing people with COVID-19 that have been completely worked out by numerous health systems and not worked out by many, many others. So we work quite a bit with state departments of health, et cetera, to share those practices. The best practice is chart flagging upon positive COVID-19 for at-risk patients, scheduling of appointments, dedicated facilities and staff for high-throughput antibody administration. Where that's happening, they're using a lot of material. And you can almost see actually a reduction in health care utilization. So we're actually running an experiment like that in New Mexico to actually prove it as well as with UnitedHealthcare. But I'm optimistic that we'll see the rate of use grow. It moved from about 20% in December to about double that now. We hope to see more progress going forward.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Yes. Thanks, Greg. So what we've said for this year is guidance range for COVID antibodies is $1 billion to $2 billion. And of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in that. Although with what we've announced this morning on the call, the next agreement that we've signed with the U.S. government, it's probably high probability for $1 billion in the first quarter. That's just the purchase agreements that we already have. I think then to get past that, we have -- based on what we've already committed to in terms of manufacturing, probably about another 500,000 banliminivab doses available in the first half of the year in monotherapy and one million combo. So if we sold all of that and it's weighted heavily towards the U.S. or high-income countries, you could get above $2 billion. But we don't have an EUA with the U.S. government or any other government for the combo yet, and there's a lot to still play out, I think, in terms of vaccine and where these products can be utilized. If we get into the second half of the year, I think we can continue at the pace of production of million-plus doses available per quarter. I don't think the manufacturing piece is going to be as much of a barrier in the second half of the year if we stay on the course of vaccines and otherwise. So clearly, we could be above $2 billion for the year. But there's a lot of uncertainty, and we'll continue to monitor this number and provide updates as we have more agreements and more approvals.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Greg, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Ronny Gal with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRonny Gal: Congratulations on nice result, and I will continue on the tradition of asking one question about donanemab and one other. So on donanemab, I guess the bar that you can see from the FDA is one kind of well internally correlated trial and data support elsewhere. When you look at your program, it looks like the support you could provide is from removal of plaque from earlier trials. And I guess the question for you is, is the understanding that plaque removal is related to clinical benefits solid enough that you can use that as early approval based elsewhere? As for a non-donanemab question, I was going to go back to the 340B prices. The signs are increasing from data there might be an action on this issue before the end of 2021. I just want to kind of confirm that you have not assumed in your model got full impact for the entire year, but there is some sort of a partial year assumption or some sort of a partial impact that you've modeled in.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dan and then Josh.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Ronny. It's a really good question that you're asking, which is how strong is the biomarker evidence here? And how can that be used to support regulatory decisions? I certainly think that's the direction the field is going. So in other words, when I look across all of the trials that have read out, again, this is the first plaque removing antibody that has had a positive study that hit its primary endpoint on the pre-specified statistical analysis. But even the other ones that didn't do that, when you look across the totality of evidence, you get a sense that there's a correlation between plaque removal in general and better cognitive performance. Here, we have probably the most significant plaque removal, the fastest, deepest plaque removal and a very meaningful clinical effect. So it's another point in this sort of dose response curve comparing amyloid plaque removal and cognitive changes across different trials. As that gets filled out further and further by additional experiments, I think amyloid plaque removal could someday become an important surrogate that could aid in the regulatory approval of drugs. Are we there today? I don't know. That's a question for regulators and for the field and something that we certainly have believed in for many years and will continue to take up.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Ronny. As I mentioned earlier, we've guided to a two- to three-point price benefit in 2021 as a function of the 340B changes that we've made. We've been very clear on 340B that the reason for the change is that we're providing discounts that patients don't get. And we want the program needs to be reformed and cleaned up. So our assumption is in 2021, there will be changes. Whether -- and as I mentioned earlier, we also have mechanisms for contract pharmacies to get the discounts. We want to ensure that patients' insulin can get the pass-through discount. So we're assuming in our 2021 guidance that -- not a full financial benefit for the full year that there will be changes in modifications through the year, either as we try to work to ensure patients get the benefits of the discounts or if there are some administrative or legislative changes.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Ryan, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: So I also have a couple on the Alzheimer's theme. So one, just on the second Alzheimer's TRAILBLAZER 2, an issue we've seen with other CNS drugs, maybe not as much in Alzheimer's, but you get these positive results. Everyone gets excited. But then the second trial, you might have to manage more of the placebo response or improperly getting patients into the trial. So I'm just wondering if there's anything you're doing differently or more carefully to make sure for the second trial, you don't have patients who may be getting to the trial that otherwise shouldn't have? Or you say being to manage the placebo response, especially when the endpoint is a sort of clinical rating scale like a CDR sum of the boxes? And then my second questions are unrelated, but I guess partially related to Phase I. You mentioned that to more from where you terminated. I'm just wondering if you can share any details behind that decision.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Dan for both of those.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Vamil. It's a good point you raise. Of course, the placebo effect getting stronger in second trials is something that's been seen a lot in psychiatry and sometimes in pain studies. As you pointed out, I'm not sure it's such a strong effect in Alzheimer's disease. One thing that encourages us here and I think would allow us to see a strong signal even if there is some of that here, is -- maybe two things that encourage us. First is the magnitude of the effect that we're seeing overall, which, as I said, hits test given in the small trial and TRAILBLAZER 2 is much bigger. Second is the consistency across endpoints and time points and statistical methods. That gives us additional confidence as well. With respect to your second question, which was the tau more for the Alzheimer's program here with AC immune, we decided to pursue other promising tau from our candidates from AC immune's research platform. And therefore, we terminated this Phase 1 molecule. That's probably all we see right now.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Congrats on the progress. Dan, I guess I keep up the trend of Alzheimer's first. I guess just can you talk first around your longer-term view towards combination approaches with donanemab, particularly with an anti-tau inhibitor? And then you had good momentum across the pain portfolio in the quarter, and you've got a number of Phase 2 studies reading out with your epiregulin antibody. Any color there on your level of confidence? And if those data represent the key inputs regarding a get-go novocaine decision to Phase 3 or will you need additional Phase 2 work, longer safety data? And any commentary on how you see that coexisting with tanezumab if that's approved?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Carter. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Great. Carter, two good interesting questions. So on combination of purchase for Alzheimer's, I do think that's what the future holds. One of the really neat things about donanemab is that we just treat until amyloid plaques are removed. This is not a drug that we anticipate patients will be taking for the rest of their lives. Once they're clear of amyloid plaques, we stop treatment with this drug. We know from prior data that plaques don't come back. So you can imagine clearing a patient amyloid plaques and then treating them with another mechanism. That could be complementary, for example, in anti-tau drug or an immunomodulatory drug for Alzheimer's disease. So that's certainly something that we're considering and quite likely will pursue in the future. Thanks for noting momentum in the pain space. This is an area that is just so underserved by the pharmaceutical industry. I think there's a variety of reasons including regulatory thresholds, that have held back investment in an area that represents one of the greatest unmet medical needs. This is why patients -- number one reason why patients see doctors because they're in pain. And we know the drawbacks to current therapies. So we designed a platform pain study, which actually tests -- can test multiple molecules against multiple indications, And we can keep funneling molecules in and get results out. Depending on the strength of the efficacy here, that will inform next steps, but we're confident that this study is well designed to whether we have meaningful treatment effects or not. Of course, a holdback in pain, as I said before, is the regulatory bar, which is heavily weighted towards safety. And typically, that takes a large number of patients to discharge. Certainly, tanezumab, a perfect example of that with so many patients studied and a well-understood signal here on both efficacy and potential safety that needs to be resolved for the FDA.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Carter, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kerry Holford with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nKerry Holford: Just a couple left from me, please. Firstly, on Prevail. I wonder if you can talk however more about their decision to acquire here. What strategy is this particular gene therapy platform versus others? And when might we see the data readout for the lead assets? And indeed, when might we see these potentially come to market? And then my second question is just more housekeeping in nature. You talked about a stocking benefit in Q4. I think it was $120 million. Could you detail which drugs that impacted primarily and whether you'd expect an unwind into the next quarter?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Kerry. It's Dan for the question on the Prevail acquisition and then Josh on the stocking question.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Kerry. We're really excited to have Prevail join Lilly. This is a really great gene therapy platform. Why we picked -- and a great team. Those are clearly two of the reasons why we picked Prevail. Also, I think there's just a natural synergy with the work we do at Lilly. We're extremely strong in neuroscience. We have a deep commitment to the space. And therefore, as we thought about what's our entry point into gene therapy, and we believe gene therapy will be an important treatment modality across therapeutic areas in the future, it made sense to enter gene therapy to begin our efforts here in neuroscience. Prevail has got two exciting programs in the clinic already. One is for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations, and it\u2019s a GBA1 gene transfer. There's a lot of phase validity to that kind of approach, and we're looking forward to seeing data from that. The other similarly well-validated target here in frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. And that's also, I think, exciting. In terms of time lines to market, I think it's -- these programs are still very early. We're just in the first few patients here, and we'll have to see what the data showed in port of those time lines.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Kerry. Yes. On inventory, what we've said is if you look at 2020 inventory in the U.S. inventory levels versus Q4 of 2019, we're $120 million higher. We're not concerned about that. 2019 was an unusually low year when you just look at days of stock. So the $120 million is in line with our expectations. But now as we look into Q1 2021, we do expect that $120 million will burn off. And it's across the portfolio. But as you would imagine, Trulicity is one of the products. We see a little bit extra in Taltz, and I think some of this is a function of the anticipation of increased volume for Taltz as a function of the ESI win that'll go in -- that went into effect on January 1. And we also see some on Alimta. We did see some purchasing patterns through the year in oncology. I think some of which was related to the pandemic and some delays in infused products, but those are probably the two biggest products where we see this on. So we would expect that $120 million to burn off in Q1 as it normally does. The other piece, though, that we want to make investors aware is, remember last year in Q1 we saw a $250 million build in inventory on a worldwide basis. This was as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the walk-downs that were coming with the pandemic. So I think if you put those two things together, the $250 million build last year and what we assumed to be $120 million burn this year, that's about $370 million of headwind when you just do year-over-year compare in growth, and that's -- could be up to six points or something. Again, it's not a concern to build into how we think about the year, but we do want to remind investors on that piece. Now -- and I think throughout the year, we're going to have some strange compares. Remember that we sold $871 million in bamlanivimab in Q4, we expect to have significant sales this year as well. So we'll tease all that as we go through. But on the underlying base business, you should expect to see an inventory negative growth effect in Q1.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Kerry, thanks for your question. And we'll go to Dave now for the close.\nDave Ricks: Great. Thanks, Kevin, and to the team. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's call, and of course, your interest in Eli Lilly. 2020 was a strong year for the Company, and we anticipate an important year in 2021. A lot of questions related to Alzheimer's today. We're excited about that as well. But just a reminder, we have upcoming readouts for tirzepatide with sustained two, three and five over the coming weeks and months as well as a number of readouts this year in our immunology portfolio for baricitinib, lebrikizumab and mirikizumab in important indications. The Company has a broad and diversified set of opportunities ahead for additional innovation for patients. With our strong lineup of marketed products as well and this industry-leading pipeline, we believe we continue to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in. Please follow-up with the IR team, if you have any additional questions and hope everyone has a great day and a great weekend. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Josh. We had an exciting start to 2021 as we read out positive results for gentimab in the Phase 2 Trailblazer Al study. Lilly has spent more than 30 years dedicated to finding solutions for Alzheimer's disease, and we are proud of our progress in advancing the science and providing hope for patients and their families suffering from this devastating disease. On Slide 14, you can see our key takeaways from this exciting trial. We are encouraged by the strong efficacy results, where in a relatively small study, we overcame the scale of the study with precision on patient enrollment and a very potent and effective plaque-clearing drug, becoming the first-ever disease modification study to hit statistical significance on its primary endpoint, with a slowing of decline by 32% relative to placebo as measured by the integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale. ADAS is a clinical composite tool, combining two well-accepted measures in Alzheimer's disease: ADAS-Cog 13 for cognition; and ADCS IADL, Instrumental Activities of Data Living, for function. While the study was not powered for assessing multiple endpoints, we're very encouraged by the consistent improvements observed on all pre-specified secondary endpoints for cognition and function compared to placebo though ganitumab did not reach statistical significance on every secondary endpoint. The consistency across time points and across statistical methods was very encouraging, particularly the disease progression model, which is becoming more accepted by the scientific community. In addition, we saw rapid and deep amyloid plaque clearance for ganitumab-treated patients who, on average, showed an 84 centiloid reduction of amyloid plaque at 76 weeks compared to a baseline of 108 centiloids. Since below 25 centiloids is a negative amyloid scan, this means that the average ganitumab-treated patient had a negative scan by the end of the study. Finally, the safety profile was consistent with observations from Phase 1. Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities or ARIA were observed, which is consistent with plaque-clearing antibodies. In the ganitumab treatment Group, ARIA E occurred in 27% of treated participants with an overall incidence of 6% of patients experiencing symptomatic ARIA E. We look forward to sharing the full results of Trailblazer AS at the ADPD 2021 virtual meeting on March 13, and we plan to have an investor call at 11 a.m. on March 15. We hope to reproduce and extend these exciting findings in our second pivotal donanemab trial, TRAILBLAZER ALS 2, an 18-month study which began enrolling patients last year. At present, the study is expected to complete enrollment later this year with nearly twice as many patients as the first TRAILBLAZER trial. We'll be engaging regulators to finalize the patient numbers and statistical plans for TRAILBLAZER 2, and we hope the exciting results from TRAILBLAZER 1 will increase patient interest and expedite enrollment. TRAILBLAZER 2 was designed last year prior to TRAILBLAZER 1 data. And while the design is similar, at that time, we incorporated a few differences, including CDR sum of the boxes was moved to the primary endpoint for this larger trial, while ADAS becomes a key secondary endpoint. We added a high tau group and we include a blood-based screening for enrollment using the P-tau biomarker. We look forward to sharing the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data and discussing next step for ganitumab with regulators. Moving to Slide 15. As we discussed in-depth on Tuesday's call, there've been a number of developments for our COVID-19 antibodies since our last earnings call, which I will highlight only briefly now. In November, the FDA granted emergency use authorization for bamlanivimab as a treatment for COVID-19. We also submitted a request for EUA for bamlanivimab and antisemab together, which remain under review based on Phase 2 data from the BLAZE 1 trial. Since the EUA for bamlanivimab, we've shipped approximately 1 million doses. We will have over 1 million additional doses available through mid-2021 for use around the world. This week, the U.S. government committed to purchase 500,000 of those additional doses by the end of March. Should any EUA be granted for bamlanivimab and etesevimab together, we expect to be able to supply in collaboration with Amgen up to 1 million doses of antisemab for administration with bamlanivimab together by mid-2021, with 250,000 doses available already in the first quarter this year. In just the past eight days, we've shared Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 2 prevention trial where bamlanivimab showed up to an 80% reduction of risk of COVID-19 for nursing home residents; Phase 3 data from the BLAZE 1 trial for eisemanab together with bamlanivimab, which showed a 70% reduction in hospitalization or death among high-risk COVID-19 patients, providing further support for the EUA request for their joint administration. Importantly, there were no COVID-19-related deaths in the antibody treatment arms from these two pivotal data sets. After having seen these results, Lilly has decided we will no longer conduct placebo-controlled studies in high-risk patients. Initial results from the ongoing BLAZE 4 Phase 2 trial provide viral load and PK/PD data, which demonstrated that lower doses, including bamlanivimab 700 milligrams and tiseramab 1,400 milligrams together, are similar to the 2,800 milligram doses of those antibodies administered together. We expanded the BLAZE 4 trial to also evaluate the administration of bamlanivimab AB with VER-7831 in collaboration with Vier and GSK, reinforcing our commitment to collaborate across the industry to treat current and future strains of COVID-19. And yesterday, we received authorization from the FDA to update preparation and administration instructions in response to feedback from frontline nurses and doctors to enable flexibility, which can reduce infusion times considerably. These updates can shorten infusion times to as little as 16 minutes. We're pleased with the potential impact our neutralizing antibodies can have, and we're working diligently to make them available to patients around the world. While the exciting progress with donanemab and the COVID-19-neutralizing antibodies has dominated Lilly's news in the past few weeks, we have continued to robustly advance the rest of our pipeline. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 27. Positive movement since our last earnings call includes the submissions Dave noted for Jardiance and Verzenio, the submission of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 in Japan, the initiation of a Phase 3 trial for empagliflozin in post-myocardial infarction patients. The movement of two pain assets into Phase 2 and the introduction of eight new Phase 1 assets, including our first clinical assets from two new modalities for Lilly: the siRNA molecule, ANGPTL3 from our collaboration with Dicerna and two gene therapy molecules from Prevail. In fact, we ended 2020 with a total of 17 new Phase 1 starts for the year, surpassing 2019's total of 16 first human doses, which was the highest number of new clinical starts for Lilly in a decade. Considering the significant challenges we faced in 2020, including temporarily stopping the initiation of new clinical studies, this is a remarkable achievement. It speaks to the resilience and determination of our R&D organization during challenging times. Moving to Slide 17. We show a final tally of how we finish 2020 versus the key events that we expected to occur. Since our guidance call in mid-December, we had submissions for selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer in Japan, Jardiance for heart failure for reduced ejection fraction in the United States and Verzenio for early breast cancer in the United States. The sea of blue checkmarks emphasizes the sheer quantity of pipeline advancements in 2020. However, my take away from the year past is that I'm delighted with the quality represented here, including potentially practice-changing data for type 2 diabetes, for hematologic tumors; for early breast cancer, the launch of a first-in-class RET inhibitor; as well as the emergency use authorizations for two medicines to help address the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the significant achievements delivered in 2020. As we transition into 2021, I'd like to note that Josh Bilenker will be leaving his position as CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly to explore other interests and endeavors. We're grateful to Josh for his contributions to human health, both at Loxo and in his time with Lilly. We look forward to working with him in a consulting role. I'm very pleased to announce that Jacob Bernardin is assuming the CEO role, continuing to work alongside Nisha Nanda and David Heyman, ensuring leadership continuity in maintaining the strategy and operating model for Loxo Oncology at Lilly. Jake is a very highly talented leader, and this move allows him to continue to grow his responsibilities for the benefit of Lilly and Loxo. Moving to Slide 18. You can see the expected events for 2021, including the donanemab data and upcoming disclosure I previously mentioned. A number of other major readouts are expected this year, including the remainder of the tirzepatide Phase 3 program, where we are looking forward to building on the SURPASS 1 data we disclosed late last year. The Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's, in a trial similar in design to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several to the TRAILBLAZER trial that just read out; several potential Phase 3 readouts in immunology; and the results of empagliflozin for HFrEF. Based on the recent high-quality pipeline data readouts for ganitumab, tirzepatide and LOXO-305, we entered 2021 optimistic by the impact these assets could have on patients. And we're focused on discovering and developing more new medicines to help patients. Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Thanks, Geoff. Your question is whether we'd consider starting a third donanemab study to improve the safety database. No, we haven't considered that at present. Of course, as we said, our next step is to discuss the dataset we have with regulators. I think if we determine that we need more patience, the place to do that is a TRAILBLAZER-2 study. With respect to additional studies, I think, there could be opportunities to explore other populations and we're working through those possibilities right now, but we don't see that that necessary for this current population. Tim, so your first question is on the possibility of approval from a single study in Alzheimer's disease. Look, we - in general, we don't disclose our back and forth with FDA or other regulators. In this case, of course, we said that next steps are discussions with regulators. So clearly, that hasn't happened yet. Still, we understand the regulatory threshold traditionally has been adequate and well controlled trial that means more than one trial. In this case, we have a single adequate and well controlled trial in Alzheimer's disease. That, as I said, has not been the standard in this area. Of course, in other disease areas, notably in oncology, drugs can be approved from a single trial, usually, that's an accelerated approval. Usually, it's a group that's well defined by pathologic characteristics and biomarkers. Usually, there's dramatic pathologic response as well as clinical outcomes. Of course, that's also true in the case of this donanemab trial, but again, oncology is quite different than Alzheimer's disease. Your second question was on the question of toxic oligomers. It's long been unclear what is the toxic species of a beta, is it monomers? is it oligomers? Is it plaques? This antibody was designed to be exquisitely specific for amyloid plaques. We don't think it binds oligomers. And thereby, the efficacy \u2013 therefore, the efficacy we see here seems to imply that it's the plaques that are the toxic species rather than the like oligomers. However, we can't rule out that these two things are in equilibrium with each other and perhaps by clearing plaques, you remove oligomers as well. Great, thanks. Umer, for your first question on IADRS and its correlation with CDR. Look, when we think about an endpoint for any clinical trial, there's really two things that make an endpoint, a good endpoint. One is the statistical validation behind it. So in other words, is it reliable across different patients across different time points, across different trials, we put together a lot of data that support that. Second, is it meaningful for patients? And in this course - case, of course, we believe that that's inherently true. This is a composite of two things that are widely used, both thought to be important and meaningful ADAS-Cog and activities of daily living, obviously, activities of daily living inherently meaningful for patients. Now, why do we pick IADRS versus CDR to be the primary outcome of the study? That should be obvious, it's because we believe that IADRS would be more sensitive for measuring decline and therefore more sensitive for measuring a drug effect. That's based on all of that statistical validation data that we did. If ADAS and some of the boxes were perfectly well correlated then ADAS couldn't be better, couldn't be more powerful. And yet, I'm telling you that our assumption going into this trial was that it would be. So of course, different outcomes will have some correlation, but they won't be perfectly correlated. Based on what we saw in this trial, I think we haven't changed our thinking on outcomes, and we still think ADAS is a very valid and important outcome for Alzheimer's trials. Of course, that's a discussion to be had with regulators in the scientific community. With the zagotenemab, this is our anti-tau antibody. Just as donanemab was a different type of anti-amyloid beta based on its specificity for plaque, zagotenemab is a different kind of anti-tau antibody. It's highly specific for aggregated tau. Now, we think that's particularly important in the case of tau because there's a lot of soluble monomeric tau, and tau antibodies, like any other antibody, not much of it gets in the brain. So if you have a lot of monomer and a little bit of antibody, it could sop up all of your antibody and not have left to go after what we think is the more important species, aggregated tau. So, we'll have to wait and see. Of course, this is a field that is younger than anti-amyloid therapies, but we've taken a lot of things we learned from anti-amyloid, applied them to anti-tau, and we're quite looking forward to getting that data later this year. Okay. The second question, more straightforward. LOXO-305 is a really uniquely specific reversal BTK inhibitor with great drug properties. That's why it's generating such remarkable data in oncology. You're asking a question that we thought a lot about, which is, could this also translate to being a highly differentiated molecule in immunology? I think in this case, we would not pursue the same molecule. I think this is down the road far enough in oncology. This will be an oncology molecule. But you raised the question of whether we'd be interested in generating a sister molecule, as you said, for immunology indications. That's certainly something we are considering. Okay. Thanks, Dave. Your first question is on the potential for filing, which I think we addressed before. We haven't had those discussions with the regulators. Of course, we move quickly to understand the data and schedule discussions with regulators around the world. As I said before, the regulatory standard is adequate and well-controlled trials, so two trials there. But certainly, we'll be interested to hear what regulators say. Oh, yes, yes. Sorry, Dave. So the second question there is would we change the endpoint. Yes, of course, we can consider it. I think we look at the totality of data that we get from TRAILBLAZER 1, and that will inform our decisions, as well as conversations with regulators. But so far, we haven't seen anything that leads us to make that decision to change it. Got it. Thank you, Chris, for the question about the high-tau population. A notable feature of the TRAILBLAZER trial is that we excluded patients who had too much tau in their brain. We believe that people who have the highest tau or it's spread throughout their brain are past the point of no return at least for an amyloid-directed therapy. Of course, as we fully analyze this data, and hopefully, even in time for the upcoming presentation, we'll understand what we're seeing in this current data set with respect to baseline tau levels predicting response to therapy, as we see that, that could lead us to be either more excited or less excited about including high-tau patients in TRAILBLAZER 2 study. And so that is something that is still very much open. As we see that data and understand it, we could think about changing the design there. In terms of the percent of patients that are impacted here, it sort of depends on how you cut it. If you start with all of the early Alzheimer's patients, plus -- mild AD plus MCI, that's about 4.5 million in the U.S. and double that in Europe and Japan combined. Many of those patients with amyloid negative. We've shown that before. So you take about one-third out for that. A small fraction of them will be amyloid positive but no tau at all. We didn't include those patients. And then a slightly larger fraction will be in that tau high group. So once you've excluded all those patients, we've said it's sort of 30% to 45% of that mild AD to MCI population that would meet these enrollment criteria in TRAILBLAZER 1. Yes. Thank you, Seamus, for those very thoughtful questions focused on that blinding of the study. We said before that TRAILBLAZER 1, we carried this study out with the quality that we typically use for regulatory pivotal studies, fully blinded, double-blinded study. You raised the possibility that there could be some unintentional unblinding as a result of amyloid clearance. We don't see that that's possible. Patients don't know or feel the clearance of amyloid in their brain directly. And investigators wouldn't have seen that the results of the PET scan themselves. The other potential in any Alzheimer's study for in over blinding is ARIA E because sometimes that is something that can cause a side effect. And we commented on the 6% of patients that had symptomatic ARIA E or so. I think that's certainly an important analysis, I think, in every study in Alzheimer's disease is to look at the drug effect with and without ARIA patients. And certainly, that's something that we hope to have complete and be able to share in March. And then finally, you asked about the behavior of the placebo arm. That's a great question. Really, when we saw this data that was the first thing I wanted to look at. Sometimes, you have small studies that look promising. It's because your placebo arm did worse than typical. And here, we said -- we've communicated a high level of confidence and encouragement based on the data. So that excludes that possibility. This placebo arm is not behaving aberrantly. That's not what's driving the effect. Again, we'll get into the details of that in March, but very, very pleased with the performance of the placebo arm here. Andrew, you raised an excellent question on all the work that needs to be done to prepare for ganitumab. We actually initiated manufacturing preparedness before we had this data. So, this is something we do at Lilly. We always prepare for success. And so at the same time, that our manufacturing colleagues we're ramping up the anti-COVID antibodies, we asked them to also prepare for donanemab. So that is well underway, and I like what's going on, the progress we're making in manufacturing there. The diagnostic ecosystem also needs work. We started that both ramping up imaging and proceeding along with opportunities to bring the phospho-TAL blood test to more patients. That's both underway, again, started before we had this data and then, of course, is useful whether we're successful in coming to market or whether any other anti-amyloid drug comes to market. So, those are preparations that we're certainly taking. Yes. Thanks, Ronny. It's a really good question that you're asking, which is how strong is the biomarker evidence here? And how can that be used to support regulatory decisions? I certainly think that's the direction the field is going. So in other words, when I look across all of the trials that have read out, again, this is the first plaque removing antibody that has had a positive study that hit its primary endpoint on the pre-specified statistical analysis. But even the other ones that didn't do that, when you look across the totality of evidence, you get a sense that there's a correlation between plaque removal in general and better cognitive performance. Here, we have probably the most significant plaque removal, the fastest, deepest plaque removal and a very meaningful clinical effect. So it's another point in this sort of dose response curve comparing amyloid plaque removal and cognitive changes across different trials. As that gets filled out further and further by additional experiments, I think amyloid plaque removal could someday become an important surrogate that could aid in the regulatory approval of drugs. Are we there today? I don't know. That's a question for regulators and for the field and something that we certainly have believed in for many years and will continue to take up. Yes. Thanks, Vamil. It's a good point you raise. Of course, the placebo effect getting stronger in second trials is something that's been seen a lot in psychiatry and sometimes in pain studies. As you pointed out, I'm not sure it's such a strong effect in Alzheimer's disease. One thing that encourages us here and I think would allow us to see a strong signal even if there is some of that here, is -- maybe two things that encourage us. First is the magnitude of the effect that we're seeing overall, which, as I said, hits test given in the small trial and TRAILBLAZER 2 is much bigger. Second is the consistency across endpoints and time points and statistical methods. That gives us additional confidence as well. With respect to your second question, which was the tau more for the Alzheimer's program here with AC immune, we decided to pursue other promising tau from our candidates from AC immune's research platform. And therefore, we terminated this Phase 1 molecule. That's probably all we see right now. Great. Carter, two good interesting questions. So on combination of purchase for Alzheimer's, I do think that's what the future holds. One of the really neat things about donanemab is that we just treat until amyloid plaques are removed. This is not a drug that we anticipate patients will be taking for the rest of their lives. Once they're clear of amyloid plaques, we stop treatment with this drug. We know from prior data that plaques don't come back. So you can imagine clearing a patient amyloid plaques and then treating them with another mechanism. That could be complementary, for example, in anti-tau drug or an immunomodulatory drug for Alzheimer's disease. So that's certainly something that we're considering and quite likely will pursue in the future. Thanks for noting momentum in the pain space. This is an area that is just so underserved by the pharmaceutical industry. I think there's a variety of reasons including regulatory thresholds, that have held back investment in an area that represents one of the greatest unmet medical needs. This is why patients -- number one reason why patients see doctors because they're in pain. And we know the drawbacks to current therapies. So we designed a platform pain study, which actually tests -- can test multiple molecules against multiple indications, And we can keep funneling molecules in and get results out. Depending on the strength of the efficacy here, that will inform next steps, but we're confident that this study is well designed to whether we have meaningful treatment effects or not. Of course, a holdback in pain, as I said before, is the regulatory bar, which is heavily weighted towards safety. And typically, that takes a large number of patients to discharge. Certainly, tanezumab, a perfect example of that with so many patients studied and a well-understood signal here on both efficacy and potential safety that needs to be resolved for the FDA. Yes. Thanks, Kerry. We're really excited to have Prevail join Lilly. This is a really great gene therapy platform. Why we picked -- and a great team. Those are clearly two of the reasons why we picked Prevail. Also, I think there's just a natural synergy with the work we do at Lilly. We're extremely strong in neuroscience. We have a deep commitment to the space. And therefore, as we thought about what's our entry point into gene therapy, and we believe gene therapy will be an important treatment modality across therapeutic areas in the future, it made sense to enter gene therapy to begin our efforts here in neuroscience. Prevail has got two exciting programs in the clinic already. One is for Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations, and it's a GBA1 gene transfer. There's a lot of phase validity to that kind of approach, and we're looking forward to seeing data from that. The other similarly well-validated target here in frontotemporal dementia with GRN mutations. And that's also, I think, exciting. In terms of time lines to market, I think it's -- these programs are still very early. We're just in the first few patients here, and we'll have to see what the data showed in port of those time lines."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. On our guidance call in December 2019, we provided a framework for how we are thinking about the 2020 to 2025 period, noting our expectations to continue to deliver top-tier revenue growth and operating margin growing into the mid-to high 30s while continuing to increase R&D productivity. As we met with investors throughout 2020, it was evident that while there was good insight into management's expectations for the next few years, investors were increasingly focused on our ability to grow in the second-half of this coming decade. In the past two months, we have begin \u2013 we have begun to deliver answers to that question, with positive data for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab, each with a chance to significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet medical need. We believe these are three of the most important and exciting pipeline assets in our industry and provide meaningful support for Lilly's growth potential beyond 2025. Together with Verzenio data in early breast cancer last summer, we have significantly reinforced our growth prospects for the midterm and upgraded them for the long-term. While these readouts drive incredible momentum for our future, I am also pleased with the way that we delivered in a complex and challenging 2020. Our 2020 revenue enabled us to exceed our midterm revenue goal of 7% CAGR from the years 2015 to 2020. Turning to the quarter. Revenue grew an impressive 22% versus Q4 2019, or 20% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 24 percentage points despite continued pricing headwinds and demand pressure from the effects of COVID-19. Excluding bamlanivimab, revenue grew over 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continue to drive this volume and our revenue, now representing 55% of our base business. We continue to advance our productivity agenda in Q4 as the combination of strong revenue growth and modest operating expense growth drove significant margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin was approximately 33% with and without COVID-19 therapies, an improvement of roughly 650 basis points versus Q4 2019. With continued margin expansion for the quarter and full-year, excluding the impacts of COVID-19 on our business in 2020, we would have achieved our midterm operating margin as a percent of revenue goal of 31%. We're proud to have delivered nearly 1,000 basis points of operating margin expansion since 2016. In addition to the strong business performance, we achieved multiple pipeline milestones since our Q3 earnings call. These include the positive results I noted for LOXO-305, tirzepatide and donanemab; the FDA granting emergency use authorizations for bamlanivimab and baricitinib to help patients with COVID-19; the submission of empagliflozin for heart failure in people with reduced injection fraction in the U.S., Europe and Japan, this is done in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim; and the submission of Verzenio in early breast cancer in the U.S. During Q4, we put our growing operating cash flow to work, announcing a 5% increase in the dividend for the third consecutive year, as well as continuing to pursue external innovation to augment future growth prospects with the acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. This acquisition adds a promising new modality for Lilly by creating a gene therapy program that will be anchored by Prevail's portfolio of clinical-stage and late-preclinical-stage gene therapies across Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders. Moving to Slides 5 and 6. You'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. In November, we announced that Arti Shaw, our Senior Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer, will retire in the first-half of this year after 27 years of service to Lilly. She's been an invaluable member of our Executive Committee and a leader who really models our values. In addition to leading the development of our digital information strategy, she has developed and mentored talent throughout the organization and demonstrated a deep care for the patients we aim to serve. I want to thank Arti for her many contributions to Lilly. And now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to review our Q4 and full-year results. Well, thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we made in 2020. 2020 was a remarkable year as Lilly worked to fulfill its purpose in new and important ways. In addition to many contributions in the fight against the global pandemic, our business grew 10% in 2020 driven by strong volume growth from our key growth products launched since 2014. These products now account for more than half of our revenue for the first time. We continued our productivity journey, delivering nearly 300 basis points of operating margin expansion for our base business. We made significant progress on our innovation based strategy, with LOXO-305, tirzepatide and Verzenio early breast cancer readouts, delivering potential category-changing data. While January's donanemab top line success was a first in Alzheimer's. With EUAs for bamlanivimab and Olumiant to combat COVID-19 and bolt-on acquisitions of Dermira and Prevail book ending the year, the past 12 months have been an exceptional example of Lilly's success in leveraging internal and external innovation. We returned nearly $3.2 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase, and we will have another meaningful dividend increase, which we announced in December, reflecting significant confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. All of this was accomplished against the headwind of a pandemic that is still raging. While the New Year does not free us from that near-term challenge, our long-term outlook has never been stronger. This concludes the prepared remarks, and I'll turn the call over to Kevin for the Q&A. Probably worth mentioning, Geoff, as well as Durham, because I think that one also, you see some suppression in new patients starts, not affecting our share anything but just the overall volume in the category. Yes. Steve, I mean, we don't comment on analyst models or forecast, and we never would. So I can't directly answer your question. I guess what I can say is, we've invested in Alzheimer's for 30-plus years and spent a lot of money, as you point out, mostly failing, because there's a huge unmet medical need, and we believe that investment is justified based on the size of market. But we're not able to say today, donanemab is the answer, has a path to market, et cetera. We're not saying any of that. We're looking forward to the ADPD presentation coming up. The field will survey that data and make your own conclusions. And we need to talk to the FDA in a formal way about the path forward, and then we'll get to sales forecast later, but it's just not possible to answer a question like the one you asked. Okay. Yes, I'll comment. Dan, jump in. I mean we've -- since the beginning, we've been working with health care systems and physicians across the country to enable uptake of the antibodies. I guess it's, in some ways, a test of what happens when you don't have the normal commercial preparation and rollout. This was done via government channels under an EUA. And you see big differences in adoption rates, and I highlighted that it seems to be an inverse relationship between the places you think about advanced medicine and who's actually using this. One of those barriers clearly is conviction on the data. So, I'm really pleased with the data we announced in the last week, and I think it will, has to, increase conviction. And this is also -- there's a class effect here, too. And the fact that other antibodies are demonstrating promise in different settings adds to that data and I think will build confidence. So hopefully, that will change. There's two endorsements as well we hope will change: one is NIH, the other is the Infectious Disease Society. That said, there's tons of practical problems with at scale, infusing people with COVID-19 that have been completely worked out by numerous health systems and not worked out by many, many others. So we work quite a bit with state departments of health, et cetera, to share those practices. The best practice is chart flagging upon positive COVID-19 for at-risk patients, scheduling of appointments, dedicated facilities and staff for high-throughput antibody administration. Where that's happening, they're using a lot of material. And you can almost see actually a reduction in health care utilization. So we're actually running an experiment like that in New Mexico to actually prove it as well as with UnitedHealthcare. But I'm optimistic that we'll see the rate of use grow. It moved from about 20% in December to about double that now. We hope to see more progress going forward. Great. Thanks, Kevin, and to the team. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's call, and of course, your interest in Eli Lilly. 2020 was a strong year for the Company, and we anticipate an important year in 2021. A lot of questions related to Alzheimer's today. We're excited about that as well. But just a reminder, we have upcoming readouts for tirzepatide with sustained two, three and five over the coming weeks and months as well as a number of readouts this year in our immunology portfolio for baricitinib, lebrikizumab and mirikizumab in important indications. The Company has a broad and diversified set of opportunities ahead for additional innovation for patients. With our strong lineup of marketed products as well and this industry-leading pipeline, we believe we continue to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in. Please follow-up with the IR team, if you have any additional questions and hope everyone has a great day and a great weekend. Take care."

            "name": "Josh Smiley",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good morning. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in Q4 and 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 22% this quarter compared to Q4 2019 and increased 7%, excluding bamlanivimab sales. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 130 basis points to 78.6%. Excluding the impact of bamlanivimab revenue and the related manufacturing costs, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 79.9%, in line with Q4 2019 performance. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 3% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses were down 8% as reduced activity due to COVID-19 and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. R&D expenses increased 16%, driven by investment in COVID-19 therapies. Net of COVID-19 expenses, baseline R&D was relatively flat, and total operating expenses decreased over 5% compared to Q4 2019. Operating income increased 53% compared to Q4 2019 as revenue growth far outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 33% for the quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 therapies, operating income grew 34% in the quarter and the operating margin for our base business was 32.7% for Q4. Other income and expense was income of $477 million this quarter compared to income of $206 million in Q4 2019, driven by investment gains on public equities. As we noted in our Q3 earnings call, beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We have posted a supplemental investor workbook for Q4 on that basis to enable you to have an apples-to-apples comparison as we move into 2021 and compare to 2020 non-GAAP performance. Our tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 180 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by net discrete tax items in both quarters. At the bottom line, net income increased 58%, while earnings per share increased 59%. Net of COVID-19 therapies, net income and earnings per share increased 43%. Moving to Slide 8. You can see these same non-GAAP measures for the full-year. In spite of the ongoing demand impact from the pandemic, we grew the top line at 10% or 6%, excluding bamlanivimab. Excluding COVID-19 therapies, our operating margin expanded by 300 basis points contributing to 30% EPS growth while continuing to invest behind our newer products and pipeline. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 20% in constant currency during Q4, driven by strong volume growth of 24%, partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest impact on revenue growth. U.S. revenue grew 31% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and 7%, excluding bamlanivimab. For the base business, volume growth of 11% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. Pricing was a 5% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter driven primarily by increased rates to maintain excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases, largely for diabetes, and to a lesser extent, by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Taltz, which was driven by the access win at ESI. Segment mix was not a major driver of U.S. price performance in the fourth quarter as increased utilization in more highly rebated government segments was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment primarily for Trulicity and Humalog. Like Q4, the full impact of price was also a headwind of 5%, consistent with our 2020 expectations for a mid-single-digit net price decline in the U.S. While the midterm price trends are stable at present, given the increasing variability in payer mix, we expect to see quarterly variability in our U.S. price impact during the course of 2021. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 12% in constant currency driven by 9% volume growth and a favorable impact from price. Volume growth was led by Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the continued uptake of our key growth products across Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021. In Japan, revenue decreased 10% in constant currency driven primarily by decreased volume in post-patent expiry products, Cialis and Forteo, as well as by a modest pricing headwind due to the government-mandated price decreases that went into effect in March 2020. Japan is experiencing the impact of countercyclical patent expiries with Cialis, Strattera and Cymbalta LOEs impacting growth in 2020 and likely in 2021. In China, revenue grew 31% in constant currency driven by 57% volume growth driven by Tyvyt and partially offset by pricing concessions for the government-sponsored programs, which drove Tyvyt significant volume growth. We are excited about the momentum of our China oncology business, and we are looking forward to continued growth for Tyvyt and the launch uptake for Verzenio. We're also pleased that Trulicity and Olumiant were added to the NRDL as of January 2021. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 6% in constant currency driven by strong volume from Trulicity and Olumiant as well as three percentage points of growth coming from bamlanivimab sales to Canada. The same information for our full year revenue is at the bottom of the slide. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. These newer medicines delivered nearly 14 percentage points of growth this quarter, with bamlanivimab also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth in our key products was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as by reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehring Ingelheim. This impact will sunset as we move into 2021. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.6 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 55% of our base revenue. Amidst the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we are encouraged by the performance of our key growth products in 2020. Trulicity grew 23%, adding nearly $1 billion last year to finish with over $5 billion in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in revenue while outgrowing the GLP-1 injectable class in the U.S. and exiting 2020 with a nearly 47% share of total prescriptions amidst the reacceleration of growth for injectable GLP-1s. Taltz grew 31% to nearly $1.8 billion in revenue, outgrowing the U.S. market in both dermatology and rheumatology and entering 2021 with best-in-class access that provides a strong foundation for long-term growth. Jardiance crossed $1 billion in sales for Lilly's share revenue in 2020, ending the year at nearly 60% of total SGLT2 prescriptions in the U.S. and driving encouraging growth for the class, as we look forward to the regulatory action for FrEF and the readout for HFrEF this year. And Verzenio revenue grew nearly 60% in 2020 to over $900 million, significantly outgrowing the CDK 4/6 class growing six percentage points in total prescriptions while nearly doubling new-to-brand share of market on the heels of positive data readouts for overall survival in metastatic breast cancer in 2019 and early breast cancer in 2020. Our key growth products will continue to drive Lilly's strong growth outlook in 2021. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2020, we invested over $8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after-tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $3.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. As mentioned earlier, we also announced a 15% dividend increase for the third consecutive year, demonstrating our confidence in the outlook for the Company. We are focused on utilizing the strong cash flow our through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics. We will remain active in assessing bolt-on acquisitions or in-licensing, where we can create shareholder value and enhance our future growth prospects. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are affirming our non-GAAP guidance, and we've updated our GAAP guidance to reflect the impact of the Precision Biosciences, Merus and Asahi Kasei agreements, which with reported earnings per share for 2021, now expected to be in the range of $7.10 to $7.75. The impact of the recently completed acquisition of Prevail Therapeutics will be updated on our next quarterly call and will only impact Lilly's GAAP guidance for 2021. There will be no change to our 2021 guidance for R&D expense or non-GAAP EPS as a result of this transaction. As we move into this New Year, and as we noted on our guidance call, we continue to experience suppressed demand due to the pandemic with several key therapeutic classes still below our pre-COVID baseline. We remain committed to ensuring we are doing our part to limit COVID-19 exposure for physicians, patients and our employees as cases surge in the U.S. and around the world. At present, most of our HCP interactions in the U.S. and many other major markets are virtual. While this may have a near-term impact on new-to-brand performance, we continue to believe our approach is the appropriate posture as we support health care professionals navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccination to enable a return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. In addition, our year-end 2020 inventory build was approximately a $120 million higher than Q4 2019, which was driven by 2019 having a lower-than-typical year-end stocking. This primarily impacts our diabetes products as well as Taltz and Alimta. We anticipate this inventory will burn off in Q1 2021 like normal historical patterns. As I noted on our guidance call, we also experienced significant COVID-19-related stocking benefit of roughly $250 million in Q1 2020. Given those divergent year-over-year inventory trends, we expect inventory patterns will have a negative impact on revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the first quarter of 2021. Despite these challenges, we remain confident in our full year outlook for 2021 and have increased confidence in our mid- and long-term outlook given our recent high-quality pipeline readouts. So, now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Thanks, Geoff. I think when we look across our therapeutic areas, it's relatively consistent at this point that we're still not quite back to new to grand prescriptions in key areas, like immunology, pain and diabetes, although the diabetes numbers are looking stronger as we get here into January, but I think we're still seeing some suppressed demand. Physicians have, I think, in most markets has figured out how to see patients safely, and we're seeing nothing like what we saw back in April and May in the U.S. So, I think we just have to be cautious as we get into the first quarter and realize that the more complex treatments have some higher degree of variability against them and that includes starting new patients in areas like migraine. I think maintenance has been good throughout the pandemic. So, we do expect it, as we get through the first-half of this year, we'll see returned to fully normal levels. But I think it's fair to assume that in the first quarter, we'll still be, in many of the therapeutic areas a little bit below pre-COVID baselines in terms of new prescription starts. Chris, on 340B, what we said is if you look over the last 10 years, the 340B segment has been among the fastest-growing, certainly across the industry but for our business as well, and it rivals the size of Medicaid in our U.S. business, so about 10% of the business now. Of course, the change we made was to go back to the legislated intent and to provide the discounts to the actual hospitals that provide care and to exclude contract pharmacy that have grown overtime And when we look at that business, it's probably about half of the businesses in these contracted pharmacy. So that's where we've made the change, to not provide the pricing there. Now, we do have a process where those contracted pharmacy can apply and we've said for insolence, as long as they can demonstrate that they're passing on the entire pricing that they're still eligible to participate. When we look at all that together, we knew that that's where we implemented in September. We knew there would be challenges, and we're seeing those challenges come, but I think in terms of patient impacts, we haven't seen much yet. So, we're seeing the fact that the discounts are being provided as per our change, but we don't think it's impacting patient care at this point. So everything we're seeing so far is consistent with the decision we made. We knew it would be a difficult decision to implement. We knew there would be some customer concerns. We knew there'd be legal challenges, but I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is consistent with the guidance we've given for 2021, which is that we would expect this portion of the 340b program to moderate in growth and provide a two to three point price tailwind for us in 2021. So I think we're on track for that at this point. Yes. Thanks, Greg. So what we've said for this year is guidance range for COVID antibodies is $1 billion to $2 billion. And of course, there's a lot of uncertainty in that. Although with what we've announced this morning on the call, the next agreement that we've signed with the U.S. government, it's probably high probability for $1 billion in the first quarter. That's just the purchase agreements that we already have. I think then to get past that, we have -- based on what we've already committed to in terms of manufacturing, probably about another 500,000 banliminivab doses available in the first half of the year in monotherapy and one million combo. So if we sold all of that and it's weighted heavily towards the U.S. or high-income countries, you could get above $2 billion. But we don't have an EUA with the U.S. government or any other government for the combo yet, and there's a lot to still play out, I think, in terms of vaccine and where these products can be utilized. If we get into the second half of the year, I think we can continue at the pace of production of million-plus doses available per quarter. I don't think the manufacturing piece is going to be as much of a barrier in the second half of the year if we stay on the course of vaccines and otherwise. So clearly, we could be above $2 billion for the year. But there's a lot of uncertainty, and we'll continue to monitor this number and provide updates as we have more agreements and more approvals. Thanks, Ronny. As I mentioned earlier, we've guided to a two- to three-point price benefit in 2021 as a function of the 340B changes that we've made. We've been very clear on 340B that the reason for the change is that we're providing discounts that patients don't get. And we want the program needs to be reformed and cleaned up. So our assumption is in 2021, there will be changes. Whether -- and as I mentioned earlier, we also have mechanisms for contract pharmacies to get the discounts. We want to ensure that patients' insulin can get the pass-through discount. So we're assuming in our 2021 guidance that -- not a full financial benefit for the full year that there will be changes in modifications through the year, either as we try to work to ensure patients get the benefits of the discounts or if there are some administrative or legislative changes. Thanks, Kerry. Yes. On inventory, what we've said is if you look at 2020 inventory in the U.S. inventory levels versus Q4 of 2019, we're $120 million higher. We're not concerned about that. 2019 was an unusually low year when you just look at days of stock. So the $120 million is in line with our expectations. But now as we look into Q1 2021, we do expect that $120 million will burn off. And it's across the portfolio. But as you would imagine, Trulicity is one of the products. We see a little bit extra in Taltz, and I think some of this is a function of the anticipation of increased volume for Taltz as a function of the ESI win that'll go in -- that went into effect on January 1. And we also see some on Alimta. We did see some purchasing patterns through the year in oncology. I think some of which was related to the pandemic and some delays in infused products, but those are probably the two biggest products where we see this on. So we would expect that $120 million to burn off in Q1 as it normally does. The other piece, though, that we want to make investors aware is, remember last year in Q1 we saw a $250 million build in inventory on a worldwide basis. This was as customers were stocking up in anticipation of the walk-downs that were coming with the pandemic. So I think if you put those two things together, the $250 million build last year and what we assumed to be $120 million burn this year, that's about $370 million of headwind when you just do year-over-year compare in growth, and that's -- could be up to six points or something. Again, it's not a concern to build into how we think about the year, but we do want to remind investors on that piece. Now -- and I think throughout the year, we're going to have some strange compares. Remember that we sold $871 million in bamlanivimab in Q4, we expect to have significant sales this year as well. So we'll tease all that as we go through. But on the underlying base business, you should expect to see an inventory negative growth effect in Q1."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Terence, for the question. And we're obviously very excited about the data, both in CLL and CL. And so we do have ongoing discussions with the FDA regarding the potential for accelerated approval. Obviously, in this place, the single-arm accelerated approvals for heme malignancies can be challenging. And so that really require -- was going to require further discussions with regulators. So we can't commit yet on submissions, timing or which indications, but be assured that we'll continue those conversations. And we couldn't be more excited about the data, as Dan mentioned. I think this molecule really started as a molecule focus on C41 mutations, and then as we saw the data and the performance in the broader populations remarkable. So, we'll keep that with conversations going, and we'll keep you posted. Yes. Thanks for the question on Verzenio. So as you noted, 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically 2020 was really another year of very positive and clinically meaningful data for Verzenio. And then our shares, as a result, I think, continue to improve. While obviously, no CDK is yet approved in the EVC setting, we do think that this readout is particularly drew attention to the market class. So that said, we're really confident that the current trends are a result of our strong execution and our focus on NBC and then the -- particularly logistically significant OS data, which a key competitor in the space didn't have. As we compare Q4 '19 to Q4 '20, it was really a remarkable period of growth, as you said, for Verzenio. We saw TRx increase of 6% worldwide revenue growth of 57% and U.S. growth of 36%. And what we're hearing pretty repeatedly now from thought leaders is that they're seeing more and more that Verzenio is a differentiated agent. So obviously, we've shared that in MEMS, we feel we have higher CDK4 activity than -- versus others, differentiated continuous dosing, a monotherapy indication, and then obviously, the data that we saw in MONARCH 2 with the primary endocrine-resistant population. So I think all of that is really playing into the growth that we're seeing in the MVC market. And so, we'll expect to continue to see our growth -- our share market grow in that space. On the adjuvant side, as Dave and others mentioned, we did submit to the FDA in other areas at the end of last year. So we look forward to regulatory action later this year. This market size is significant in the fact that it's probably an additional 50% if you match our entry criteria, 50% increase to our current metastatic market in this high-risk adjuvant population. So that's significant. And what's also significant is the duration of treatment will very likely will be longer than a metastatic setting. So patients in the study are treated for 24 months. And right now, we're seeing patients stay on for months on average in the study. And many of the patients are still on study, so I think that number will continue to get longer. So that duration of treatment offers upside as well. But we're incredibly excited about the data. We're looking forward to bringing it to patients as soon as possible. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question on 305. So with the MSL population, it's important to remember, this arm of our company talks about the work that's going on in our -- across our portfolio. So this is not just related to 305, but we have other assets in the portfolio that may be heading in this space. So I wouldn't read too much into that, its normal operations to make sure that we're covering the portfolio. But obviously, they do get many questions about 305, the excitement that's out there in treating physicians. And importantly, we have a number of large Phase 3 trials that are starting as well. And as you know, that field force helps us identify high-quality rates to include in those programs. As far as CLL, obviously, the story there is incredibly exciting, and we do think that we have a real contender here. Particularly what we're interested in seeing is what has been seen in the past, certainly in the area of oncology, is that drugs that have a meaningful treatment effect on the same target pathway in patients who have relapsed tend to have sometimes an even more pronounced effect in that first-line setting. And so that's the upside here that is the potential for LOXO-305 is that first-line setting. So this year, we're actually planning to initiate, as you know, four global clinical studies, and three of them are in CLL. And obviously, two of them are in the BTK-pretreated patients, but one is in that really in a head-to-head setting and looking at head-to-head with ibrutinib in CLL. And obviously, this is a riskier study to do. We still feel very confident in the later-line setting, but we do have a belief that this molecule has a lot of potential in the first line, but hence, doing the trials. So obviously, as I said earlier, I can't comment on the regulatory likelihood. Those are ongoing conversations with the FDA. But regardless, we know that in this space, you need randomized clinical trials to really reach the patients that we wish to reach. And so that's -- the intention is to do those trials regardless."

Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly USA; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. We're also joined by Sara Smith and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those noted on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in Lilly's latest form 10-K and subsequent forms 10-Q and 8-Ks. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It was not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. Q3 was another important quarter for Lilly and the pharmaceutical industry's progress in developing new medicines to treat COVID-19. I'm very proud of Lilly's work and we'll go into detail of the promising advancements made this quarter. However, I'd like to start by summarizing our overall business performance. Clearly, this quarter's financial results came in below sell side analyst projections. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I'll make a few high level comments on several factors that did impact our Q3 results. And then Josh will go into more detail later. First, as we've discussed in the past, the impact of price on revenue can be volatile in the U.S., as we make estimates for rebates and discounts, obligations during the coverage gap of Medicare Part D patient assistance programs and other liabilities. During Q3, the magnitude of adjustments was meaningful, predominantly related to our assumptions regarding our obligation during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D for Trulicity. While the impact was notable in Q3, this source of volatility normalizes when analyzing our results over the first nine months, as well as for the full year. In addition, while we are encouraged new prescriptions are trending toward pre-COVID levels, the recovery varies by class. We view this important -- this impact is transient, remain confident in the underlying business and continue to manage our operations to deliver success over the long-term. From an operating expense standpoint, we made significant investments in R&D to develop COVID-19 treatments. While we spoken before about our efforts to develop COVID-19 treatments, we've not quantified that investment level. In Q3, we were fortunate to see positive clinical data from multiple trials. And this activity had an impact of about $0.12 on Q3 earnings per share. Finally, after taking a pause on active promotion in Q2 to respect the impact that COVID-19 had on medical practices, we increased our investments in customer facing activity and direct-to-consumer marketing in Q3 in order to accelerate our growth. While this did create a step-up compared to our investment level in SG&A in Q2 2020 and versus Q3 2019, we believe our progress in Q3 sets us up for a strong finish to the year and to provide meaningful momentum into 2021. We have a number of opportunities to drive this growth through these investments in our existing commercial portfolio. These include our unique CD indication for Trulicity and the recently launched higher doses. Pulling through access wins for [Togs] and launching the recently approved non-radiographic axSpA indication and driving increased uptake of Verzenio through our differentiated data package, just to highlight a few. Looking at the underlying trends, in Q3, we delivered revenue growth of 5% or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Despite disruptions on new patients\u2019 charts from the global pandemic, volume growth was solid, increasing by 9% versus Q3 2019. Our key growth products continue to be the catalyst for our business performance and made up over half of our revenue during the quarter. International performance in Europe and China was particularly strong, as constant currency revenue grew 9% and 10% respectively, driven by our newest products. For the first nine months of the year, our revenue grew by 6%, driven by 12% volume growth. This growth was delivered during a period of significant disruption. The ways we launch new medicines, execute clinical trials and manufacturer our products, have all been meaningfully changed during the pandemic, with some adjustments likely to remain as our business continues to evolve. We are proud of our efforts to ensure patients have access to medicines by maintaining our manufacturing plans in continuous operation and by developing potential new treatments for COVID-19. Operating margin as a percent of revenue was 26.2% for the third quarter. This is a decline of 230 basis points versus Q3 2019 but was depressed by $125 million that we invested in COVID-19 therapies during the quarter. Excluding these exceptional activities, operating margin was 28.4%. We have confidence in our outlook and expect to deliver financial results within our updated guidance range, with all lines at or above our original 2020 guidance, and to achieve our operating margin expansion plans, excluding our investments in COVID-19 treatments. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain well-positioned for a period of sustained growth and margin expansion. Turning to the pipeline. In Q3, we made meaningful progress advancing our late-stage pipeline and developing potential COVID-19 treatments, including FDA approval of additional doses for Trulicity for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, an important data readout for Verzenio in early breast cancer, approval in Europe for Olumiant in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results from the ACTT-2 trial baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, positive results of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibody monotherapy in combination therapy. And we presented new data on a potential new indication for Jardiance in collaboration with Behringer Ingelheim. I'm encouraged by our company's efforts to develop potential new therapies to treat COVID-19 and working at unprecedented speed. This work would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of many employees of Lilly and the collaborative efforts across the industry, regulators and government. We continue to utilize external innovation and collaborations to augment our internal capabilities. This quarter we signed a number of business development transactions, including the global expansion of our TYVYT collaboration with Innovent. At the same time, we utilized our strong cash flow to return nearly $700 million to shareholders via the dividend. Moving to Slide 5 and 6, you'll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. I would like to welcome Ilya Yuffa to our executive team as he assumes leadership for our Bio-Medicines business unit, a 25 year veteran with a tremendous breadth of experience across our organization from finance, business development and sales to Six Sigma, ethics and compliance and general management. Ilya has consistently delivered impressive results in successful larger roles -- that successively larger roles, which are prepared him well to lead Lilly Bio-Medicines. After serving as General Manager of Italy since 2018, Ilya has been leading Lilly's largest franchise U.S. Diabetes, where he played a critical role in the continued success of the market leading medicine Trulicity as well as Jardiance in the two fastest growing classes in diabetes. Ilya it\u2019s great to have you on our leadership team. I'd also like to thank Patrik for his energy, focus and execution that he brought to his time as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. Given Patrik\u2019s strong record of successfully managing Lilly businesses in complex markets around the world, he is the right enterprise leader to lead Lilly USA and our global customer focused functions during this exciting period of opportunity and growth, as we look to continue to deliver new medicines to patients. Before I turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020, I want to discuss briefly certain events at one of our manufacturing facilities located in Branchburg, New Jersey. Late last year, our Branchburg plant underwent a routine FDA general surveillance inspection. The inspectors identified findings related to data handling and we received an official action indicated notice, as well as a follow up inspection this year. We have not received a warning letter or other enforcement letter from the FDA at this time. Given that this plant is among several worldwide that produces bamlanivimab or Lilly SARS-CoV-555, one of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, I want to share more information about our response to these inspections. First, we are confident the issues raised during the inspections did not impact product quality or patient safety for bamlanivimab or for any other product manufactured at the Branchburg plant. Having said that, we and I take remediation of these data handling issues and our commitment to quality and safety very seriously. We engaged an external firm to conduct a comprehensive independent review of systems at the Branchburg site, and we were working diligently to incorporate suggestions for improvement to our procedures. We have also had this firm perform independent reviews of our manufacturing of bamlanivimab at Branchburg to examine our manufacturing batch records and quality documentation to corroborate our own batch release decisions as we submit for supply of bamlanivimab from Branchburg for the emergency use authorization we requested. We are confident in the material at this facility and frankly at all of our sites. Finally for our neutralizing antibodies, we have a robust global supply chain in place with five active ingredient manufacturing sites worldwide in addition to five additional drug product sites worldwide. Branchburg is one of the active ingredients sites. Once we are approved to do so, our resilient global network is well positioned to begin the supply as we help battle this global pandemic. Now, let me turn it over to Josh.\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7 and 8, you will see our non-GAAP financial performance in Q3 and during the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 5% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as key growth products drove volume growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 79.1%, a decline of 50 basis points versus Q3 2019, driven primarily by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold and lower realized prices, partially offset by favorable manufacturing efficiencies and product mix. Moving down the P&L. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as we invested meaningfully in direct to consumer marketing to augment our virtual tactics, increasing promotion to physicians and consumers in connection with increases in healthcare utilization around the world. As I'll discuss in our guidance in a few minutes, we see the absolute level of third quarter SG&A expenses as indicative of our fourth quarter expenditures as well, which keeps us on track for our full year ranges and modest full year growth. Research and development expenses increased by 6% in the quarter, driven primarily by our efforts to develop COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies and baricitinib for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, partially offset by lower development expenses for late stage assets. In total, operating income decreased 4% compared to Q3 2019 as increased investments, including COVID-19 related R&D expenses, exceeded revenue growth during the quarter. We expect the increased marketing activity and customer activation to drive additional revenue growth going forward. During the first nine months of 2020, operating income increased by 7% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 26.2% during the third quarter and 28.1% for the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned earlier, our investments in COVID-19 therapies represented investment outside of our normal business operations. So excluding R&D expenses of $180 million associated with these important programs, our operating margin during the first nine months of 2020 would have been 29.2% and consistent with our guidance, we expect continued improvement in Q4. We continue to allocate resources efficiently in an environment where COVID-19 is likely to have an impact for a sustained period of time. We've made the transition to a hybrid virtual and in person commercial model to support executing our strategy and we're committed to margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. Other income and expense was income of $159 million this quarter compared to expense of $25 million in Q3 2019. This quarter's other income was primarily driven by investment gains across our portfolio of public and private biopharma company investments as part of our external innovation strategy. As we regularly your highlight, this line can be volatile as public and private equity valuations fluctuate. We've received quite a bit of investor feedback on this item. So beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We believe this will better align our non-GAAP results with our core business operations, allow for easier comparisons with our peer group and remove unpredictable volatility. This quarter, our tax rate was 15.5%, an increase of 380 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and lower net discrete tax benefits this quarter versus the same quarter last year. While we expect some quarterly variability, we remain comfortable with long-term expectations of roughly 14% to 15% tax rate under the current US corporate tax structure. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 4%. During the first nine months of 2020, earnings per share increased 20%. On Slide 9 and 10, we describe the effect of price, rates and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue increased 5% during Q3 as volume growth of 9% was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange rates had 1% positive impact on revenue growth. During the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew 6%, driven by volume growth of 12%. Price was a 6% drag on worldwide growth or 4% if you exclude the impact of Alimta and Tyvyt in China. U.S. revenue grew 3% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 7% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo and the impact on Tradjenta from the restructuring of the BI alliance. In line with our expectations, price was a 4% drag on US revenue growth. 3% points were due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Trulicity. 1% point was due to the net impact of increased rebates across the portfolio to maintain our strong commercial access, partially offset by modest list price increases. While typically we do not discuss detailed pricing dynamics for individual products, I will provide some additional commentary on the impact of price on Trulicity performance in Q3. In prior quarters, we assumed our Part D coverage gap liability would shift to later in the year due to short-term deferral of healthcare utilization caused by the impact of COVID-19 and the increased threshold for entry into the coverage gap. However informed by recent invoices from our Part D customers, we now anticipate similar patterns to prior years. So this resulted in updated estimates that led to a meaningful impact on Q3 results and a double digit drag on Trulicity\u2019s growth rate. Our estimated coverage gap impact for the full year though is largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of the one-time adjustments, Trulicity\u2019s price declined by high single digits in the third quarter versus Q3 2019 and low double digits for the first nine months of 2020. We expect a high single digit price decline for Trulicity for the full year. Last year, we guided toward a mid-single digit price decline for Trulicity. We expected this to be driven by increasing rebates rates to maintain our excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases and modest growth in more highly rebated segments. As 2020 has unfolded, the negative impact of price on Trulicity growth has been higher than we expected, primarily due to segment mix. On Slide 10, we show the impact of segment next and rate on Trulicity growth in 2019 and 2020. While rate was a pricing headwinds, the net impact of modest list price increases and increased rebate rates has been mid-single digits or lower, which is consistent with our expectations. Moving to segment mix. While the commercial segment continues to deliver robust growth, lower net price segments have grown significantly faster. This depressed Trulicity\u2019s reported growth by approximately 7 percentage points in 2019 and 6% percentage points through the first nine months of 2020. This continued growth in 2020 exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by Medicaid and to a lesser extent Medicare in other segments. Within Medicaid, we experienced formulary changes in key states, faster than anticipated pull through of access wins and expansion of total Medicaid lives this year. Trulicity currently has 45% share of market across all segments and continues to be the market leading GLP-1. We exited in Q3 with a similar share of market in the commercial sector segment. However, consistent with volume growth, we gained 4.5 percentage points of share in Medicaid in other segments since Q1 2019 and finished the quarter at a 38% share of market. It's worth noting that utilization of GLP-1 as a class is still immature and low market penetration suggests significant opportunity for additional growth across all segments. GLP-1s are used less in Medicaid and Medicare, and we expect disproportionate volume growth in these segments to continue. Although, these volume gains have a lower realized price than our commercial business, they do represent profitable business and are able Trulicity help more people living with diabetes. So as we project into 2021, we expect continued strong Trulicity access and performance across all segments with modest unit price declines and continued faster growth in lower price segments, to result in high single-digit total net price declines in 2021. However, I would note that this faster segment growth, which contributes to the net price decline, also shows up as higher overall prescription growth for GLP-1s as well. Our outlook for total US pricing trends remains unchanged and we continue to expect mid single-digit price declines for the full year in 2020, as well as moving into 2021. This mid single-digit price decline outlook includes, as we noted last quarter, a modest impact in 2020 from the affected increased US unemployment on segment mix, as well as approximately $100 million to $200 million of impact in 2021. Okay. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 9% in constant currency and volume grew by 10%, partially offset by price. Volume growth is positively impacted by Alimta in Germany due to our patent appeal victory and a court ordered injunction against generics that had entered the market, as well as Trulicity, Taltz, Olumiant and Verzenio. In Japan, revenue grew 1% in constant currency ad 5% volume growth was partially offset by government mandated price decreases that were effective March 2020. Japan revenue benefited from a one-time sale of Cialis, as well as good volume growth from Verzenio and Trulicity, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency, driven by 51% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. These programs help drive China\u2019s significant volume growth, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medicines. We're excited about the momentum of our China oncology business and look forward to receiving regulatory action on Verzenio in the coming months. Outside of our oncology portfolio in China, recently launched products Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance and Olumiant, continue to have strong uptick. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth products, strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance and Olumiant was partially offset by decreased Humalog, Forteo, Cialis and Humulin volume. As shown on Slide 11, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 13 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The strong volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE product for Forteo, as well as reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim announced last year. We end the first nine months of 2020 pleased that our key growth products have contributed approximately 15% year-to-date volume growth. Slide 12 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 52% of revenue. Though our key products are well-positioned to drive strong performance over the long term, we continue to see an impact from reduced patient starts due to COVID-19. In Q3, we were encouraged to see new patient starts recover off the troughs experienced in Q2 as the health system reopened around the world. While different classes have recorded different rates, most classes remain 10% to 20% below pre-COVID baselines. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first nine months of 2020, we invested nearly $6 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D, including the addition of lebrikizumab in a number of early stage agreements. In addition, we returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend. We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt market at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long-term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets. And we do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel or market uncertainty to affect our efforts. Moving to Slide 14, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance and this is based on our best estimates at this time. Key assumptions supporting the guidance, include: Healthcare activity will continue the positive trends seen in Q3, returning to historical levels as doctors utilize telehealth or in-person visits despite additional COVID-19 outbreaks; New patient prescriptions will continue to improve in the US; Pricing headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability program and changes in segment mix due to increased US unemployment will continue to be modest; and, promotional spend will constitute a mix of in person customer interactions, direct-to-consumer advertising, and investments in digital promotion. While uncertainty remains regarding resurgent waves of COVID-19 and any resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we do believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that most patients will find ways to access healthcare. So based on these assumptions, we're maintaining our current full-year revenue range. At the low end of the range, year-over-year sales growth in Q4 would be 8% to 9%, which while a step up from our third quarter growth rate, is supported by current volume trends and our expectations of more limited price impacts in the U.S. Achieving the higher end of the range likely requires some moderate sales from our COVID antibody, which we believe is possible but of course not certain at this point. Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin as a percent of revenue is unchanged on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are narrowing our range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses to $6 billion to $6.1 billion. We are narrowing our range for research and development expenses to $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, with investment in COVID-19 treatments of approximately $400 million for the full year likely to push us to the high end of our range as Lilly continue to self fund these programs. We believe these investments are critical to help combat the global pandemic. We're noting that our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% excludes our substantial investments in COVID-19 treatment and any associated revenue with them. Inclusive of these costs, we expect an operating margin of approximately 29%. While these investments put near-term pressure on our operating margin, they continue to be the right decision for our company and for society. In post launch, we do expect these therapies to be accretive to our operating income. We're updating the range of other income and expense to $450 million to $600 million of income, reflecting additional gains in our equity portfolio seen in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, this number is subject to volatility of the capital markets. Turning to taxes. We're maintaining our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance at approximately 14%. Earnings per share are unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. As I noted with the revenue range, our EPS totals in Q4 will be highly dependent on COVID sales, which is why we're maintaining a pretty broad $0.20 range as we head into the fourth quarter. We exit Q3 well positioned to continue delivering revenue growth and productivity, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the investments we were making to help combat COVID-19 and are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to overcome challenges. Based on our current outlook for Q4, we believe we'll exit the year with strong underlying momentum for 2021. So I'll now turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q3 and an overall pipeline update.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Josh. Since our last call, we've made meaningful progress developing potential treatments for COVID-19, advancing key assets in our pipeline and presenting practice changing clinical trial data at major medical meetings. I\u2019ll begin with updates to our COVID-19 viral neutralizing antibody program. Then I'll provide an update on the full pipeline. And I'll finish by highlighting key events since the last quarter. Moving to Slide 15, Lilly is testing single antibody therapy, as well as combinations of antibodies in several trials across two different patient populations; first, is the treatment of recently diagnosed ambulatory patients; and second, in the prophylactic or preventative setting amongst nursing home residents and staff; a third, more severely ill population, i. e. hospitalized patients, has been studied in the ACTIV-3 trial only. This clinical trial is being run by the NIH and is the only study evaluating the efficacy of bamlanivimab, also known as LY-CoV555 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Based on an updated data set from the trial reviewed yesterday by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, no additional COVID-19 patients in this hospitalized setting will receive bamlanivimab. The board\u2019s recommendation was based on trial data suggesting that the addition of bamlanivimab to remdesivir and other treatments used in the hospitalized setting is unlikely to further help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover from this advanced stage of the disease. In this updated data set, differences in safety outcomes between the bamlanivimab and placebo groups were not significant. Importantly, all other studies of bamlanivimab remain ongoing, including ACTIV-2, the NIH sponsored study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. BLAZE-1, Lylly\u2019s ongoing Phase 2 trial in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting, which is studying bamlanivimab as monotherapy and in combination with etesevimab, also known as LY-CoV016. And BLAZE-2, Lylly\u2019s Phase 2 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff in long-term care facilities. While there was insufficient evidence from ACTIV-3, the bamlanivimab improved clinical outcomes when added to other treatments in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We remain confident based on data from released BLAZE-1 study that bamlanivimab monotherapy may prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of COVID-19. While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don't expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis or in early treatment. And we think the patients, physicians and staff participating in all clinical trials of our neutralizing antibodies, including ACTIV-3. Regarding the Lilly sponsored COVID-19 neutralizing antibody program, we made key advances in the third quarter, which include: We initiated BLAZE-2, the Phase 3 trials studying post exposure prophylaxis for residents and staff in nursing homes; We reported proof of concept data for bamlanivimab monotherapy in BLAZE-1, demonstrating a reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting; We reported that the combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab met the primary and secondary endpoints at an interim analysis of BLAZE-1, significantly reducing viral load and symptoms, as well as meaningfully reducing hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting. And we submitted a request for emergency use authorization to the FDA for bamlanivimab monotherapy in higher risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19. We were particularly encouraged to show that neutralizing antibodies can help people clear virus more quickly improve symptoms and most importantly, prevent serious medical outcomes, like hospitalizations and ER visits. Notably, the pooled data of monotherapy and combination therapy showed a reduction of hospitalizations and ER visits of greater than 75% across all patients. In addition, the monotherapy and combination therapy had an even larger effect size in high risk patients, defined by body mass index ratio. We've now dosed approximately 1,000 trial participants with bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, and we've shared safety and tolerability data from more than 400 patients in the monotherapy and combination therapy arms of BLAZE-1 on our call earlier this month, where we noted that monotherapy and combination therapy were both generally well tolerated with no significant safety concerns. No clinically meaningful differences and treatment emergent adverse events were observed across the treatment groups and the majority of treatment emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. And there have been no drug related serious adverse events reported thus far. We continue to recruit patients in BLAZE-1. While the FDA is still reviewing our request for EUA for monotherapy, we will soon be ready to request emergency use authorization for combination therapy and we intend to submit that request to the FDA as early as November. Another achievement this quarter as part of our efforts to develop potential treatments for COVID-19 was the positive outcome of baricitinib in the NIH sponsored ACT-2 trial of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Baricitinib in combination with remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes. The numerical decrease in mortality compared to remdesivir alone was also demonstrated. These results were most pronounced in patients receiving oxygen. Based on these data, we submitted a request for emergency use authorization for baricitinib to the FDA, and global regulatory discussions are ongoing. With two submissions to the FDA this month for request for emergency use authorizations and with our neutralizing antibody combination therapy providing the potential for a third in November, I'm particularly proud of the progress we've made over such a short period of time to rapidly develop potential new solutions to aid physicians and patients in the battle against this pandemic. Moving to Slide 16, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of October 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes approval for Trulicity alternative dose, approval for baricitinib in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, the previously mentioned initiation of the BLAZE-2 Phase 3 trial, the advancement of two immunology programs into Phase 2, the initiation of two Phase 1 programs and the termination of a Phase 1 diabetes asset and termination of our Ang2 antibodies Phase 2 proof of concept study in COVID-19 due to futility. We also saw results from the Phase 2 trial of Mevidalen, our D1-positive allosteric modulator in patients with lewy body disease. While we were disappointed that the study did not meet its primary cognitive end point at week 12, Mevidalen did show encouraging motor and non-motor benefits, and we are evaluating the next steps for this program at this time. In addition, Pfizer and Lilly have been informed by the USFDA that the agency intends to hold an Advisory Committee Meeting, likely in the March 2021 timeframe to discuss the tanezumab application. As a result, the FDA's review will obviously extend beyond the current December 2020 PDUFA date. However, the FDA has not provided a new action date. The agency communicated that its review of the application is ongoing and has not requested any new clinical studies to be completed at this time. Pfizer and Lilly will continue to work with the FDA as it completes its review of the application. Moving to Slide 17, we provide an update on our 2020 key events. The first nine months of 2020 have been incredibly productive, as highlighted by a significant number of positive key milestones with only a few exceptions. We've delivered on the key events that we outlined back in December 2019 and we've added several more. Most notably since the last earnings call, we've had regulatory approvals for important new indications and line extensions for Trulicity, Taltz and Olumiant. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we also presented results from EMPEROR-Reduced trial in patients with heart failure with reduce ejection fraction or HFREF. Jardiance demonstrated 25% reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. In addition, Jardiance had a positive effect in key secondary end points, including first hospitalization for heart failure and an exploratory renal composite end point. EMPEROR-Reduced included patients with and without diabetes. And these data are encouraging to expand the use of Jardiance in patients with HFREF. They also add to the existing body of evidence showing that cardiovascular and renal benefits of Jardiance, as first demonstrated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We're on track to submit these data to regulators later this year and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trial in HFpEF in 2021. We also presented important data for Verzenio in early breast cancer at the virtual ESMO meeting this quarter, confirming that Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a benefit in this population and the first advancement for these patients in almost two decades. Verzenio showed 25% reduction in risk of cancer recurrence at two year landmark analysis. Verzenio also reduced the risk of distant metastases by 28%, an essential objective for any novel therapy in HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer, as distant recurrence is currently an incurable event. This is an important observation that bodes well for overall survival, since according to published literature, improvements in distant relapse-free survival have been shown to be a leading indicator for improved overall survival. The monarchE study is ongoing. Study participants will remain on trial and continue to be followed, and additional results will be presented in the future. As we stated previously, we intend to submit for regulatory review by the end of the year. We anticipate a standard review time line with the FDA. While there have been many positive pipeline events already this year, we still have two important readouts to come yet this year and a number of updates that will occur during the first half of 2021. Before year end, we'll present additional data from the Phase 1/2 BRUIN study for LOXO-305, our BTK inhibitor. We'll also have top line results from SURPASS 1, the first Phase 3 trial to readout from the tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes program. SURPASS 1 is a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial. We look forward to sharing these data in the coming months for this important program that we believe will raise the bar for treatment expectations for patients with Type 2 diabetes. We have a lot of momentum in R&D at Lilly, which will carry into 2021 where we have a number of additional data readouts, including the remainder of the registrational Phase 3 tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes trials; Phase 3 data for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis; Phase 3 data from lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; Phase 3 Jardiance HFPEF data; Phase 2 data from two Alzheimer's trials, including an important readout from our plaque-clearing antibody, denenab, expected early in Q1 2021. We remain excited about the potential of this molecule to make a real difference for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we look forward to multiple potential proof-of-concept studies from our early-stage portfolios in immunology, neuroscience, diabetes and oncology. We've risen to the challenge this year as we engaged in the fight against COVID-19. We showed our adaptability and commitment to developing medicines through innovative ways. I'm inspired by the indefatigable effort by our teams in their pursuit of new medicines for patients. Dave, back to you for some closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Dan. 2020 has been a difficult yet remarkable year. Despite challenges and the resulting choppiness of our quarterly results, we've delivered volume-driven growth of 6% through the first three quarters of this year. Excluding investments in COVID-19 therapies, we've expanded our operating margin by 160 basis points compared to the first three quarters of 2019. We've made meaningful progress this year on our innovation-based strategy, launching three new medicines and a number of NILEX, delivering important data readouts for key pipeline molecules and developing and submitting EUAs for potential treatment for virus unknown to the world at this time last year. And over the next few months, we have several highly anticipated pipeline readouts on deck. We continue to look for opportunities to augment the future growth of our company through business development and then return excess capital to shareholders. While the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to challenge us, the growth products in our commercial portfolio, limited patent expiry in the next five years and margin expansion opportunities before us, as well as upcoming data readouts in the pipeline, I like our prospects. And I thank my Lilly teammates for persevering and performing amidst the year of challenges to continue to deliver meaningful innovation for the patients we serve. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So my first question for you is, why didn't you lower or tighten your 2020 guidance and leave the antibody sales as upside? Are you having a high degree of conviction behind this Emergency Use Authorization, or are you seeing some positive trends shape up for the fourth quarter? And then my follow-up question is, what are your thoughts on the upcoming FDA AdCom meeting to review BIBS aducanumab? Do you think this will close the door on Alzheimer's drug development or herald a new beginning? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Josh for the first question on guidance and then Dan to the question on the FDA Adcom.\nJosh Smiley: Yes, I think as we look at sales guidance and the implied Q4 absolute numbers we see the trends. Now, we're at the end of October. I think we feel good about the lower end of the range for sure, based on just commercial performance of our products around the world. We have submitted an EUA. Dan talked about the data behind that. So I think it's reasonable to include a potential upside associated with some sales of that antibody to governments around the world in Q4. Of course, it is uncertain. That is why we've kept the range.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks Louise for the question on the AdCom. Of course, like everyone else, we'll be watching it with a great interest. But I don't think I can handicap it one way or the other. The way I see it, the important observation here is around the evidence that lowering plaques can lead to cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's disease. I think we've seen it across a couple of data presentations now. And that's what gives us confidence in our own donanemab, our N3pG antibody that's currently in Phase 2. Just as a reminder, this is a pretty large Phase 2. We've designed it with special care, enrolling a very homogenous group of patients so that it could be powered to show us an efficacy signal, if present. And we look forward to seeing that data early next year.\nOperator: The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTim Anderson: I have a question on tirzepatide, important event your first readout of Phase 3. Can you characterize your level of confidence that the Phase 3 results will wow investors kind of like the Phase II results did? It's notable that analysts already carry $5 billion number for this, which is a high number. And I'm wondering if you can talk about both efficacy and tolerability and safety relative to Phase 2 in terms of what you expect. I know that's asking you to predict how these readouts go, but it's what we have to do as investors. So it'd be great to get your best guess on that. And related to that question, how much data can we realistically expect that you'll provide in the top line press release?\nMike Mason: We've never been more excited about our tirzepatide program. In our Phase 2 Type 2 diabetes studies, 43% of people on tirzepatide had reached a final A1c of 5.7%, which is normal A1c versus only 2% for the market leader, Trulicity. 34% of people on tirzepatide lost more than 15% of their body weight versus 2% for Trulicity. And tirzepatide will be delivered in the same patient-friendly device of Trulicity. Tirzepatide has the opportunity to become a foundational treatment for someone living with Type 2 diabetes that not only need A1c control but could benefit from significant weight loss, which brings additional metabolic health benefits. Further, we're very excited about what tirzepatide can do in obesity and NASH. As you take a look at the results from SURPASS 1, later this year we'll get the results. We'll issue a press release that will likely be top line results. We won't have full data, be able to do a full analysis that will come later at medical meetings in 2021.\nOperator: Thank you, and that will come from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: I have one for Dan and one for Dave, if I may. Perhaps, maybe starting with you, Dave. On the Alzheimer's A4 trial, you've previously expressed openness to possibly taking an interim analysis. I know you have two years plus a follow-up by now already, maybe three years of follow-up by next year. Is that something you're still open to? Just wanted to hear your thoughts. And then, Dan, there's a little bit of confusion on tirzepatide, perhaps in part because both the clin trials, as well as the Lilly slide suggest the trial had a primary completion in October. But when I map out when the last patient entered, which was first week of February and add in the 40 weeks, which is a primary end point, it doesn't look like the trials met the primary end point yet in all the patients. And it will probably be in November and then some time to announce this. So can you confirm if I'm off track there? Thank you very much.\nDan Skovronsky: Of course, A4 is an ongoing trial in patients who are presymptomatic. They don't even have the symptoms Alzheimer's disease but they have amyloid plaques as detected by imaging. And we're testing solanezumab and now a higher dose of solanezumab can have a benefit in those patients. We haven't commented on whether or not there could be opportunities for an interim look here. And right now, we're just focused on the final analysis in that trial. With respect to the timing of the tirzepatide trial and the details on clinicaltrials.gov, I can just reconfirm what we said earlier on the call, which is that we expect to have that data and top line in coming months. It's obviously a major event for us. And you can assume that when we get that data, we're going to turn it around quite quickly.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Greg Gilbert from Truist. Please go ahead.\nGreg Gilbert: I'm going to start with another one on Alzheimer's. Dan, I'm not sure to what degree you can comment on this, but I'm curious how interrelated your studies are and the agency's view of aducanumab. Maybe asked another way. Do you think the agency can act on their application without seeing your data, which is coming pretty soon? It seems to me that what you're bringing to the table is pretty important in the field. And then secondly, I know it's a little early. I was hoping you could talk to your growing confidence in the IL-2 approach since you signed that collaboration a few years ago. It looks like there's some additional data coming at ACR as well. Thanks.\nDan Skovronsky: I think on Alzheimer's disease, your question is how will the FDA think about sort of a class effect here for multiple plaque lowering antibodies show the same result or if they show different results. I don't know. I mean I can't speculate on agency actions. But I can say that it wouldn't surprise me if regulators around the world did take sort of the totality of evidence approach in Alzheimer's disease, which could be across multiple molecules in different trials, to give confidence about a particular mechanism, in this case, of course, plaque lowering. Having said that, though, each molecule still have to pass a certain bar of evidence for benefit versus risk in the intended use population. I do think, though, that if ADI is deemed to have a positive effect and our drug ultimately has a positive effect, the convergence of those two events could bode well for both drugs. But there's a lot that has to happen before we get there, Greg. With respect to IL-2, yes, as this molecule progresses in clinical trials, we're growing more confident in the hypothesis that underlies this effort. This is a low-dose pegylated IL-2 that's meant to stimulate T regulatory cells without stimulating effector T cells. And we've now presented data from Phase 1 that should we have exactly that effect in a dose-dependent way. We can boost Tregs. And we hope that that will have a modulatory effect on autoimmune disease. Based on our confidence in the biomarker here and the mechanism of action, we've committed to starting a number of Phase 2 trials here in parallel to understand how these changes in regulatory T cells could translate to clinical benefits for patients in diseases like lupus or IVD or dermatologic disease. And so those trials are starting and we look forward to getting data from them.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Just my question is on Trulicity. It seems like there's two issues kind of impacting the quarter. The first was the timing of the doughnut hole impact and the second was this channel mix issue, if I was hearing you correctly. So I guess on channel mix, is the net of the unfavorable price, I guess, balanced against the higher volumes a net neutral versus your original expectations? Or is volume only partially offsetting this kind of mix issue that you're dealing with, I guess, on that product specifically? And then my second question was on margin evolution going forward. Should we be thinking about the 31% operating margin ex the COVID investments as your baseline to grow off of as we think about 2021 and beyond? Or should we still think about some kind of lingering COVID investments that could impact margins as we move through next year? Thanks so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Mike Mason for the question on Trulicity and then Josh for the question on margin evolution.\nMike Mason: Overall, we're very confident about the growth potential of the GLP class and Trulicity. The GLP class is performing strong with TRx growth of 23% for the quarter during the COVID pandemic. Trulicity continues to hold market share leadership in the face of semaglutide with a 45% share of market. Overall, Trulicity grew volume 26% in the U.S. at a time when patient office visits for Type 2 diabetes remains 20% lower than last year due to the COVID pandemic. When you take a look at segment mix, what we're seeing is that Trulicity performed well in commercial and Part D, holding market share leadership and growing gross sales year-to-date at 29% in commercial and 44% in Part D. Trulicity segment mix was really driven by stronger than expected performance, both share and volume and growing lower priced segments like Medicaid. Even at the lower prices, Medicaid growth brings in profitable business for Lilly and helps people living with diabetes. I'll highlight one decision that we made. During the early stages of the COVID pandemic, we were concerned about people on commercial insurance losing their jobs moving to Medicaid and having to stop take Trulicity because we had lower access in Medicaid. We didn't think this dynamic would be best for people living with diabetes during the pandemic. Thus, we prioritize improving our access in Medicaid to help people living with diabetes. For example, we were upgraded on California Medicaid early in Q2. And we've seen Trulicity volume in California Medicaid nearly double this year, which is really great for everyone. I remain very excited and confident in Trulicity.\nJosh Smiley: On margin, yes, so we've tried to separate out the COVID investments this year, which we've mentioned will -- the expense will be in the range of $400 million for the year. As you know, we've been focused on 31% operating margin as a goal for 2020. And given the guidance that we presented, not including anything from COVID, we're confident we'll achieve that 31%. I think that's the right baseline to think about going forward on an overall basis. Now we will have COVID investments that move into 2021 as we continue the trials that we've already put up and running. Again, though, we are expecting, given the submission of the EUA and the data that we have that there will be, at some point, sales associated with those investments. I think if we look at just isolating the expense and the sales, we'll have to come back on that. We don't have prices or volumes or anything around the world. So I think the COVID piece in 2021, we will have some expense. But realistically, I think the way to think about our business is 31% operating margin, excluding the extraordinary COVID impact and margin expansion then in 2021 and really through 2025, as we've talked about. So I think COVID should help us, I think, from an overall economic perspective in that period, if the product or products are successful. But really I think the focus on long term margin expansion sort of cuts through anything that we see in the near term on COVID. And we're committed to those margin expansion plans that we've talked about pre-pandemic.\nOperator: The next caller is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: First, Dan, in the past, when you have referred to very low dropout rates in SURPASS 1, were you referring to analysis on an intent-to-treat basis? I fear Lilly is preparing us for solid data on an efficacy as demand basis but less compelling on an intent to treat basis? And then the second question is, it was said earlier in the call that Lilly has never been more excited about tirzepatide. I thought that was an interesting choice of words given the importance of the event and the lack of clarity on the status of the trial at this point. It implies that you're more excited than you were in Q2 or Q1 or any time between. So can you tell us if any member of management has any knowledge whatsoever of the results of SURPASS 1? Thank you.\nDan Skovronsky: What we said with respect to people dropping out of our clinical trials was that we hadn't seen an effect from COVID-19. We were quite worried about that in the early days of the pandemic, when the tirzepatide trials have become fully enrolled and were some of the most important and largest trials that we've ever conducted, whether this new pandemic would cause people to stop participating in clinical trials and we didn't see a bump up in dropout rates. I think, though, what you're really interested in is people discontinuation from therapy, which could be different than dropout rates. And we wouldn't know that until we get the data from the trial. With respect to the two different analyses that we comment on the efficacy as demand versus the real intent to treat analysis. You're pointing out, I think that in Phase 2, there was a pretty big difference between these two analyses with the efficacy estimate showing better results than the pure ITT because a number of patients at the highest dose, at the 50-milligram dose, had dropped out due to adverse events. Like I said, we don't know what's happening in SURPASS 1 yet. But when those data come, it will be important to look at those two analyses. Our hope and the way we've designed this trial with a slower dose titration is to avoid discontinuations due to adverse events, which would show that a smaller gap between the efficacy as demand and ITT that we saw in Phase 2.\nMike Mason: Yes. I can assure you that no one and any one at Lilly have seen the results as for SURPASS 1 yet. I think my confidence in tirzepatide from what we knew we've seen is, obviously, there's been a lot of attention on the dose titration scheme that we used in our Phase 2 and the dose titration study as well as Phase 3. We've used a more gradual titration approach in our Phase 3 trials. And as we've seen the readout of AWARD-11, as well as some of the novel step programs who used similar gradual titration, we saw that those schemes did work and that we\u2019re able to produce GI profiles that were acceptable. So that's the new data that we've seen, and we're very confident in tirzepatide.\nOperator: The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Just had a few. Josh, on Trulicity, if I'm hearing you correctly, for 2021, you guys have gone from mid-single to high single-digit price declines, but for the rest of the broader diabetes portfolio and really, overall, is it still mid-single as an assumption? And if you have formulary wins for Trulicity in Medicare or Medicaid but at a lower price, what's your capacity to raise price down the road? And then second question is, just a real quick one to ask if you're seeing any sort of halo effect in the marketplace for metastatic breast share for monarchE currently, or do you think that's going to happen looking to 2021? Thank you.\nJosh Smiley: Yes, on Trulicity, I think as we think about 2021, we are looking at two separate pieces. I think the first is just the underlying unit price where we feel things haven't changed. We really see underlying unit price holding segments constant as being in that low to mid-single-digit impact. I think what we've seen now over two years is we're underestimating how fast segments like Medicaid can grow, and that's what Mike talked about. So I think given the fact that we continue to see good growth in Medicaid, the share performance and utilization is still lower than what we see in commercial and our strong performance in that segment, as well as, as we've talked in prior calls, we expect some Medicaid expansion. We're seeing a little bit of that now. We expect that to persist into 2021. That moves us from that mid single digit Trulicity price to high single digits. So it really is the fact that we do continue to expect faster segment growth in areas like Medicaid. All that being said, I think we'll continue to look at pricing as we have in the past. We price for the system we have today, which is modest list price increases and giving back a little bit more than that in rebates. That's what we've seen over the last few years. I don't anticipate that approach changing unless we have something that changes on the legislative side, if you get as an industry more toward a net price environment as opposed to high-growth rebates and net. But for 2021, we're sort of planning that those things, at least for the beginning of the year, won't change.\nAnne White: So Verzenio has had notable positive momentum right now in the currently approved metastatic breast cancer setting. And you can see that it's steadily gaining market share. We have monthly TRx of approaching 14% now, NBRx of approaching 23%. And then you saw some of the sales being posted, particularly worldwide growth of 49%. And we're now market leader in NBRx in Japan at over 50%. So definitely, momentum. And what we continue to do is really grow the number of physicians who tried Verzenio, and they continue to adopt with really a positive experience and they incorporate it more broadly into their practice. This I think is primarily capitalized on the positive overall survival data from MONARCH 2 in combination with fulvestrant. But we do believe that the positive results from monarchE are really providing them another strong example that Verzenio is differentiated from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. And even prior to those results, there was a steadily growing value of evidence that Verzenio is differentiated with the higher CDK4 selectivity, differentiated continuous dosing of monotherapy indication and then obviously, this OS data, not just in the overall population but in the primary endocrine resistance. So we do think we're seeing a shift in people's perception that this is a best-in-class opportunity, both in the metastatic setting and then potentially in the future as we bring it forward for a new treatment option for patients in the early breast cancer setting. So look forward to more work there.\nOperator: The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks very much for the question. So one question for Dave and then a question for Josh. So Dave, can you talk about key post election policy priorities for the industry? And what specifically Lilly hopes to achieve with the challenges to 340b? And then a question for Josh is if implemented as written, what would be the biggest impact on Lilly's corporate tax rate under the Biden tax plan? And is there a concern that this would have a significant relative impact on U.S. corporations like Lilly versus OUS corporations? Thanks.\nDave Ricks: Of course, the landscape post election is not defined, so we'll need to wait for that to land before we get into too many speculations about the future environment. But I think we can say that as an industry, as we sit around the table and certainly here at Lilly, there's two basic problems in the US drug market that need to be untangled. One is the patient out of pocket cost problem, where we're really the only country on the planet that indexes patient out of pocket cost to list prices that that still happens in a highly prevalent way and actually, the rate of growth in high-deductible plans, including those on exchanges and ACA, is growing. So this problem is getting bigger, not smaller. Of course, we think the answer there is to have cost sharing at least be based on some discounted number much closer to actual price and perhaps all the discounts being passed through. There's other solutions, regulatory ones, other ideas we have, capping deductibles, reducing the amount a co-pay can be for any given transaction through regulation or other avenues. States have done that. And I think we do see good impact on affordability and persistence when that's done. So that's the highest priority for the industry. The second priority and you touched on 340b, is just reducing the amount of distortions in the system, which create artificial winners and losers and shifts money around health care based on sales, which is inappropriate way to fund things in our mind. We'd like to see that disentangled and that kind of services, as it relates to dispensing or formulary management, are based on something to do with the value of those services versus something to do with the drugs that are being dispensed. 340b is one example of that where high-priced drugs move through covered entities at huge margin increases. And those monies go to other purposes not related to drugs. Patients pay more and lose in that equation, and we certainly lose in that equation. So as it relates to 340b actions and other channel actions, we're interested in kind of decomplexifying that and making the system work a little bit better for not just patients but for sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry. So anyway, we'll focus on those things as we have been and we'll have to see what the tactics look like based on electoral outcomes here just a week away.\nJosh Smiley: I think, first, the tax system that we have in the US now does help us compete on a global basis for innovation. I think that's the biggest positive that we've seen. It is a complex system. But having a rate, an underlying rate that's more competitive with our European competitors allows us to attract innovation, keep it in the US. And you've seen that in some of the acquisitions we've done, including companies like Loxo, we\u2019re more competitive when we're competing against OUS companies that have a low corporate tax rate in their countries. So we like that. I think as we look, though, to potential changes, I think the first thing I would say is there's -- having been through the last round here, there's a huge difference between what a high level plan is and how it gets implemented. And the details in that implementation are what actually drives the big point movements. I don't know that we could have sitting in 2017 predicted that we have a 15% rate, for example, as our long term rate here. So there's a lot of work to be done if there is any kind of future tax reform coming. Obviously, the underlying US rate looks like it'll go up. But I think we have a couple of advantages. No matter what happens we invest heavily in R&D among the most heavily of any of our big pharma peers. So we would hope and work to ensure that innovation is rewarded in any tax system going forward. And we have a pretty balanced manufacturing network. We make about half of our plants are in the US and half are outside the US. So I think we we're probably poised to take advantage of any changes that happen in the tax structure going forward. But there's no doubt that having a competitive sort of base rate for the US relative to our OUS peers is something that's, I think, really important for our industry.\nOperator: The next caller is Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Just regarding LOXO-305, can you share any perspective on the registration path for the drug in CLL and if a head to head trial versus IMBRUVICA is still on the table? Thank you.\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. I think at this moment, it's premature to talk about registrational paths. But I can say that we look forward to releasing more data later this year. And I think as we release that data, that's an opportunity to update on our current thinking on the development plan.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: I just wanted to clarify. So with respect to Trulicity, I believe you said that the volume growth was 26% in the quarter. Obviously, the reported U.S. sales growth was 5%, which suggests a 21 percentage point difference. So either way, if that's right, if you could just confirm it, if not, if you could just give us the correct figures. But then could you, for the difference, explain the components? So obviously, last year in the third quarter, the company had missed Trulicity sales expectations due to higher than expected rebates. So the company had a very easy comparison versus the third quarter of '19 for Trulicity. Yet, obviously, the sales disappointed this quarter. So if you could explain that 20% plus percentage point difference in terms of how much was due to rebates versus mix shift, et cetera, and then also help us understand why the mix shift was a surprise given the Medicaid wins that you articulated. And then -- well, actually, I'll just leave it at that. So if you could address those, that would be great.\nMike Mason: As we take a look at pricing performance for Trulicity in Q3, when we take a look at the net impact of rebates to maintain access and list price that was 2% of modest headwind in Q3 of this year. Segment mix was 6% and then the remaining of that was due to onetime events due to coverage GAAP estimates for rebates and discounts. So that's the breakdown of performance for Trulicity in Q3. You may not have been on earlier. As we take a look at Medicaid performance, we're performing quite well in the higher-priced segments of commercial and Part D. We grew gross sales in commercial by 29% year-to-date and Part D by 44%. When we take a look at segment mix, it's really driven by higher than expected, Medicaid really have kind of a triple whammy going there, where as you say COVID is driving more people into Medicaid. We're also seeing that Medicaid in general, is growing for Trulicity because Trulicity's share is lower. And then we did make the conscious decision to win access in Medicaid, because we felt that we're going to see people going from commercial to Medicaid. And we had a lower access in Medicaid than we did in commercial. So we thought it was the right thing to do for patients in order to increase Medicaid, so someone didn't have to go off Trulicity if they lost their job during the pandemic. So that's the breakdown. We're very confident in Trulicity, both pricing and volume going forward.\nOperator: And next question will come from Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: So just two, please, one on tanezumab. I know you mentioned the AdCom. I believe that's a change from the [core one], the FDA is saying that they were not going to do an AdCom. I don't know if you have any insights you can share just on what may have changed to led to leave them to do the advisory committee meeting? And then second on maybe just going back to the Alzheimer's discussion from before. Obviously, a lot of focus on tanezumab early next year. I know you also have an N3pG in Phase 1 development. I'm just curious if you can maybe talk about sort of how that one is different from the one you have in Phase 2 to give us a sense of what you're trying to change their potential. Thanks.\nPatrik Jonsson: Well, thank you very much for the question. We were just updated by the FDA that the PDUFA date is no longer valid and that they are most likely planning to have an Advisory Board in the month of March. And actually, we don't believe this is necessarily negative, taking into account that we have a lot of data on tanezumab. And we have 39 clinical trials and more than 18,000 patients treated. So we actually think even an outboard could be beneficial.\nDan Skovronsky: Vamil, thanks for the question on donanemab and the follow-on N3pG molecule, which you noted is in Phase 1. One of the things that we saw with donanemab was that we had a great PD effect. We could clear plaques quite deeply and quickly but we also had antidrug antibodies. The antibodies weren't at a level that they affected the PK of the drug because we're giving pretty high doses of the drug. Still, it's not optimal to have ADA against your drug. So we created a next gen N3pG that we hypothesize would have the same plaque clearing PD effect but not have antidrug antibodies. So that's the next one that you see there in Phase 1. If danetumab turns out to be a success, it could be useful to have a follow-on molecule that doesn't have ADA. I also point out that in addition to donanemab and that followed into N3pG molecule, the other Alzheimer's molecule we're really quite excited about is zagotenemab, which is our aggregate Taltz specific antibody and that will be reading out later next year.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Vamil, thanks for your questions. And now we'll go back to Dave for the close.\nDave Ricks: Great. Thanks, Kevin. Well, we appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly & Company.

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Q3 was another important quarter for Lilly and the pharmaceutical industry's progress in developing new medicines to treat COVID-19. I'm very proud of Lilly's work and we'll go into detail of the promising advancements made this quarter. However, I'd like to start by summarizing our overall business performance. Clearly, this quarter's financial results came in below sell side analyst projections. While we don't provide quarterly guidance, I'll make a few high level comments on several factors that did impact our Q3 results. And then Josh will go into more detail later. First, as we've discussed in the past, the impact of price on revenue can be volatile in the U.S., as we make estimates for rebates and discounts, obligations during the coverage gap of Medicare Part D patient assistance programs and other liabilities. During Q3, the magnitude of adjustments was meaningful, predominantly related to our assumptions regarding our obligation during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D for Trulicity. While the impact was notable in Q3, this source of volatility normalizes when analyzing our results over the first nine months, as well as for the full year. In addition, while we are encouraged new prescriptions are trending toward pre-COVID levels, the recovery varies by class. We view this important -- this impact is transient, remain confident in the underlying business and continue to manage our operations to deliver success over the long-term. From an operating expense standpoint, we made significant investments in R&D to develop COVID-19 treatments. While we spoken before about our efforts to develop COVID-19 treatments, we've not quantified that investment level. In Q3, we were fortunate to see positive clinical data from multiple trials. And this activity had an impact of about $0.12 on Q3 earnings per share. Finally, after taking a pause on active promotion in Q2 to respect the impact that COVID-19 had on medical practices, we increased our investments in customer facing activity and direct-to-consumer marketing in Q3 in order to accelerate our growth. While this did create a step-up compared to our investment level in SG&A in Q2 2020 and versus Q3 2019, we believe our progress in Q3 sets us up for a strong finish to the year and to provide meaningful momentum into 2021. We have a number of opportunities to drive this growth through these investments in our existing commercial portfolio. These include our unique CD indication for Trulicity and the recently launched higher doses. Pulling through access wins for [Togs] and launching the recently approved non-radiographic axSpA indication and driving increased uptake of Verzenio through our differentiated data package, just to highlight a few. Looking at the underlying trends, in Q3, we delivered revenue growth of 5% or 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Despite disruptions on new patients' charts from the global pandemic, volume growth was solid, increasing by 9% versus Q3 2019. Our key growth products continue to be the catalyst for our business performance and made up over half of our revenue during the quarter. International performance in Europe and China was particularly strong, as constant currency revenue grew 9% and 10% respectively, driven by our newest products. For the first nine months of the year, our revenue grew by 6%, driven by 12% volume growth. This growth was delivered during a period of significant disruption. The ways we launch new medicines, execute clinical trials and manufacturer our products, have all been meaningfully changed during the pandemic, with some adjustments likely to remain as our business continues to evolve. We are proud of our efforts to ensure patients have access to medicines by maintaining our manufacturing plans in continuous operation and by developing potential new treatments for COVID-19. Operating margin as a percent of revenue was 26.2% for the third quarter. This is a decline of 230 basis points versus Q3 2019 but was depressed by $125 million that we invested in COVID-19 therapies during the quarter. Excluding these exceptional activities, operating margin was 28.4%. We have confidence in our outlook and expect to deliver financial results within our updated guidance range, with all lines at or above our original 2020 guidance, and to achieve our operating margin expansion plans, excluding our investments in COVID-19 treatments. The fundamentals of our business are strong and we remain well-positioned for a period of sustained growth and margin expansion. Turning to the pipeline. In Q3, we made meaningful progress advancing our late-stage pipeline and developing potential COVID-19 treatments, including FDA approval of additional doses for Trulicity for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, an important data readout for Verzenio in early breast cancer, approval in Europe for Olumiant in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, positive Phase 3 results from the ACTT-2 trial baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, positive results of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibody monotherapy in combination therapy. And we presented new data on a potential new indication for Jardiance in collaboration with Behringer Ingelheim. I'm encouraged by our company's efforts to develop potential new therapies to treat COVID-19 and working at unprecedented speed. This work would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of many employees of Lilly and the collaborative efforts across the industry, regulators and government. We continue to utilize external innovation and collaborations to augment our internal capabilities. This quarter we signed a number of business development transactions, including the global expansion of our TYVYT collaboration with Innovent. At the same time, we utilized our strong cash flow to return nearly $700 million to shareholders via the dividend. Moving to Slide 5 and 6, you'll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. I would like to welcome Ilya Yuffa to our executive team as he assumes leadership for our Bio-Medicines business unit, a 25 year veteran with a tremendous breadth of experience across our organization from finance, business development and sales to Six Sigma, ethics and compliance and general management. Ilya has consistently delivered impressive results in successful larger roles -- that successively larger roles, which are prepared him well to lead Lilly Bio-Medicines. After serving as General Manager of Italy since 2018, Ilya has been leading Lilly's largest franchise U.S. Diabetes, where he played a critical role in the continued success of the market leading medicine Trulicity as well as Jardiance in the two fastest growing classes in diabetes. Ilya it's great to have you on our leadership team. I'd also like to thank Patrik for his energy, focus and execution that he brought to his time as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines. Given Patrik's strong record of successfully managing Lilly businesses in complex markets around the world, he is the right enterprise leader to lead Lilly USA and our global customer focused functions during this exciting period of opportunity and growth, as we look to continue to deliver new medicines to patients. Before I turn the call over to Josh to review our Q3 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020, I want to discuss briefly certain events at one of our manufacturing facilities located in Branchburg, New Jersey. Late last year, our Branchburg plant underwent a routine FDA general surveillance inspection. The inspectors identified findings related to data handling and we received an official action indicated notice, as well as a follow up inspection this year. We have not received a warning letter or other enforcement letter from the FDA at this time. Given that this plant is among several worldwide that produces bamlanivimab or Lilly SARS-CoV-555, one of our COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, I want to share more information about our response to these inspections. First, we are confident the issues raised during the inspections did not impact product quality or patient safety for bamlanivimab or for any other product manufactured at the Branchburg plant. Having said that, we and I take remediation of these data handling issues and our commitment to quality and safety very seriously. We engaged an external firm to conduct a comprehensive independent review of systems at the Branchburg site, and we were working diligently to incorporate suggestions for improvement to our procedures. We have also had this firm perform independent reviews of our manufacturing of bamlanivimab at Branchburg to examine our manufacturing batch records and quality documentation to corroborate our own batch release decisions as we submit for supply of bamlanivimab from Branchburg for the emergency use authorization we requested. We are confident in the material at this facility and frankly at all of our sites. Finally for our neutralizing antibodies, we have a robust global supply chain in place with five active ingredient manufacturing sites worldwide in addition to five additional drug product sites worldwide. Branchburg is one of the active ingredients sites. Once we are approved to do so, our resilient global network is well positioned to begin the supply as we help battle this global pandemic. Now, let me turn it over to Josh. Thanks, Dan. 2020 has been a difficult yet remarkable year. Despite challenges and the resulting choppiness of our quarterly results, we've delivered volume-driven growth of 6% through the first three quarters of this year. Excluding investments in COVID-19 therapies, we've expanded our operating margin by 160 basis points compared to the first three quarters of 2019. We've made meaningful progress this year on our innovation-based strategy, launching three new medicines and a number of NILEX, delivering important data readouts for key pipeline molecules and developing and submitting EUAs for potential treatment for virus unknown to the world at this time last year. And over the next few months, we have several highly anticipated pipeline readouts on deck. We continue to look for opportunities to augment the future growth of our company through business development and then return excess capital to shareholders. While the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to challenge us, the growth products in our commercial portfolio, limited patent expiry in the next five years and margin expansion opportunities before us, as well as upcoming data readouts in the pipeline, I like our prospects. And I thank my Lilly teammates for persevering and performing amidst the year of challenges to continue to deliver meaningful innovation for the patients we serve. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A. Of course, the landscape post election is not defined, so we'll need to wait for that to land before we get into too many speculations about the future environment. But I think we can say that as an industry, as we sit around the table and certainly here at Lilly, there's two basic problems in the US drug market that need to be untangled. One is the patient out of pocket cost problem, where we're really the only country on the planet that indexes patient out of pocket cost to list prices that that still happens in a highly prevalent way and actually, the rate of growth in high-deductible plans, including those on exchanges and ACA, is growing. So this problem is getting bigger, not smaller. Of course, we think the answer there is to have cost sharing at least be based on some discounted number much closer to actual price and perhaps all the discounts being passed through. There's other solutions, regulatory ones, other ideas we have, capping deductibles, reducing the amount a co-pay can be for any given transaction through regulation or other avenues. States have done that. And I think we do see good impact on affordability and persistence when that's done. So that's the highest priority for the industry. The second priority and you touched on 340b, is just reducing the amount of distortions in the system, which create artificial winners and losers and shifts money around health care based on sales, which is inappropriate way to fund things in our mind. We'd like to see that disentangled and that kind of services, as it relates to dispensing or formulary management, are based on something to do with the value of those services versus something to do with the drugs that are being dispensed. 340b is one example of that where high-priced drugs move through covered entities at huge margin increases. And those monies go to other purposes not related to drugs. Patients pay more and lose in that equation, and we certainly lose in that equation. So as it relates to 340b actions and other channel actions, we're interested in kind of decomplexifying that and making the system work a little bit better for not just patients but for sustainability of the pharmaceutical industry. So anyway, we'll focus on those things as we have been and we'll have to see what the tactics look like based on electoral outcomes here just a week away. Great. Thanks, Kevin. Well, we appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly & Company. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions that were not addressed today. And I hope everyone stays well during this difficult time. Take care, and we'll be in touch."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "So Verzenio has had notable positive momentum right now in the currently approved metastatic breast cancer setting. And you can see that it's steadily gaining market share. We have monthly TRx of approaching 14% now, NBRx of approaching 23%. And then you saw some of the sales being posted, particularly worldwide growth of 49%. And we're now market leader in NBRx in Japan at over 50%. So definitely, momentum. And what we continue to do is really grow the number of physicians who tried Verzenio, and they continue to adopt with really a positive experience and they incorporate it more broadly into their practice. This I think is primarily capitalized on the positive overall survival data from MONARCH 2 in combination with fulvestrant. But we do believe that the positive results from monarchE are really providing them another strong example that Verzenio is differentiated from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. And even prior to those results, there was a steadily growing value of evidence that Verzenio is differentiated with the higher CDK4 selectivity, differentiated continuous dosing of monotherapy indication and then obviously, this OS data, not just in the overall population but in the primary endocrine resistance. So we do think we're seeing a shift in people's perception that this is a best-in-class opportunity, both in the metastatic setting and then potentially in the future as we bring it forward for a new treatment option for patients in the early breast cancer setting. So look forward to more work there."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Mike Mason",
            "content": "We've never been more excited about our tirzepatide program. In our Phase 2 Type 2 diabetes studies, 43% of people on tirzepatide had reached a final A1c of 5.7%, which is normal A1c versus only 2% for the market leader, Trulicity. 34% of people on tirzepatide lost more than 15% of their body weight versus 2% for Trulicity. And tirzepatide will be delivered in the same patient-friendly device of Trulicity. Tirzepatide has the opportunity to become a foundational treatment for someone living with Type 2 diabetes that not only need A1c control but could benefit from significant weight loss, which brings additional metabolic health benefits. Further, we're very excited about what tirzepatide can do in obesity and NASH. As you take a look at the results from SURPASS 1, later this year we'll get the results. We'll issue a press release that will likely be top line results. We won't have full data, be able to do a full analysis that will come later at medical meetings in 2021. Overall, we're very confident about the growth potential of the GLP class and Trulicity. The GLP class is performing strong with TRx growth of 23% for the quarter during the COVID pandemic. Trulicity continues to hold market share leadership in the face of semaglutide with a 45% share of market. Overall, Trulicity grew volume 26% in the U.S. at a time when patient office visits for Type 2 diabetes remains 20% lower than last year due to the COVID pandemic. When you take a look at segment mix, what we're seeing is that Trulicity performed well in commercial and Part D, holding market share leadership and growing gross sales year-to-date at 29% in commercial and 44% in Part D. Trulicity segment mix was really driven by stronger than expected performance, both share and volume and growing lower priced segments like Medicaid. Even at the lower prices, Medicaid growth brings in profitable business for Lilly and helps people living with diabetes. I'll highlight one decision that we made. During the early stages of the COVID pandemic, we were concerned about people on commercial insurance losing their jobs moving to Medicaid and having to stop take Trulicity because we had lower access in Medicaid. We didn't think this dynamic would be best for people living with diabetes during the pandemic. Thus, we prioritize improving our access in Medicaid to help people living with diabetes. For example, we were upgraded on California Medicaid early in Q2. And we've seen Trulicity volume in California Medicaid nearly double this year, which is really great for everyone. I remain very excited and confident in Trulicity. Yes. I can assure you that no one and any one at Lilly have seen the results as for SURPASS 1 yet. I think my confidence in tirzepatide from what we knew we've seen is, obviously, there's been a lot of attention on the dose titration scheme that we used in our Phase 2 and the dose titration study as well as Phase 3. We've used a more gradual titration approach in our Phase 3 trials. And as we've seen the readout of AWARD-11, as well as some of the novel step programs who used similar gradual titration, we saw that those schemes did work and that we're able to produce GI profiles that were acceptable. So that's the new data that we've seen, and we're very confident in tirzepatide. As we take a look at pricing performance for Trulicity in Q3, when we take a look at the net impact of rebates to maintain access and list price that was 2% of modest headwind in Q3 of this year. Segment mix was 6% and then the remaining of that was due to onetime events due to coverage GAAP estimates for rebates and discounts. So that's the breakdown of performance for Trulicity in Q3. You may not have been on earlier. As we take a look at Medicaid performance, we're performing quite well in the higher-priced segments of commercial and Part D. We grew gross sales in commercial by 29% year-to-date and Part D by 44%. When we take a look at segment mix, it's really driven by higher than expected, Medicaid really have kind of a triple whammy going there, where as you say COVID is driving more people into Medicaid. We're also seeing that Medicaid in general, is growing for Trulicity because Trulicity's share is lower. And then we did make the conscious decision to win access in Medicaid, because we felt that we're going to see people going from commercial to Medicaid. And we had a lower access in Medicaid than we did in commercial. So we thought it was the right thing to do for patients in order to increase Medicaid, so someone didn't have to go off Trulicity if they lost their job during the pandemic. So that's the breakdown. We're very confident in Trulicity, both pricing and volume going forward."

            "name": "Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Josh. Since our last call, we've made meaningful progress developing potential treatments for COVID-19, advancing key assets in our pipeline and presenting practice changing clinical trial data at major medical meetings. I'll begin with updates to our COVID-19 viral neutralizing antibody program. Then I'll provide an update on the full pipeline. And I'll finish by highlighting key events since the last quarter. Moving to Slide 15, Lilly is testing single antibody therapy, as well as combinations of antibodies in several trials across two different patient populations; first, is the treatment of recently diagnosed ambulatory patients; and second, in the prophylactic or preventative setting amongst nursing home residents and staff; a third, more severely ill population, i. e. hospitalized patients, has been studied in the ACTIV-3 trial only. This clinical trial is being run by the NIH and is the only study evaluating the efficacy of bamlanivimab, also known as LY-CoV555 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Based on an updated data set from the trial reviewed yesterday by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board, no additional COVID-19 patients in this hospitalized setting will receive bamlanivimab. The board's recommendation was based on trial data suggesting that the addition of bamlanivimab to remdesivir and other treatments used in the hospitalized setting is unlikely to further help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover from this advanced stage of the disease. In this updated data set, differences in safety outcomes between the bamlanivimab and placebo groups were not significant. Importantly, all other studies of bamlanivimab remain ongoing, including ACTIV-2, the NIH sponsored study in recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 patients. BLAZE-1, Lylly's ongoing Phase 2 trial in people recently diagnosed with COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting, which is studying bamlanivimab as monotherapy and in combination with etesevimab, also known as LY-CoV016. And BLAZE-2, Lylly's Phase 2 study of bamlanivimab for the prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff in long-term care facilities. While there was insufficient evidence from ACTIV-3, the bamlanivimab improved clinical outcomes when added to other treatments in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. We remain confident based on data from released BLAZE-1 study that bamlanivimab monotherapy may prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of COVID-19. While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don't expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis or in early treatment. And we think the patients, physicians and staff participating in all clinical trials of our neutralizing antibodies, including ACTIV-3. Regarding the Lilly sponsored COVID-19 neutralizing antibody program, we made key advances in the third quarter, which include: We initiated BLAZE-2, the Phase 3 trials studying post exposure prophylaxis for residents and staff in nursing homes; We reported proof of concept data for bamlanivimab monotherapy in BLAZE-1, demonstrating a reduction in hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting; We reported that the combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab met the primary and secondary endpoints at an interim analysis of BLAZE-1, significantly reducing viral load and symptoms, as well as meaningfully reducing hospitalizations and ER visits in the outpatient setting. And we submitted a request for emergency use authorization to the FDA for bamlanivimab monotherapy in higher risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19. We were particularly encouraged to show that neutralizing antibodies can help people clear virus more quickly improve symptoms and most importantly, prevent serious medical outcomes, like hospitalizations and ER visits. Notably, the pooled data of monotherapy and combination therapy showed a reduction of hospitalizations and ER visits of greater than 75% across all patients. In addition, the monotherapy and combination therapy had an even larger effect size in high risk patients, defined by body mass index ratio. We've now dosed approximately 1,000 trial participants with bamlanivimab alone or in combination with etesevimab, and we've shared safety and tolerability data from more than 400 patients in the monotherapy and combination therapy arms of BLAZE-1 on our call earlier this month, where we noted that monotherapy and combination therapy were both generally well tolerated with no significant safety concerns. No clinically meaningful differences and treatment emergent adverse events were observed across the treatment groups and the majority of treatment emergent adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. And there have been no drug related serious adverse events reported thus far. We continue to recruit patients in BLAZE-1. While the FDA is still reviewing our request for EUA for monotherapy, we will soon be ready to request emergency use authorization for combination therapy and we intend to submit that request to the FDA as early as November. Another achievement this quarter as part of our efforts to develop potential treatments for COVID-19 was the positive outcome of baricitinib in the NIH sponsored ACT-2 trial of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Baricitinib in combination with remdesivir significantly reduced time to recovery and improved clinical outcomes. The numerical decrease in mortality compared to remdesivir alone was also demonstrated. These results were most pronounced in patients receiving oxygen. Based on these data, we submitted a request for emergency use authorization for baricitinib to the FDA, and global regulatory discussions are ongoing. With two submissions to the FDA this month for request for emergency use authorizations and with our neutralizing antibody combination therapy providing the potential for a third in November, I'm particularly proud of the progress we've made over such a short period of time to rapidly develop potential new solutions to aid physicians and patients in the battle against this pandemic. Moving to Slide 16, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of October 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes approval for Trulicity alternative dose, approval for baricitinib in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, the previously mentioned initiation of the BLAZE-2 Phase 3 trial, the advancement of two immunology programs into Phase 2, the initiation of two Phase 1 programs and the termination of a Phase 1 diabetes asset and termination of our Ang2 antibodies Phase 2 proof of concept study in COVID-19 due to futility. We also saw results from the Phase 2 trial of Mevidalen, our D1-positive allosteric modulator in patients with lewy body disease. While we were disappointed that the study did not meet its primary cognitive end point at week 12, Mevidalen did show encouraging motor and non-motor benefits, and we are evaluating the next steps for this program at this time. In addition, Pfizer and Lilly have been informed by the USFDA that the agency intends to hold an Advisory Committee Meeting, likely in the March 2021 timeframe to discuss the tanezumab application. As a result, the FDA's review will obviously extend beyond the current December 2020 PDUFA date. However, the FDA has not provided a new action date. The agency communicated that its review of the application is ongoing and has not requested any new clinical studies to be completed at this time. Pfizer and Lilly will continue to work with the FDA as it completes its review of the application. Moving to Slide 17, we provide an update on our 2020 key events. The first nine months of 2020 have been incredibly productive, as highlighted by a significant number of positive key milestones with only a few exceptions. We've delivered on the key events that we outlined back in December 2019 and we've added several more. Most notably since the last earnings call, we've had regulatory approvals for important new indications and line extensions for Trulicity, Taltz and Olumiant. In collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we also presented results from EMPEROR-Reduced trial in patients with heart failure with reduce ejection fraction or HFREF. Jardiance demonstrated 25% reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. In addition, Jardiance had a positive effect in key secondary end points, including first hospitalization for heart failure and an exploratory renal composite end point. EMPEROR-Reduced included patients with and without diabetes. And these data are encouraging to expand the use of Jardiance in patients with HFREF. They also add to the existing body of evidence showing that cardiovascular and renal benefits of Jardiance, as first demonstrated in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We're on track to submit these data to regulators later this year and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trial in HFpEF in 2021. We also presented important data for Verzenio in early breast cancer at the virtual ESMO meeting this quarter, confirming that Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to demonstrate a benefit in this population and the first advancement for these patients in almost two decades. Verzenio showed 25% reduction in risk of cancer recurrence at two year landmark analysis. Verzenio also reduced the risk of distant metastases by 28%, an essential objective for any novel therapy in HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer, as distant recurrence is currently an incurable event. This is an important observation that bodes well for overall survival, since according to published literature, improvements in distant relapse-free survival have been shown to be a leading indicator for improved overall survival. The monarchE study is ongoing. Study participants will remain on trial and continue to be followed, and additional results will be presented in the future. As we stated previously, we intend to submit for regulatory review by the end of the year. We anticipate a standard review time line with the FDA. While there have been many positive pipeline events already this year, we still have two important readouts to come yet this year and a number of updates that will occur during the first half of 2021. Before year end, we'll present additional data from the Phase 1/2 BRUIN study for LOXO-305, our BTK inhibitor. We'll also have top line results from SURPASS 1, the first Phase 3 trial to readout from the tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes program. SURPASS 1 is a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial. We look forward to sharing these data in the coming months for this important program that we believe will raise the bar for treatment expectations for patients with Type 2 diabetes. We have a lot of momentum in R&D at Lilly, which will carry into 2021 where we have a number of additional data readouts, including the remainder of the registrational Phase 3 tirzepatide Type 2 diabetes trials; Phase 3 data for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis; Phase 3 data from lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; Phase 3 Jardiance HFPEF data; Phase 2 data from two Alzheimer's trials, including an important readout from our plaque-clearing antibody, denenab, expected early in Q1 2021. We remain excited about the potential of this molecule to make a real difference for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we look forward to multiple potential proof-of-concept studies from our early-stage portfolios in immunology, neuroscience, diabetes and oncology. We've risen to the challenge this year as we engaged in the fight against COVID-19. We showed our adaptability and commitment to developing medicines through innovative ways. I'm inspired by the indefatigable effort by our teams in their pursuit of new medicines for patients. Dave, back to you for some closing remarks. Thanks Louise for the question on the AdCom. Of course, like everyone else, we'll be watching it with a great interest. But I don't think I can handicap it one way or the other. The way I see it, the important observation here is around the evidence that lowering plaques can lead to cognitive benefits in Alzheimer's disease. I think we've seen it across a couple of data presentations now. And that's what gives us confidence in our own donanemab, our N3pG antibody that's currently in Phase 2. Just as a reminder, this is a pretty large Phase 2. We've designed it with special care, enrolling a very homogenous group of patients so that it could be powered to show us an efficacy signal, if present. And we look forward to seeing that data early next year. Of course, A4 is an ongoing trial in patients who are presymptomatic. They don't even have the symptoms Alzheimer's disease but they have amyloid plaques as detected by imaging. And we're testing solanezumab and now a higher dose of solanezumab can have a benefit in those patients. We haven't commented on whether or not there could be opportunities for an interim look here. And right now, we're just focused on the final analysis in that trial. With respect to the timing of the tirzepatide trial and the details on clinicaltrials.gov, I can just reconfirm what we said earlier on the call, which is that we expect to have that data and top line in coming months. It's obviously a major event for us. And you can assume that when we get that data, we're going to turn it around quite quickly. I think on Alzheimer's disease, your question is how will the FDA think about sort of a class effect here for multiple plaque lowering antibodies show the same result or if they show different results. I don't know. I mean I can't speculate on agency actions. But I can say that it wouldn't surprise me if regulators around the world did take sort of the totality of evidence approach in Alzheimer's disease, which could be across multiple molecules in different trials, to give confidence about a particular mechanism, in this case, of course, plaque lowering. Having said that, though, each molecule still have to pass a certain bar of evidence for benefit versus risk in the intended use population. I do think, though, that if ADI is deemed to have a positive effect and our drug ultimately has a positive effect, the convergence of those two events could bode well for both drugs. But there's a lot that has to happen before we get there, Greg. With respect to IL-2, yes, as this molecule progresses in clinical trials, we're growing more confident in the hypothesis that underlies this effort. This is a low-dose pegylated IL-2 that's meant to stimulate T regulatory cells without stimulating effector T cells. And we've now presented data from Phase 1 that should we have exactly that effect in a dose-dependent way. We can boost Tregs. And we hope that that will have a modulatory effect on autoimmune disease. Based on our confidence in the biomarker here and the mechanism of action, we've committed to starting a number of Phase 2 trials here in parallel to understand how these changes in regulatory T cells could translate to clinical benefits for patients in diseases like lupus or IVD or dermatologic disease. And so those trials are starting and we look forward to getting data from them. What we said with respect to people dropping out of our clinical trials was that we hadn't seen an effect from COVID-19. We were quite worried about that in the early days of the pandemic, when the tirzepatide trials have become fully enrolled and were some of the most important and largest trials that we've ever conducted, whether this new pandemic would cause people to stop participating in clinical trials and we didn't see a bump up in dropout rates. I think, though, what you're really interested in is people discontinuation from therapy, which could be different than dropout rates. And we wouldn't know that until we get the data from the trial. With respect to the two different analyses that we comment on the efficacy as demand versus the real intent to treat analysis. You're pointing out, I think that in Phase 2, there was a pretty big difference between these two analyses with the efficacy estimate showing better results than the pure ITT because a number of patients at the highest dose, at the 50-milligram dose, had dropped out due to adverse events. Like I said, we don't know what's happening in SURPASS 1 yet. But when those data come, it will be important to look at those two analyses. Our hope and the way we've designed this trial with a slower dose titration is to avoid discontinuations due to adverse events, which would show that a smaller gap between the efficacy as demand and ITT that we saw in Phase 2. Yes. I think at this moment, it's premature to talk about registrational paths. But I can say that we look forward to releasing more data later this year. And I think as we release that data, that's an opportunity to update on our current thinking on the development plan. Vamil, thanks for the question on donanemab and the follow-on N3pG molecule, which you noted is in Phase 1. One of the things that we saw with donanemab was that we had a great PD effect. We could clear plaques quite deeply and quickly but we also had antidrug antibodies. The antibodies weren't at a level that they affected the PK of the drug because we're giving pretty high doses of the drug. Still, it's not optimal to have ADA against your drug. So we created a next gen N3pG that we hypothesize would have the same plaque clearing PD effect but not have antidrug antibodies. So that's the next one that you see there in Phase 1. If danetumab turns out to be a success, it could be useful to have a follow-on molecule that doesn't have ADA. I also point out that in addition to donanemab and that followed into N3pG molecule, the other Alzheimer's molecule we're really quite excited about is zagotenemab, which is our aggregate Taltz specific antibody and that will be reading out later next year."

We were just updated by the FDA that the PDUFA date is no longer valid and that they are most likely planning to have an Advisory Board in the month of March. And actually, we don't believe this is necessarily negative, taking into account that we have a lot of data on tanezumab. And we have 39 clinical trials and more than 18,000 patients treated.

            "content": "Thanks, Dave and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 7 and 8, you will see our non-GAAP financial performance in Q3 and during the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 5% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as key growth products drove volume growth. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q3 was 79.1%, a decline of 50 basis points versus Q3 2019, driven primarily by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold and lower realized prices, partially offset by favorable manufacturing efficiencies and product mix. Moving down the P&L. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 11% this quarter compared to Q3 2019, as we invested meaningfully in direct to consumer marketing to augment our virtual tactics, increasing promotion to physicians and consumers in connection with increases in healthcare utilization around the world. As I'll discuss in our guidance in a few minutes, we see the absolute level of third quarter SG&A expenses as indicative of our fourth quarter expenditures as well, which keeps us on track for our full year ranges and modest full year growth. Research and development expenses increased by 6% in the quarter, driven primarily by our efforts to develop COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies and baricitinib for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, partially offset by lower development expenses for late stage assets. In total, operating income decreased 4% compared to Q3 2019 as increased investments, including COVID-19 related R&D expenses, exceeded revenue growth during the quarter. We expect the increased marketing activity and customer activation to drive additional revenue growth going forward. During the first nine months of 2020, operating income increased by 7% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 26.2% during the third quarter and 28.1% for the first nine months of 2020. As Dave mentioned earlier, our investments in COVID-19 therapies represented investment outside of our normal business operations. So excluding R&D expenses of $180 million associated with these important programs, our operating margin during the first nine months of 2020 would have been 29.2% and consistent with our guidance, we expect continued improvement in Q4. We continue to allocate resources efficiently in an environment where COVID-19 is likely to have an impact for a sustained period of time. We've made the transition to a hybrid virtual and in person commercial model to support executing our strategy and we're committed to margin expansion in 2020 and beyond. Other income and expense was income of $159 million this quarter compared to expense of $25 million in Q3 2019. This quarter's other income was primarily driven by investment gains across our portfolio of public and private biopharma company investments as part of our external innovation strategy. As we regularly your highlight, this line can be volatile as public and private equity valuations fluctuate. We've received quite a bit of investor feedback on this item. So beginning in 2021, we will exclude the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures. We believe this will better align our non-GAAP results with our core business operations, allow for easier comparisons with our peer group and remove unpredictable volatility. This quarter, our tax rate was 15.5%, an increase of 380 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and lower net discrete tax benefits this quarter versus the same quarter last year. While we expect some quarterly variability, we remain comfortable with long-term expectations of roughly 14% to 15% tax rate under the current US corporate tax structure. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 4%. During the first nine months of 2020, earnings per share increased 20%. On Slide 9 and 10, we describe the effect of price, rates and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue increased 5% during Q3 as volume growth of 9% was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange rates had 1% positive impact on revenue growth. During the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew 6%, driven by volume growth of 12%. Price was a 6% drag on worldwide growth or 4% if you exclude the impact of Alimta and Tyvyt in China. U.S. revenue grew 3% compared to the third quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 7% was led by Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo and the impact on Tradjenta from the restructuring of the BI alliance. In line with our expectations, price was a 4% drag on US revenue growth. 3% points were due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Trulicity. 1% point was due to the net impact of increased rebates across the portfolio to maintain our strong commercial access, partially offset by modest list price increases. While typically we do not discuss detailed pricing dynamics for individual products, I will provide some additional commentary on the impact of price on Trulicity performance in Q3. In prior quarters, we assumed our Part D coverage gap liability would shift to later in the year due to short-term deferral of healthcare utilization caused by the impact of COVID-19 and the increased threshold for entry into the coverage gap. However informed by recent invoices from our Part D customers, we now anticipate similar patterns to prior years. So this resulted in updated estimates that led to a meaningful impact on Q3 results and a double digit drag on Trulicity's growth rate. Our estimated coverage gap impact for the full year though is largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of the one-time adjustments, Trulicity's price declined by high single digits in the third quarter versus Q3 2019 and low double digits for the first nine months of 2020. We expect a high single digit price decline for Trulicity for the full year. Last year, we guided toward a mid-single digit price decline for Trulicity. We expected this to be driven by increasing rebates rates to maintain our excellent access, partially offset by modest list price increases and modest growth in more highly rebated segments. As 2020 has unfolded, the negative impact of price on Trulicity growth has been higher than we expected, primarily due to segment mix. On Slide 10, we show the impact of segment next and rate on Trulicity growth in 2019 and 2020. While rate was a pricing headwinds, the net impact of modest list price increases and increased rebate rates has been mid-single digits or lower, which is consistent with our expectations. Moving to segment mix. While the commercial segment continues to deliver robust growth, lower net price segments have grown significantly faster. This depressed Trulicity's reported growth by approximately 7 percentage points in 2019 and 6% percentage points through the first nine months of 2020. This continued growth in 2020 exceeded our expectations and was primarily driven by Medicaid and to a lesser extent Medicare in other segments. Within Medicaid, we experienced formulary changes in key states, faster than anticipated pull through of access wins and expansion of total Medicaid lives this year. Trulicity currently has 45% share of market across all segments and continues to be the market leading GLP-1. We exited in Q3 with a similar share of market in the commercial sector segment. However, consistent with volume growth, we gained 4.5 percentage points of share in Medicaid in other segments since Q1 2019 and finished the quarter at a 38% share of market. It's worth noting that utilization of GLP-1 as a class is still immature and low market penetration suggests significant opportunity for additional growth across all segments. GLP-1s are used less in Medicaid and Medicare, and we expect disproportionate volume growth in these segments to continue. Although, these volume gains have a lower realized price than our commercial business, they do represent profitable business and are able Trulicity help more people living with diabetes. So as we project into 2021, we expect continued strong Trulicity access and performance across all segments with modest unit price declines and continued faster growth in lower price segments, to result in high single-digit total net price declines in 2021. However, I would note that this faster segment growth, which contributes to the net price decline, also shows up as higher overall prescription growth for GLP-1s as well. Our outlook for total US pricing trends remains unchanged and we continue to expect mid single-digit price declines for the full year in 2020, as well as moving into 2021. This mid single-digit price decline outlook includes, as we noted last quarter, a modest impact in 2020 from the affected increased US unemployment on segment mix, as well as approximately $100 million to $200 million of impact in 2021. Okay. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 9% in constant currency and volume grew by 10%, partially offset by price. Volume growth is positively impacted by Alimta in Germany due to our patent appeal victory and a court ordered injunction against generics that had entered the market, as well as Trulicity, Taltz, Olumiant and Verzenio. In Japan, revenue grew 1% in constant currency ad 5% volume growth was partially offset by government mandated price decreases that were effective March 2020. Japan revenue benefited from a one-time sale of Cialis, as well as good volume growth from Verzenio and Trulicity, partially offset by increased competition for Forteo. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency, driven by 51% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. These programs help drive China's significant volume growth, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medicines. We're excited about the momentum of our China oncology business and look forward to receiving regulatory action on Verzenio in the coming months. Outside of our oncology portfolio in China, recently launched products Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance and Olumiant, continue to have strong uptick. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth products, strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance and Olumiant was partially offset by decreased Humalog, Forteo, Cialis and Humulin volume. As shown on Slide 11, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 13 percentage points of volume growth this quarter. The strong volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE product for Forteo, as well as reduced Trajenta royalties from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim announced last year. We end the first nine months of 2020 pleased that our key growth products have contributed approximately 15% year-to-date volume growth. Slide 12 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 52% of revenue. Though our key products are well-positioned to drive strong performance over the long term, we continue to see an impact from reduced patient starts due to COVID-19. In Q3, we were encouraged to see new patient starts recover off the troughs experienced in Q2 as the health system reopened around the world. While different classes have recorded different rates, most classes remain 10% to 20% below pre-COVID baselines. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first nine months of 2020, we invested nearly $6 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D, including the addition of lebrikizumab in a number of early stage agreements. In addition, we returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend. We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt market at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long-term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets. And we do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel or market uncertainty to affect our efforts. Moving to Slide 14, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance and this is based on our best estimates at this time. Key assumptions supporting the guidance, include: Healthcare activity will continue the positive trends seen in Q3, returning to historical levels as doctors utilize telehealth or in-person visits despite additional COVID-19 outbreaks; New patient prescriptions will continue to improve in the US; Pricing headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability program and changes in segment mix due to increased US unemployment will continue to be modest; and, promotional spend will constitute a mix of in person customer interactions, direct-to-consumer advertising, and investments in digital promotion. While uncertainty remains regarding resurgent waves of COVID-19 and any resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we do believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that most patients will find ways to access healthcare. So based on these assumptions, we're maintaining our current full-year revenue range. At the low end of the range, year-over-year sales growth in Q4 would be 8% to 9%, which while a step up from our third quarter growth rate, is supported by current volume trends and our expectations of more limited price impacts in the U.S. Achieving the higher end of the range likely requires some moderate sales from our COVID antibody, which we believe is possible but of course not certain at this point. Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin as a percent of revenue is unchanged on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are narrowing our range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses to $6 billion to $6.1 billion. We are narrowing our range for research and development expenses to $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion, with investment in COVID-19 treatments of approximately $400 million for the full year likely to push us to the high end of our range as Lilly continue to self fund these programs. We believe these investments are critical to help combat the global pandemic. We're noting that our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% excludes our substantial investments in COVID-19 treatment and any associated revenue with them. Inclusive of these costs, we expect an operating margin of approximately 29%. While these investments put near-term pressure on our operating margin, they continue to be the right decision for our company and for society. In post launch, we do expect these therapies to be accretive to our operating income. We're updating the range of other income and expense to $450 million to $600 million of income, reflecting additional gains in our equity portfolio seen in the third quarter. As previously mentioned, this number is subject to volatility of the capital markets. Turning to taxes. We're maintaining our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance at approximately 14%. Earnings per share are unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. As I noted with the revenue range, our EPS totals in Q4 will be highly dependent on COVID sales, which is why we're maintaining a pretty broad $0.20 range as we head into the fourth quarter. We exit Q3 well positioned to continue delivering revenue growth and productivity, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We're proud of the investments we were making to help combat COVID-19 and are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to overcome challenges. Based on our current outlook for Q4, we believe we'll exit the year with strong underlying momentum for 2021. So I'll now turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q3 and an overall pipeline update. Yes, I think as we look at sales guidance and the implied Q4 absolute numbers we see the trends. Now, we're at the end of October. I think we feel good about the lower end of the range for sure, based on just commercial performance of our products around the world. We have submitted an EUA. Dan talked about the data behind that. So I think it's reasonable to include a potential upside associated with some sales of that antibody to governments around the world in Q4. Of course, it is uncertain. That is why we've kept the range. On margin, yes, so we've tried to separate out the COVID investments this year, which we've mentioned will -- the expense will be in the range of $400 million for the year. As you know, we've been focused on 31% operating margin as a goal for 2020. And given the guidance that we presented, not including anything from COVID, we're confident we'll achieve that 31%. I think that's the right baseline to think about going forward on an overall basis. Now we will have COVID investments that move into 2021 as we continue the trials that we've already put up and running. Again, though, we are expecting, given the submission of the EUA and the data that we have that there will be, at some point, sales associated with those investments. I think if we look at just isolating the expense and the sales, we'll have to come back on that. We don't have prices or volumes or anything around the world. So I think the COVID piece in 2021, we will have some expense. But realistically, I think the way to think about our business is 31% operating margin, excluding the extraordinary COVID impact and margin expansion then in 2021 and really through 2025, as we've talked about. So I think COVID should help us, I think, from an overall economic perspective in that period, if the product or products are successful. But really I think the focus on long term margin expansion sort of cuts through anything that we see in the near term on COVID. And we're committed to those margin expansion plans that we've talked about pre-pandemic. Yes, on Trulicity, I think as we think about 2021, we are looking at two separate pieces. I think the first is just the underlying unit price where we feel things haven't changed. We really see underlying unit price holding segments constant as being in that low to mid-single-digit impact. I think what we've seen now over two years is we're underestimating how fast segments like Medicaid can grow, and that's what Mike talked about. So I think given the fact that we continue to see good growth in Medicaid, the share performance and utilization is still lower than what we see in commercial and our strong performance in that segment, as well as, as we've talked in prior calls, we expect some Medicaid expansion. We're seeing a little bit of that now. We expect that to persist into 2021. That moves us from that mid single digit Trulicity price to high single digits. So it really is the fact that we do continue to expect faster segment growth in areas like Medicaid. All that being said, I think we'll continue to look at pricing as we have in the past. We price for the system we have today, which is modest list price increases and giving back a little bit more than that in rebates. That's what we've seen over the last few years. I don't anticipate that approach changing unless we have something that changes on the legislative side, if you get as an industry more toward a net price environment as opposed to high-growth rebates and net. But for 2021, we're sort of planning that those things, at least for the beginning of the year, won't change. I think, first, the tax system that we have in the US now does help us compete on a global basis for innovation. I think that's the biggest positive that we've seen. It is a complex system. But having a rate, an underlying rate that's more competitive with our European competitors allows us to attract innovation, keep it in the US. And you've seen that in some of the acquisitions we've done, including companies like Loxo, we're more competitive when we're competing against OUS companies that have a low corporate tax rate in their countries. So we like that. I think as we look, though, to potential changes, I think the first thing I would say is there's -- having been through the last round here, there's a huge difference between what a high level plan is and how it gets implemented. And the details in that implementation are what actually drives the big point movements. I don't know that we could have sitting in 2017 predicted that we have a 15% rate, for example, as our long term rate here. So there's a lot of work to be done if there is any kind of future tax reform coming. Obviously, the underlying US rate looks like it'll go up. But I think we have a couple of advantages. No matter what happens we invest heavily in R&D among the most heavily of any of our big pharma peers. So we would hope and work to ensure that innovation is rewarded in any tax system going forward. And we have a pretty balanced manufacturing network. We make about half of our plants are in the US and half are outside the US. So I think we we're probably poised to take advantage of any changes that happen in the tax structure going forward. But there's no doubt that having a competitive sort of base rate for the US relative to our OUS peers is something that's, I think, really important for our industry."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, VP of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead, sir. \nKevin Hern: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q2 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We\u2019re also joined by Sara Smith and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the extent and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-Ks filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  As we transition to our prepared remarks, I\u2019ll remind you that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments.\nDave Ricks : Thanks Kevin. A lot has changed in the world since our last earnings call. Science has continued to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and efforts across the industry to develop treatments and vaccines are progressing rapidly.  While some regions and countries have begun to reopen, COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing in other places. Despite these challenges, Lilly continues to demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness to progress our mission of making medicines for the millions of patients we serve.  I've never been more proud of the company and my 35,000 teammates. This past quarter was unlike any other during my tenure as CEO and currently combating social, economic and public health crises. Economic uncertainty remains as high unemployment persists in many countries.  As expected, our business experience headwinds this quarter, with patients unable to see doctors or access healthcare during periods when the economies were shut down to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and by the dwindling or the unwinding afford buying into Q1 that occurred.  Overall our year-to-date results are strong and indicative of the underlying trends. I'm proud of Lilly\u2019s efforts to ensure patients have access to their medicines. To find creative ways to ensure we advance critical research, and to advance our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19.  We continue to staff our manufacturing facilities around the globe with essential personnel, to ensure there are no disruptions in the supply of medicine, and in recent weeks we resumed activity in the majority of our clinical trials where enrollment had been paused. Resuming in-person promotional activities when it's safe on a country-by-country and on a state-by-state basis in the U.S., and we will continue to use these virtual engagement tools we\u2019ve built to augment in-person promotional activities.  Throughout Q2 we saw a steady increase in customer contacts and medical education touch points as we leveraged new platforms to reach physicians. We continue to see increased interest in volume of virtual interactions from physicians and expect a hybrid model of in-person remote engagement for some time in the U.S. as well as internationally.  We also made good progress this quarter, executing our R&D strategy, launching two new medicines in the U.S., including Retevmo, the first therapy ever approved for patients with RET driven lung and thyroid cancers, and Lyumjeva, a fast acting mealtime insulin for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  Taltz and non-radiographic axSpA, Cyramza in combination with erlotinib for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer and Tauvid, our new diagnostic for patients with Alzheimer's disease who were also approved in the U.S.  Several positive Phase 3 readouts this quarter include Verzenio in adjuvant breast cancer, now the first and the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to succeed in this population. Mirikizumab and psoriasis compared to both placebo and head-to-head versus Cosentyx and just today in collaboration with Boehringer and Jardiance in heart failure patients with reduced injection fraction, both with and without diabetes. We also continue to make progress on our potential COVID-19 therapies. Notably, the initiation of multiple clinical trials developing neutralizing antibodies, both as monotherapy and in combination. Dan will provide you with more detail during the R&D update. The unprecedented pace at which we're executing this project across our development and manufacturing organizations is evidence of what we are capable as an innovative company.  As I mentioned earlier, our Q2 business results were negatively impacted by COVID-19; however, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business. COVID-19 had a meaningful impact on economic activity and we observed the following trends in the U.S. A sharp decline in the number of patient visits to physicians dropping to roughly 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Reduce visits translated into fewer new prescriptions with the peak impact in late April and early May in most therapeutic classes.  A slow return to health care activity through a combination of Telehealth and in-person visit as IQVIA data showed patient visits were back to 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels in June, and new prescriptions slowly beginning to recover although some variation across therapeutic areas. While the outlook for economic activity is uncertain, we remain optimistic that patients, physicians and hospital systems will continue to find ways to ensure patients can access the medicines they need.  Turning to our Q2 results, as expected reduced patient visits and inventory dynamics were both a drag on otherwise solid total prescription trends. Revenue declined 2% compared to Q2, 2019 and we estimated revenue was negatively impacted by the reversal of largely all of the $250 million of stocking related to COVID-19 that we experienced in Q1. While most existing prescriptions were maintained, new patient prescriptions declined in Q2 relative to pre-COVID-19 baselines. We estimate this impact to have been about $250 million across the portfolio.  Taking into account current trends, we are on track to deliver the financial goals we established for 2020. The strength of our new products, our ability to scale them worldwide and our productivity agenda position us well to continue to deliver robust business performance and to create shareholder value.  Moving to slide five, you\u2019ll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. Before, Josh discusses our financial results, just a few comments about the executive orders that were announced last Friday. We all share the goal of making medicines more affordable and accessible to patients and believe concepts such as rebate reform and the sharing of savings within the eligible 340B patient population offer real opportunities to lower the out-of-pocket costs for patients quickly.  However, as I've noted before, the concept of international price indexing is a bad policy. This policy will have almost no benefit to patient out-of-pocket costs, but together with reimportation we\u2019ll most assuredly have serious negative consequences for patients for the safety of our supply chain and for the future of innovation. So now is the wrong time to introduce sweeping government actions that will at best distract and at worse, cripple the same industry that's racing to discover vaccines and treatments to defeat COVID-19.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John to review our Q2 results in more detail and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020. \nJosh Smiley: Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Moving to slide six and seven, our non-GAAP financial performance in 2Q and during the first half of 2020 was impacted by COVID-19 across many lines of the income statement. As Dave mentioned, revenue declined 2% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019. It was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in two ways. First; largely all of the $250 million of COVID related stock in Q1 reversed as excess supply in the channel and in medicine cabinets was consumed and Q2 closing inventory returned to historically normal levels.  Second, reduced patient visits due to COVID-19 resulted in lower new prescriptions across many of our brands, which we estimate had a negative impact on Q2 revenue of approximately $250 million as well. We estimate this impact to be a temporary step down in market size, which we expect will return to pre-COVID levels over the balance of the year, with the pace of recovery varying by therapeutic area.  Given the stocking and destocking seen between quarters, our first half performance of 7% sales growth in constant currency is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 79.6%, a decline of 140 basis points versus Q2, 2019, driven primarily by the negative impact of price, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment.  Moving down the P&L, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 9% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019, as reduced marketing and travel meeting expenses were only partially offset by investment in virtual tactics. Research and development expenses declined 1% as a pause in clinical trials have shifted activity and expenses to the second half of 2020.  In total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half \u2013 sorry, I'm just having a technical issue here. We just had a system problem.  So in total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half of 2020 operating income increased by 14% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth by 500 basis points. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28% during the second quarter and 29.1% for the first half of 2020.  We continue to adapt the way we allocate resources to efficiently the operating environment, where the threat of COVID-19 is likely to be disruptive for a sustained period of time. We are expanding our virtual capabilities to support executing our strategy and are committed to our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31%.  Other income and expense was income of $447 million this quarter compared to an expense of $32 million in Q2, 2019. This quarter\u2019s other income was primarily driven by the increase in value of investments in Asian biopharma companies, as well as previously private companies that went public here in the U.S.  We have investments across a range of private and public biopharma companies as a part of our external innovation strategy and these investments allow us to nurture emerging science and access potential new medicines and novel modalities. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.4%, an increase of 340 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of our earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and a lower net discrete tax benefit than last year. At the bottom line earnings per share increased 26% in Q2 as a sizable gain on public equities more than offset the decline in operating income. During the first half of 2020, earnings per share increased 29%.  On slide eight we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue declined 2% during Q2 as volume growth of 6% was offset by price. Foreign exchange had an additional 1% negative impact on revenue growth. During the first half of 2020 revenue grew 7% in constant currency and volume grew 13% and price declined 7% or 5% excluding the impact Alimta and Tyvyt had in China.  U.S. revenue decline 3% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 4% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality and Verzenio. As mentioned earlier, we saw destocking at the wholesaler and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of negative impact during the quarter. In addition, we estimate reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $150 million.  Pricing was an 8% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, impacted by predominately changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Humalog, which was driven primarily by favorable Medicaid adjustments in the prior period and unfavorable commercial adjustments in the current period. Then to a lesser extent by higher growth across the portfolio and lower net price segment, and increased rebate to maintain our strong commercial access, which was partially offset by reduced copay program utilization for Emgality and Taltz as a function of improved access versus last year. As we previously discussed, our quarterly pricing trends in the U.S. fluctuate based on delayed invoicing from customers, seasonality of copay assistant and our obligations during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D.  Excluding the impact of the onetime Humalog adjustment and focusing on trends that impact our business going forward, we saw an underlying pricing trend of low single digit decline in Q2 versus Q2, 2019 and this is consistent with our current expectation of mid-single digit price decline for the year, with the underlying low single digit net price decline, combined with one-time adjustments in the first half of 2020 and modest effects of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.  During the first half of 2020 U.S. revenue increased 5% versus last year, volume grew 11% and price declined 6%. We are encouraged by the improving demand trends in recent weeks and more normalized shipping trends. As we conclude 2021 U.S. Contracting negotiations, we remain confident in our strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and our ability to maintain this going forward.  Moving on Europe, revenue declined 4% in constant currency as price and volume declined by 2% each. Strong volume growth from Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz was offset by volume declines from Cialis, Forteo, Olumiant, Strattera and Humalog. We estimate European revenue was reduced by approximately $50 million due to COVID-19 related destocking in Q2, and roughly $35 million due to COVID-19 related lower new prescription. Despite fluctuation across quarters, the underlying trends are very strong as Europe posted volume growth of 11% during the first half of 2020 as our new products continue to scale.  In Japan revenue declined by less than 1% in constant currency and 4% volume growth was more than offset by government mandated price decreases effective April 2020. In addition, we estimated reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $35 million. The solid volume growth of Verzenio, Trulicity, Olumiant and Cyramza were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by the increased competition for Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera.  In China, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by 50% volume growth, largely offset by price. Volume and price were both affected by the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medications.  Outside of the oncology portal in China we saw a rebound in new patient initiation and in person customer interaction as the pandemic's impact began to moderate. Our newest lunches, Trulicity, Taltz and Alimta are seeing good uptake in Humalog, Cymbalta are again exhibiting solid growth.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 7% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers. Strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio was partially offset by decreased Cialis volume. Revenue was negatively impacted by COVID related reduced new prescription, by approximately $25 million, which was more than offset by the sale of the legacy product in Asia.  As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered over 12 percentage points to volume growth this quarter. The strong volume growth, volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE products; Forteo and Cialis, as well as reduced [inaudible] royalty from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim that we announced last year. We exit the first half of 2020, pleased with a 16% year-to-date volume growth of our key products that delivered despite a challenging environment.  Slide 10 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total these brands generated nearly $3 billion of revenue this quarter making up 54% of revenue. While 12% volume growth from key products in Q2 is robust, the negative impact on new patient starts from COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 related inventory movement across borders were a drag on growth in the quarter. We put both of these impacts to be transient and we're seeing new-to-brand prescriptions recover in June and July. The underlying business is robust and while COVID-19 has impacted our therapeutic areas differently, our product specific trends within the market backdrop are strong.  In diabetes, Trulicity remains the market leader in the U.S. GLP-1 market with over 45% share of total prescription. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the GLP-1 class were 32% less than pre-COVID-19 levels at one point during Q2, activity is trending in the right direction and now fits at around negative 16% for the week ending July 17. Total prescription trends have slowed some, but we're still robust to the class and grew by 27% in Q2 compared to last year. As the class leader, Trulicity is well positioned for future growth, and we look forward to regulatory action later this year on the higher doses of Trulicity. We expect the potential launch of additional doses to be an important option to allow patients to realize benefits, while extending the duration of therapy on Trulicity.  And another large impact, growing diabetes class Jardiance maintained market leadership in the U.S. SGLT2 class, with over 57% share of total prescription. The SGLT2 class saw a similar magnitude of reductions as the GLP-1 class for new-to-brand prescriptions, as new prescriptions where 38% less than the pre-COVID-19 levels before recovering some in June and July. Current weekly trends are probably 15% below pre-COVID-19 levels.  Jardiance continues to be the catalyst for class growth in new and total prescriptions, growing over 12 percentage points faster than the market in Q2, with 32% growth versus last year. We're excited by the recently announced positive results of Jardiance in patients with heart failure and EMPEROR-Reduced trial and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trail readout in 2021. We estimate the addressable market from each trial is up to $3 million additional patients in the U.S., adding a potential new source of future growth for Jardiance.  In oncology, Verzenio continues to show positive trends in the metastatic setting as U.S. share of the market in new-to-brand prescriptions continued to increase about 20%. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the CDK4/6 class were more than 30% below pre-COVID levels of 1 point in the quarter, Verzenio fared better at negative 19% and the most recent week of new-to-brand prescription is above the pre-COVID-19 average.  Verzenio had positive momentum as the monarchE trail result adds to the compelling existing data package. We look forward to presenting these data at a medical meeting later this year.  Tyvyt, our immuno-oncology product in collaboration with Innovent in China posted another strong quarter of performance and was the biggest driver of China's 50% volume growth in Q2. Tyvyt was added to the national drug reimbursement list in January this year and we anticipate strong sales momentum in the second half of 2020. We expect Tyvyt to continue to be an important driver of growth in China.  Our newest oncology medicine Retevmo had a strong launch despite the viewing during a challenging external environment. We are encouraged by early demand signals and initial customer feedback on the impressive safety and efficacy profile is very positive. Our sales force and medical science liaisons are actively engaging with 6,000 lung and thyroid specialists through virtual tactics, and our existing relationships with this customer base are leading to a high quality interactions and increased brand awareness for this first in class medicine. While still early in the launch, we are excited about the fast start and continue to believe we have the best-in-class products.  In immunology we saw strong new-to-brand trends with Pulse early in Q1, followed by a sizable but more gradual impact of COVID-19. Compared to pre-COVID levels, new-to-brand prescriptions across immunology declined 36%. While this category has also been slower to recover, the most recent weeks have showed improvement in trend. However, new-to-brand prescriptions for the total market are still 21% below pre-COVID levels.  Taltz continues to compete for leadership in Dermatology new-to-brand share of market and rheumatology trends are encouraging, although growing from a smaller base. Total Taltz prescriptions grew 11% in Q2 compared to Q1 and 35% versus Q2 2019. We remain confident that our compelling data package of head-to-head trials and recent approval in non-radiographic axSpA will deliver growth in a competitive field of immunology.  In migraine we've also seen a more prolonged decline in new-to-brand prescriptions due to COVID-19. New-to-brand prescriptions in the injectable CGRP class have been 15% to 20% below pre-COVID levels since late April and through July. Emgality\u2019s share of market remains strong with over 38% of new and total prescriptions within the class.  Although new-to-brand trends have been impacted by COVID-19, class growth for total prescriptions was robust in Q2, increasing 64% compared to last year and 12% versus Q1, 2020. Given the importance of primary care physicians in driving growth, with the return of active promotions from multiple competitors, we expect class growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2020.  Also in migraine or acute therapy REYVOW is significantly impacted by the lack of patient visit and the in-person customer interactions related to COVID-19. While uptake so far has been modest early in the launch, we\u2019ll make investments to drive awareness and focus our promotional efforts in the coming quarters to drive uptake. While the field is competitive, we continue to believe our portfolio of both acute and preventative treatment with two mechanisms of action is a differentiator for our migraine franchise.  On slide 11 we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first half of 2020 we invested over $4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned almost $2 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend.  We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets and do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel and market uncertainty to affect our efforts.  Before we provide an update on our 2020 financial guidance, slide 12 provides an overview of the composition of our U.S. business led by payer segment mix. This is the topic of frequent interest to investors and is permanent [ph] as we monitor the currently high levels of unemployment and the potential for that to negatively impact our business. Based on growth sales during the first half of 2020, within our existing business, commercial plans make up the largest portion at around 40%. Medicare Part D is the second largest segment at approximately 20%, mainly due to our diabetes portfolio. Government and hospital segments make up roughly 15%, Medicaid is around 10%, Medicare Part D is nearly 5% and then non-contracted business uninsured and cash make up the remaining 10%.  So as we continue to monitor and analyze the potential impact of unemployment, causing people to lose their commercial insurance and potentially shift to Medicaid, our modeling suggests this will have a modest impact in 2020 and is contemplated in our financial guidance range.  We expect these trends to have a larger impact in 2021 and the magnitude will be driven by the size and duration of unemployment in the U.S., the quality of commercial or ACA Exchange Insurance plans, displace of employees move from, the majority of our products as newer products have smaller net pricing spread between Medicaid and commercial plan, and government stimulus or relief plans that may keep patients on commercial insurance.  While there is uncertainty on how all these factors will play out, at this time we anticipate increased utilization of Medicaid versus commercial insurance to be a moderate headwind to revenue in 2021 of approximately $200 million. This approximation contemplates peak U.S. unemployment in the low double digits in 2020, a gradual recovery in 2021, to high single digits percent unemployed by year end.  We do not have an estimate on the impact of the executive orders on 2021 at this point, but given the uncertainty around them and our modest exposure to Part B, we expect the near term impact to be limited. Given our view of 2021 pricing negotiations, we still expect mid-single digit price impact across the portfolio in 2021.  So now moving to slide 13, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on the best estimates at this time and similar to how we approach Q1. We are balancing transparency and insight into the current view of the business, with the uncertainty we are all facing surrounding the extend and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include healthcare activity returns to normal levels in the second half of 2020 as doctors utilize Telehealth for in-person visits to see patients despite potential additional COVID-19 outbreaks.  The recovery in new patient prescriptions improved in the U.S. reaching and then growing above pre-COVID-19 levels by Q4 for most brands, noting the trends will differ regionally and by brand; price headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment continue to be modest; clinical trial sites remain open and active in enrolling patients and promotional spend in the second half of the year constitutes a mix of in-person customer interactions, direct to consumer advertising and investment in supporting digital promotion.  While uncertainty remains regarding the continued spread of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that patients and physicians will find ways to access healthcare.  We believe the stocking and destocking activity observed in Q1 and Q2 is largely washed out and we are encouraged by the demand trends and more normal shipping patterns we're seeing with our customers. As a result we're maintaining our revenue range, recognizing additional closures in the healthcare system could cause us to revisit that range later in the year.  Moving down the income statement, we are lowering our gross margin as a parent of revenue to be approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis. This reduction reflects changes in geographic mix and lower realized prices.  We expect our GAAP gross margin to be 78%. We are also lowering our range from marketing, selling and administrative expenses by $200 million to reflect savings from reduced travel meetings and in-person promotional activities, which are all partially offset by investments in digital capabilities. Our range for research and development expenses is unchanged. We expect savings associated with temporary pausing of clinical trial starts and enrolment to catch up in the second half of 2020 as we resumed activity in Q2. Of note, we can see positive data in our neutralizing antibody treatments for COVID-19 that supports product development. We plan to fully invest in registration of clinical trial and further scaling of manufacturing capacity.  Under this scenario our research and development expenses are likely to be on the high end of our range as Lilly is self-funding all of these programs. We believe these investors are important to help combat the impact of the global pandemic.  Our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% remains as a reduction in total operating expenses offset through slightly lower gross margin percentage. We're updating the range for other income and expense the $350 million to $500 million of income, reflecting gains in our equity portfolio as seen in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this number is of course subject to volatility in the capital markets.  Now turning the taxes, we're reducing our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to approximately 14%, driven by the net discrete tax benefits we booked for the first half of the year. So earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.20 per share to $7.40 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.48 per share to $6.68 per share.  Q2 was certainly an atypical quarter. As I highlighted earlier, COVID impacted our financial results in a number of ways. However, our confidence in the strength of our underlying business and our demonstrated ability to overcome challenges gives us the conviction to reaffirm our robust outlook for sales growth and productivity.  So now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q2 and a pipeline update. \nDan Skovronsky: Thanks Josh. Since our last call we\u2019ve had major lifecycle readouts for three of our most important new medicines; Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. All three were positive, all represent clinically meaningful advances for patients and all should help drive continued growth for these important brands. I\u2019ll speak briefly about each, as well as the Phase 3 readout from mirikizumab, a molecule still under development.  In addition to advancing our existing R&D portfolio, we have devoted significant efforts to creating and testing potential therapies for COVID-19 and here too we have made good progress this quarter. Before I go through the pipeline update, I'll provide an update on our COVID-19 therapies.  Moving to slide 14, we provide an overview of the active programs we are pursuing to treat or prevent COVID-19. These programs have moved with unprecedented speed and hopes of finding new medicine to help blunt the impact of the virus.  Baricitinib our JAK inhibitor has two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory activity observed by baricitinib in other diseases is thought to be potentially beneficial in treating COVID-19.  The first trial is investigating baricitinib in combination with remdesivir as part of the NIAID\u2019s Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial and we expect to have data from this trial within the coming months. The second trial is Lilly sponsored and is assisting baricitinib as monotherapy. We expect results from this trial later this year.  Second, we are pursuing a Phase 2 trial of an antibody that targets Angiopoietin 2, which has been observed to be elevated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. Based on trial enrolment we now expect to have data in-house this fall to inform next steps.  While these two efforts may inform treatment of symptoms of COVID-19, the approach I\u2019m most excited about is virus neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, both a single antibody therapies and in combinations. We currently have efforts ongoing with LY-CoV555 which arose from our collaboration with AbCellera and with LY-CoV016 which we licensed from Junshi Biosciences. The development status is summarized on slide 15.  Both the antibodies have completed dosing in their Phase 1 studies with safety and PK results that support advancing the molecules. Neither Phase 1 study was designed to collect efficacy data, that is a 555 trail that only enrolled six patients per dose and O16 enrolled only healthy volunteers. 555 is further along in development and is progressed to a large dose ranging Phase 2 study in ambulatory patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Here we are focused on reducing viral load. The study is enrolling quickly, and we should have data to report by Q4. This will be our first opportunity to share human efficacy data from the neutralizing antibody program.  Based on safety and tolerability data gathered to-date, as well as taking into accounts the gravity of the unmet medical need here, we plan to initiate registrational studies in the coming weeks, even in advance of having efficacy data. We've been in studies across several different patient populations including a Phase 3 study for prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long term care facilities, as well as additional registrational studies for potential treatment indication in both the ambulatory and hospitalized settings. Once underway, the timing for data disclosure from these trials will be highly dependent on patient enrollment and any intern efficacy and safety data we may see.  In addition to the monotherapy trials I describe for 555, we intend to test the combination of O16 with 555, in case such a combination is needed to combat viral resistance. We look forward to producing additional data for both programs and we\u2019ll provide updates as we achieve program milestones or data become available. We continue to invest in manufacturing for these potential therapies at risk and we are focused on ramping up our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible.  While developing treatments for COVID-19 is an important priority for Lilly right now, we also continue to advance the rest of our pipeline, to help people with diabetes, immune disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer.  One particularly exciting development this quarter was the positive interim readout of the MonarchE trial, assessing the use of Verzenio to reduce the risk of recurrence in (HR)-positive, HER2-negative high risk early breast cancer. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to show a benefit in this setting, where another competing product failed at our T-cell analysis.  Our conviction and the differentiation of Verzenio from the competition continues to increase based on important data, including safety and tolerability data and mechanism of action that have allowed for continuous dosing and therefore continues target inhibition. This is a unique feature of abemaciclib.  Clinical efficacy that support use even as a monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer, another unique feature of abemaciclib. The demonstrated benefited overall survival in the metastatic setting in combination with fulvestrant, something not all CDK4/6 inhibitors have been able to show and most recently, positive result in the adjuvant setting, another unique feature of abemaciclib.  These data continue to support our convictions, but not all CDK4/6 inhibitors are the same. The positive results in MonarchE could significantly increase the opportunity for Verzenio. Looking at the MonarchE study clinical pathological criteria for enrolment, we estimate that approximately 20,000 patients in the U.S. would match these criteria. This represents a roughly 50% increase over the current addressable market in metastatic breast cancer.  Our market projected to reach almost $7 billion in 2020. In addition we anticipate duration of therapy in the adjuvant setting will be longer. We plan to submit this data by the end of the year to regulators around the world and to present them at a major medical meeting in 2020.  Moving to slide 17, we also presented important Trulicity data at the virtual ADA and ENDO meetings this summer. In the on-treatment analysis the 3 milligram and 4.5 milligram doses of Trulicity demonstrated statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1C reduction and weight loss versus the currently approved 1.5 milligram dose at 36 weeks.  These doses could allow our patients to receive additional clinical benefits and stay on Trulicity, but still experiencing Trulicity\u2019s ease of use. We look forward to U.S. any EU regulatory action on the additional doses of Trulicity later this year.  At the virtual ADA we also share data which builds upon the existing body of evidence demonstrating the simplicity of the Trulicity patient experience, combined with its powerful efficacy.  In this real world analysis of patients after a minimum of six months of follow-up in the U.S., Trulicity demonstrated significantly higher adherence and persistence compared to two other weekly GLP-1. In addition, significantly fewer people discontinued treatment on Trulicity compared to other agents. This real world evidence complements the robust clinical data generated for Trulicity and provides further support for why Trulicity is the market leading GLP-1.  Moving to slide 18, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of July 23. Movements since our last earnings call includes the previously mentioned U.S. approvals for Lyumjev, Retevmo, and Tauvid. The U.S. approval of Taltz for non-radiographic axSpA and Cyramza for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer, the initiation of the Phase 3 tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT, the advancement of three new Phase 2 programs, the initiation of three Phase 1 programs and the attrition of our first generation KRAS G12C molecule.  While we were excited about our initial KRAS program, we observed unexpected toxicity in the clinic that precluded further development. We are working to understand the mechanistic basis for the toxicity and we are exploring a backup program.  Moving to slide 19, we provided an update on our 2020 key events that occurred during the quarter. In addition to the previously mentioned approvals, initiations and pipe in progress, we submitted Alimta [ph] in the U.S. for atopic dermatitis. As Dave mention earlier, we also announced positive phase 3 read outs for Jardiance in heart failure and mirikizumab in psoriasis. Beginning with Jardiance, we were optimistic about the likelihood of success in heart failure based on compelling CV data seen in diabetic patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We were pleased to see a positive outcome for the first heart failure trial to read out EMPERIAL-Reduced and will present the data in August at the European Society of Cardiology and submit to regulators later this year. We look forward to additional Jardiance data readouts, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the EMPERIAL-Preserved trial in 2021 and the chronic kidney disease, EMPA-KIDNEY study in 2022.  We also noticed a positive readout from mirikizumab phase 3 in psoriasis, including success on the primary and all key secondary endpoints. It's particularly encouraging to see such robust data from mirikizumab in a head-to-head trial, since trial of such disease are the gold standard for comparing agents.  Indeed, we had a number of positive head-to-head trials with Taltz in psoriasis and now we\u2019re pleased to see mirikizumab demonstrate superiority versus percentage at 52 weeks on both about passing 90 and passing 100.  Despite growing a competition is psoriasis, Taltz remains an excellent option for patients that delivers clear skin fast. These new data suggest that mirikizumab also has a consensual to be a meaningful treatment for people living with psoriasis. We look forward to submitting mirikizumab in this indication and importantly, these data further our conviction in IBD, where we see the biggest opportunity.  Given the relative priority of indications, we've been staging our investments in psoriasis. We work on going to prepare for the psoriasis submission and plan to submit in the second half of 2021. Accordingly, we've also provided an updated timeline for the phase 3 data of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. We now expect the topline results production for ulcerative colitis in the spring of 2021 and for Crohn's disease in 2022.  Since we announced the pause of new trial starts and enrollment in many programs back in March, I'm pleased to report that we\u2019ve re-opened enrollment in the vast majority of clinical trial and we are again initiating new trials.  As we partner with clinical trial sites going forward, we made a number of changes to how we run clinical trials that allow for many chances to be completed virtual. These two capabilities have come from necessity, but are also improvements on the way clinical research is conducted and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue going forward.  These are challenging times in drug development, but Lilly has demonstrated we have the creativity to adapt to the new environment and we're committed to bringing new medicines to patients.  Dave, back to you for some closing remarks. \nDave Ricks: Thanks Dan. We\u2019re mobilizing our resources to pursue treatments of devastating diseases is a natural part of our history and our company's purpose, on a separate note I think all major employers are realizing we have a bigger role to play in the fight against systemic racial injustice and as a corporate leader in diversity inclusion, Lilly is committed to using our platform to speak up, speak out and work towards solutions to eliminate the racism and inequities that African-Americans and other minorities have experienced for far too long.  We are stepping up to bring people and organizations together to acknowledge the trauma of racial injustice, understand its many forms and create lasting change. To underscore our commitment to positive action, we also announced a pledge of $25 million and 25,000 employee volunteer hours over the next five years. The funding in volunteerism will be directed toward combating racial injustice and inequality primarily here in Indiana and we plan to partner with other businesses and community groups to achieve our goals.  While there\u2019s nothing easy about the road ahead, we can no longer accept systemic bias in any of its forms and the time for platitudes is now behind us. The time for meaningful actions, specifically by the corporate community to drive lasting change is in fact now, so a busy quarter.  Let me conclude with some closing comments on our progress in the first half of the year. As expected, our business experienced headwinds this quarter based on reduced new patient starts and changes in inventory we highlighted earlier this year. With that in mind, we are pleased that in the first half of 2020 we delivered strong volume driven revenue growth of 7% worldwide in constant currency.  We are cautiously optimistic about the recovery of both healthcare activity and prescription trends and expect both to accelerate during the second half of this year. We continue to find innovative ways to ensure our patients have access to their medicines and that we can support physicians and hospital systems as they provide care.  Our operating margin improved 200 basis points over the first half of 2019 and we made exciting progress on our pipeline this quarter. We saw three top line phase 3 data readouts from important clinical programs. We had five U.S. approvals for NMEs and line extensions and achieved a number of other clinical milestones that Dan just highlighted.  The COVID-19 global pandemic continues to be a disruptive force in the way we all work and live. Lilly and the broader pharmaceutical industry are working hard to develop new medicines to treat and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We anticipate this disruption will continue till vaccines and new medicines can be used to manage the spread of the infection.  While near term challenges do exist, we remain confident in the long term outlook for our company and the strength of our fundamentals. Lilly and Lilly people will continue to rise to the challenge and I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to combat the global health crisis, social and economic crises we currently face.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin who\u2019ll moderate the Q&A session. \nKevin Hern: Thank you, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Kevin, if you can please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now go to the first question and that will be from Seamus Fernandez, Guggenheim. One moment please sir. And sir, now your line is open. \nSeamus Fernandez : Yeah, can you hear me?\nKevin Hern: Yes, yes. \nSeamus Fernandez : Okay, great, thanks. So just a couple of quick questions. You know first for Dan. Dan could you help us understand a little bit more about the timing of your CoV-2 antibody data you know and also just wanted to get a little bit of the scientific discussion around your choice of pursuing a single antibody.  I know that the AbCellera technology is unique, but just wanted to have a little bit more of a discussion around that. I think that would be helpful for investors as we think about the choice of the single antibody. I know you've talked about manufacturing as a driving choice there, but obviously the efficacy is paramount, so we just wanted to get a full understanding of that dynamic and that choice and how you hoped the study is going to read out. And then you know secondly, just as we think about the margin dynamics in the second half of the year, Josh I was just hoping that you could help us better understand the directional trajectory you know of how you're expecting the margins to shape up in the second half. How much of that is driven by meaningful revenue acceleration versus you know just an ability to kind of manage the expense line. Thanks. \nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Seamus. Dan and then Josh. \nA - Dan Skovronsky: Great! Thanks Seamus for those questions about the COVID-19 antibodies. Maybe just starting with timing, you know of course the timing of data disclosures depends on how best trials enroll and what the data show. We're committed to getting important information out to the public and the scientific communities as quickly as it's available. With respect to the phase 2 trial, that is focused on viral load, I think this is going to be the first and probably a key indicator of potential efficacy for this approach, and I commented that we expect to have that data to disclose from this 400 patient phase 2 trial in Q4, but again, that just depends on how best we can enroll these patients.  Your second question there was around the rational for a single antibody versus two or three or cocktails of even more antibiotics have been proposed, and specifically you have to look around efficacy. So I think we and others have looked at monotherapy versus combination therapy in a variety of preclinical models for the disease and looking at neutralization of the virus infection of human cells for example.  And what you\u2019ll find is that combinations don't offer efficacy groups. A single antibody can generally neutralize the virus just as well as combinations of antibody. The reason that people sometimes try combinations of antibodies, because they're worried that over time resistance could emerge. So I don't expect to see any efficacy booster, efficacy denumeration for having a combo or monotherapy in clinical trials.  What we\u2019ll be looking for instead is whether or not there's an emergence of resistance. There are some factors that make that somewhat less likely here. I think the extremely high potency of 555 and its ability to effectively neutralize virus very, very quickly may decrease the risk of resistance. We've done some primary studies and we've not seen resistance emerge in those studies at all. But we'll be watching patients carefully and we have the combination therapy that will move forward as a backup if resistance is seen. The advantages of monotherapy are obvious and you commented on them. It\u2019s simply that if you have one antibody, you can manufacture twice as much as a combo of two antibodies, three times as much as three antibodies. In a situation like this, I think they are just starting a tradeoff that might indicate maximizing manufacturing capacity is the key objective and so that's where we're heading here. Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thank Dan. Josh? \nJosh Smiley : Thanks Seamus. So if we look at our guidance for the year and think about the margin progression in the second half of the year, just a reminder, you know sales on a constant currency basis grew 7% in the first half and our operating income percentage was a little bit over 29%. So to get to the 31% target we have for 2020, we\u2019re obviously going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year, but I think it's pretty straightforward.  When we look at the sales range that we have, you know picking midpoints or wherever you want to pick, we\u2019re looking really at something close to 7% or 8% growth in the second half of the year. So while we expect an acceleration in sort of absolute sales on a half to half basis, it\u2019s not that much of a stretch from where we are. We think a little bit of a pick-up probably in gross margin in basis points and that's just a function of more normalized geographic impact. As you know we saw more of an impact in the U.S. in the first half of the year than outside the U.S. We expect those things to normalize a little bit in the second half of the year and we\u2019re not anticipating any one-time pricing impact either up or down, so we see a little bit of a benefit there. But the big piece will come on the OpEx side. I mean it's not from additional sort of cost saving moves, you know our guidance range we provide for getting and picking wherever you want to pick in that range, a couple $100 million or so increased investment in absolute dollars in combination of SG&A and R&D in the second half of the year.  So it's really just the absolute sales benefit that we'll see in the second half against a lower absolute increase, but still an increase in OpEx. That gets us to something over 31% in the second half of the year. Put that together and that puts us at 31, because most of these things are certainly in our control.  As I mentioned earlier, and as Dan\u2019s talked about on COVID, we're going to invest fully you know behind those opportunities that is contemplated in our guidance range and to the extent we\u2019re higher on OpEx, you know at the higher end of the range, it\u2019s going to be the \u2013 primarily be because of you know seeing good data and continue to move fast there, but we\u2019re confident in the margin expansion opportunity into the second half of the year for the reasons I just mentioned. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Josh. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Kevin, next caller please.\nOperator: And that will be from the line of Geoff Meacham, Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Questions, I just had a few. On Verzenio I know we have yet to see data details, but can you speak to the real world duration of therapy today in metastatic and then what you would expect from the monarchE setting.  And then a quick drug pricing question for Dave. I know obviously you spent a lot of time on these issues, but you know what are the hurdles to getting IPI implemented and when you look across the Lily portfolio, can you speak to the category that may be more impacted from the executive order, other IPI rebates, etc. Thank you. \nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Geoff. We\u2019ll go Anne for the question on Verzenio and then Dave on IPI. \nAnne White: Well Geoff, thanks for the question on Verzenio and the duration question is an important one and something that we're really excited about as part of the additional opportunity in EBC, and so we do expect the duration of treatment to be longer than the metastatic setting. And to your question, what we've seen in the RWE in the metastatic setting is about eight months.  Now we\u2019ll need to see what that actually is once the patients are being treated upon approval in the adjuvant setting, but obviously we're encouraged. The fact is the treatment duration in the study itself was 24 months. So we do expect it to be much longer than the eight months that we see in the metastatic setting. \nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Dave?\nDave Ricks: Yeah, thanks Geoff. Well, I mean you know we all observed last Friday's announcements. I think mostly these are not perceiving new ideas, so my statement\u2019s maybe a repeat from prior calls. But on IPI specifically, you know this is being proposed under the CMMI model, Affordable Care Act, so that by itself is probably a problem. It just seems to regulate the entirety of the U.S. position infused market via that mechanism, and you know you expect the industry to vigorously challenge that authority here as to create new authority.  But if implemented, and we have yet to see the tax by the way. I'm not sure the White House has put that out yet, but let's assume it's something like the 2018, a blueprint proposal. We are relatively under exposed to this idea, because it affects part B physician infused drugs. Today you know the two material medicines fit that in our portfolio, Alimta and Cyramza. Of course Alimta, we expect a patent expiry in spring of \u201922, so you have a time window impact that\u2019s quite short. And Cyramza, which is obviously longer and a meaningful product, but a part of our growth story but not a cornerstone of it. Going forward, of course if we looked at future medicines in the pipeline, there are you know infused medicines in immunology and notably in Alzheimer's should those succeed that you know you'd be concerned about. But I think drug companies have more ability to navigate on future products than they do one past \u2013 products launches in the past, because you can affect your primarily European pricing outlook, perhaps with constrained demand in Europe, but focused on a common floor price for the U.S., so you know we can navigate it.  That said, it's a horrible policy and I think we'll \u2013 it sends a wrong message at a time when this industry is working literally day and night to help us all escape from COVID-19. Do we really want to be talking about this disruptive force and the most well capitalized companies that are least affected, biotech which you know we're not part of that small company group, but they will be severely affected and investor interest in many of their companies could drop precipitously. I think that would be a real loss for what is an industry that's basically U.S. based. So we'll fight it hard and hopefully it won\u2019t come to be.  On rebate, again this is an idea we've pursued before for some time, as well as frankly you know we're not disappointed by the 340B pass through idea that was presented as well. We think that the patients who drive the volume, that plans negotiate discounts on should benefit from those discounts.  Frankly as they do in every other part of the healthcare system except medicines, so that we think cost sharing and copay should be based on net price not list and these ideas for that. Again, lots of barriers to implementation on those as well, as your other groups who oppose them, but we\u2019ll continue to support that concept of sharing the savings. \nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Dave. Geoff, thanks for your questions and next caller please?\nOperator: Tim Anderson, Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTim Anderson: I have a commercial question on CDK 4/6 class. So Pfizer\u2019s hyperensive market leader, but it is the only CDK 4/6 that failed to show survival benefit informal phase 3 trials in metastatic, of course the fail in adjuvant. Did Lilly think that the metastatic share Brent [ph] has is materially at risk. The competitors like Verzenio where realistically the stickiness to the segment either said that its real world studies that show an OS benefit well protected, but wondering what your view is? So it\u2019s really a question on the metastatic segment. But then on to Tirzepatide, how would you characterize your level of confidence that the first upcoming phase 3 results, were going to be data that really wows investors, like the phase 2 trial results did. Its notable that the analysts already carry about a $5 billion estimate for Tirzepatide in a consensus model. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Tim. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on the CDK 4/6 class and then Mike Mason for the question on Tirzepatide. \nAnne White: Well, thanks for the question Tim on Verzenio and we believe we've seen really positive trends will Verzenio in the metastatic setting and I think josh mentioned those in some of the intro, and we\u2019ve really capitalized on the positive overall survival data from one or two in the combination with that strength. And so we\u2019ve seen versus Q2 2019 is worldwide growth of 56% in revenue and U.S. growth is 35%.  And then if we looked globally, we now had 49 approvals worldwide and I think probably an important metric is the Japan NBRx share of the market now, it's 58%. So we\u2019re seeing a very strong launch in Japan, and so we believe obviously that with specifically significant survival data, that's really the gold standard in this class and so we believe that more and more physicians will be trying Verzenio and we\u2019ve seen that in the continued increase in the NBRx and so we'll continue to share that message.  We believe that this is the best-in-class agent and I think it just goes to that whole picture of the differentiation that we see with Verzenio over time and I just think that that will shift physicians\u2019 minds.  Mark has the results from monarchE as Dan mentioned, really do differentiate it from both CDK 4/6 and then we've got the statistically significant results, not just in the overall population, but then in the hard to treat population, those with visceral disease and primary endocrine resistant. And again, you didn't see that with some of the other CDK 4/6\u2019s.  So I think we\u2019re starting to feel pretty strongly and I think physicians are starting to agree with us that we have a differentiated agent here, and so you\u2019ll continue to see us press in the metastatic setting, because we have that survival data, and now we get to make the move into the other trend setting. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Mike?\nMike Mason: Okay, for tirzepatide we\u2019re glad to see that your wowed by our phase 2 data and for patients struggling with type 2 diabetes. You know I think the best thing to really do is to go back and take a look at the phase 2 clinical studies. I mean we saw at the 50 milligram dose up to 2.4% A1C reduction and weight loss up to 12.7% versus placebo in just six months of starting. So we're excited to see how tirzepatide can perform in this patient population and longer studies in phase 3.  There's nothing to tell us that we won't see you know exciting data coming out of the phase 3, we don't have any new information that suggests otherwise, so we are incredibly confident about tirzepatide, not only in type 2 diabetes, but also we're excited to see its potential in Nash [ph] and obesity. So our enthusiasm remains very, very high. Thank you for the question. \nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Mike. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: And that\u2019s Umer Raffat, Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Thanks so much for taking my question. Dan, I'm just trying to reconcile the positive commentary around your COVID map heading to registrational trials. First is perhaps lack of any data, efficacy data visibility for phase 1 and if you could possibly speak to any trend that you've seen already, that'll be really helpful. And then on KRAS, I might have missed it, but if you could just add some more color on whether you ran into a therapeutic index challenge before efficacy kicked in and if you could speak to what's the highest dose you actually dosed patients with on your KRAS, because it seems like other KRAS users didn't really have any efficacy until a very high dose and all of it kicked in at a certain dose, so it will be really helpful. Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Umer. Dan, you\u2019ll take both of those?\nDan Skovronsky: Yeah, sure. Umer, thanks for both those questions. So on the COVID map, you should be asking about the rational going into registrational studies without having seen efficacy data; its not something we usually do. You're right, of course here it\u2019s \u2013 as I said the gravity of the situation and then look at it with which we desire to test these therapies, that have driven us to that decision. You asked about sort of trends that might have encouraged us from the phase 1 study and unfortunately the answer is we don't have anything to talk about. We had one phase 1 study that was with healthy volunteers, so that they didn't have COVID-19, nothing was due there. The other was so small and in the hospitalized patients six patients per dose group and I think what we saw there is basically what you would expect across doses and placebo.  All of the patients actually did really well and got better and left the hospital. That's not atypical for a phase 1 study here that populations of physicians typically pulled into those studies are some of the better patients who might be at the end of their disease course. I wouldn't expect antibodies in any case to have much effect in people whose viral load is already low and their immune system is already clearing the disease, so that's where we are.  I think the phase 2 study on the other hand is patients who are early in the disease course. They are just within a few days of getting diagnosed. My expectations go up high and in many cases the increasing viral loads in the absence of therapy and it goes here to show that the therapy decreases the viral loads. So that's important read out, but as I said, we\u2019ll have started the phase 3\u2019s by then. On KRAS, this is an issue of off target toxicity, so it's not related to it. The KRAS target itself is our view, that does therefore killed the therapeutic index and not possible to proceed with that drug. I don't think we at this moment could give details on the exact nature of the toxicity or the highest dose that we tested, but we did feel we could proceed based on the doses at which we saw that tox and we're trying to resolve that in the backup program, make some preclinical models for the toxicity and take care of it now. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dan. Umar, thanks for your questions. Next caller please?\nOperator: Andrew Baum of Citi, please go ahead. Mr. Baum, your line is open now.\nAndrew Baum: Hello! Can you hear me?\nKevin Hern: Yes.\nAndrew Baum: A question on U.S. drug price reform. There are a number of life oppositions. Obviously the effect of order referencing paper form, which obviously Lilly has supported, but it requires a positive CEO score in order to move forward.  The first question is, do you think there's any possibility that could be achieved given the history of the CEO score the belief required of an overall reduction in pricing through market based competitions to get there and the CEOs reflect that, so that's number one. And number two, an alternate proposition has got bipartisan support in the Senate, but is stopping from reaching the Senate floor by O\u2019Connell. I know you have some concerns over that bill, but as a potential way forward to mitigate a more deleterious solution on either of the potential options going forward. Can you see this progressing? Many thanks.\nA - Kevin Hern: Thanks Andrew. We\u2019ll go to Dave for both of those.\nDave Ricks : Yeah, thanks Andrew. On the EOs you\u2019re talking about read every form and the pass through and the history here is as you pointed out, the CEO score was extremely negative. In our math largely driven by the one assumption you noted, which is that rebate value which essentially grew back to manufacturers and thus raised premiums. It's a deeply flawed assumption. Of course we\u2019ll compete, but the whole idea would be to move the basis competition from sort of discriminated prices that are private to list price or other means to deliver pricing directly to consumers discounts that pass through for instance.  So that of course requires industry actors to change their practices and that's not something that can be coordinated or messaged very well due to the antitrust laws. So we're sort of in this catch 22 on committing to deliver on sharing the savings, but not being able to do that publicly.  I think that's a problem. I mean it\u2019s particularly a problem for legislation. Of course the executive order method has other problems in terms of legal power, but if enacted under administrative rules, you know there isn't necessarily a requirement to square the budget, so savings can be assumed in other ways and there's a different authority doing the math. That said, I think there are headwinds on this point, both within the administrative executive branch, as well as on the hill. Nonetheless it's the right thing to do and I think we need to continue to push for ways that everyone would have confidence that the industry would compete in a way that would lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. I can tell you that's the goal when we advocate for this policy, and we need to find ways to provide that assurance I think to get movement. You talked about Senate finance and Grassley reintroduced a version of his bill to try to make one last push. I believe his chairmanship is ending in any case at the end of this Congress, so it's understandable why he's doing that. I don't think that that package has much of a chance to advance. There are always ways stars get align and there\u2019s a number of health extenders do at the end of this Congress, but it's a pretty big piece of legislation to throw on an extenders package. The only possible way is that it does produce a positive budget impact in terms of use to pay for other things, but probably you don\u2019t need the whole package.  So I think that's still a narrow path and the most likely scenario is that these EOs can't take the force and don\u2019t take force prior to a new presidential term, a new congression, Congress sitting and the Senate finance doesn't go anywhere either nor does HR3. I think that's sort of a probable planning scenario. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dave. Andrew thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: That will be from the line of Louise Chen of Cantor. Please go ahead. \nLouise Chen : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is, is there any way to quantify the operating margins, what we would have seen in the first half \u201820 without R&D COVID spending and also headwinds of sales from the pandemic? And the second question I had was, how do you think about tirzepatide as a single solution for diabetes, NASH and obesity. Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Louise. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Mike for the second one. \nJosh Smiley : Thanks Louise. I think in the first half as I mentioned, our operating margin was 29.1%. I think if you add back some of the lost prescriptions, but then also keep in mind we had some savings associated with promotions, you know we\u2019re probably closer to 30%. We said as we came into the year, we expected margin expansion through the year. So that\u2019s still on track, but yeah we\u2019re probably off by somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points or something there. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Josh. Mike?\nMike Mason: It\u2019s a great question on tirzepatide and I think we have a, just a phenomenal opportunity to not just be able to provide glucose control for those living with Type 2 Diabetes, but really affect their overall metabolic health. And so I think the contributions of both GLP and GIP can provide the opportunity to really provide improved metabolic health across Type 2 Diabetes, obesity and NASH that are related.  And so it's a great question and I think it's a good opportunity for us to expand our focus beyond just helping someone living with Type 2 diabetes, better control their glucose. So a great question and obviously an area that that we will focus on. There will be people living with Type 2 diabetes that are in our NASH and obesity studies. \nDave Ricks: Maybe just add to that, it goes maybe without saying, to help say it, the current utilization of GLPs in the total diabetes population in developed markets is something like one in eight or one it 10 patients. And so the hope here is that we can rearrange the priorities and the sequence of treatment in a way where this powerful category in here are duel acting GLP, GIP could be used earlier and more broadly to manage disease outcomes in a very different way. Today Type 2 diabetes disease is a failure and perhaps this technology could help doctors and patients find success much earlier in the disease course. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike, Davis. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: Terence Flynn of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nTerence Flynn: Great! Thanks for taking the questions. Was wondering on another one of Verzenio, if the MonarchE date is going to be an ESMO or Antonio Breast, and if you think penetration in the adjuvant setting will be higher, lower or the same as in the metastatic setting over time.  And then Josh, just on contract when you talked about how those discussions are wrapping up now. Anything notable in terms of Trulicity or Taltz that we should consider as we think about those contracts for 2021. Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Terence, we\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on MonarchE and then Josh around the contracting. \nAnne White: Yeah, so thanks for the question Terence. So on the presentation we will be presenting at a medical meeting later this year. Unfortunately I can't confirm which one yet, but we will be presenting at the meeting this year. As far as on the penetration, well that\u2019s I think what\u2019s exciting about this opportunity, is that we are the only CDK 4/6 to have positive results in the adjuvant setting. And so I think our penetration for the high risk patients, which is the population that we had in MonarchE will be extremely high.  So as we\u2019re hearing people ramp even to the top line opportunity, we're seeing that there's a lot of enthusiasm for having CDK 4/6 this setting, and so we look forward to sharing those results as I said later this year. Again, we see I think Dan and others mentioned in the introduction, we see this as an opportunity of only about 20,000 patients here in the U.S., as we matched our criteria in the study to the Sierra database.  So I think we see a pretty significant opportunity. It's really probably half again of what we have in the metastatic setting, which has been significant. So to answer your question, we do expect strong penetration in this space over time. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Josh? \nJosh Smiley: As you know Terence, we won't sort of talk specifically about individual contracts or anything at this point. But I think from what we have seen, first to go back to the earlier comments, we see a pretty similar pricing environment in 2021 to what we're seeing here, which would be modest net price decline, meeting we are providing slightly more rebates than what we're anticipating in terms of list price increases and then we couple that with the other dynamic factors that we mentioned.  I think if you think about Trulicity, we've said sort of you know expect something plus or minutes 5% net price declined over time. I think that\u2019s how we\u2019re viewing next year. It\u2019s a very competitive environment of course that we are focused on maintaining access, not looking to trade price per share or anything like that. So I think those negotiations are going as expected.  With Taltz, we\u2019ve been focus on upgrading our access and so to the extent that were able to do that, you'll see that as a net price decline potentially but compensated for by increased access. Again I think we're happy with the progress we're making this year and continue to focus on improving where we can for next year. But overall, again I\u2019d say the general trend is we have fierce competition in the classes we\u2019re in, but we're focused on maintaining at least the access we have today and you know when we have the chance upgrading in areas like immunology.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Josh. Terence thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: Next will be Chris Schott, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott : Great! Thanks so much for the questions. Just maybe first on Verzenio, you highlighted 20,000 patients potentially in the US. Maybe just give us similar metrics about how you're thinking about the size of the eligible population in developed ex-U.S. markets?  And then second question, very helpful color in terms of kind of a mix of unemployment headwinds for 2021. Any updates in terms of how you're thinking about potential international price pressures from some of the budget deficits we are seeing globally? Is that a \u201821 headwind to think about as well or is that going to take a little bit longer to manifest itself? Thanks so much. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Chris. We\u2019ll got to Anne for Verzenio and then to Dave on the international question. \nAnne White: Great! So thanks so much for that question on the Verzenio eligible population. So as I said in the U.S. about 20,000 eligible patients, which is about 10% to 15% of the HR positive, HER2- EBC positive. Outside the U.S. the pathology is similar and we estimated. So we estimated patient numbers in Europe about 10% larger than the U.S. and then Japan is about one-fourth of the side of the U.S. So I hope that answers the estimate questions outside the U.S. \nDave Ricks : Great! And on international pricing, I think we\u2019ve talked about this before, but we don't have that many proxies for this kind of situation, but what we do know is economic activity, particularly in Europe and Japan has fallen like in the U.S. Tax receipts accordingly and if we use 2008 as a proxy, really took almost three years for the policy implications of that to show up in drug pricing health budgets. I think that\u2019s natural because there's a lag in tax receipts and then there's a lag in policy making in response to it.  I would expect that to happen, and the normal things that occur are clawback mechanisms and methods to keep the medicines budget within some proportion of the health budget. I think that will be a headwind the industrial will face over the next two or three years.  I would say though that, if history follows, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, because Europeans in particular were successful at capping drugs, spending growth in the early part of the last decade. The burden of that tends to follow \u2013 fall disproportionately on older products that are scaled and perhaps with more competition in the categories, whereas as newer products I think actually weren\u2019t really affected. They are more driven by helping technology assessment and the procedures to get an initial price and they don't really drive much budget pressure versus end of life.  As you know, we continually advocate for more biosimilar and generic adoption in these markets is the first lever to pull and so I think also for products they are supposed to buy similar in generics you probably would see more pressure on the back end of this as well. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Crist, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead. \nVamil Divan: Great. Thank you and thanks for taking the question, so a couple if I can. So one, just on the margin discussion and specifically on SG&A, I was wondering if you have any comments you can share just in terms of your more virtual promotional efforts here the past few months, and a sense of how productive they\u2019ve been and we\u2019re just trying to get a sense as you think about going forward, is your spending in SG&A going to be less than what you are thinking before you go to more of a hybrid model, what you expect within a year or so, your SG&A spending would be essentially; would have been before the pandemic?  And then the second one is just maybe more on the business development side, just given some of the volatility you are seeing, [inaudible] COVID and also drug pricing. Do you have change as to how you\u2019re thinking about potential licensing or acquisitions in terms of size and also curious in terms of therapeutic areas, are there any sort of areas where you feel like more need or desire or capacity to bring in additional assets. Thanks so much. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Vamil. We\u2019ll go to Dave for your first question, and then Josh for the second on BD. \nDave Ricks : Yeah Vamil, for some now we've been on a journey to build out the capabilities to reach customers where they want to be reached and have relevant information at that time, as well as around launches and key data readouts to be able to expand our capacity beyond just the sales channel to reach customers.  That has proven pretty useful through this pandemic and I would say overall the conditions which as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are variable around the world in terms of being able to safely send reps in the field and actually even be able to be let into medical buildings and facilities. I think there's a constraint there. So we\u2019ve leaned into this, we've accelerated some of the plans we had to increase volume and the richness of this capability.  Overall, I think the results are \u2013 I think we prefer to run the hybrid model everywhere where we have sales reps and these capabilities, where we can't send sales reps these capabilities have been useful. Is it as productive? I think it's certainly more efficient and it's more scalable. Whether it's as impactful, I think we\u2019ll need to watch through time. We have different markets we serve and I can say that in specialty markets where you get a smaller number physicians and you can target your efforts extremely well. We mention Retevmo launch on this call, which is a kind of a first thing for us was an approval and launch during the pandemic. I think we are pretty pleased with the progress there.  On the other hand, primary care brands, you know it's a little more challenging, because the way these practices are run and the variability and physicians accessibility. So I think the whole industry is probably learning this, but on the other side of this we\u2019ll have a much more enhanced capability and you can bet we are spending huge amounts of time on a global basis lifting that up now in a way that's a pretty rigorous. So you know more to come there. Productivity to be seen, efficiency yes, effectiveness, you know we probably see a lot of variability right now. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dave, Josh? \nJosh Smiley: Yes, so on business development our strategy hasn\u2019t changed. We continue to focus on acquiring potential first-in-class or best-in-class projects or products in our therapeutic areas. There's a high bar there and we've had great progress in our internal pipeline, but we remain committed to finding those kind of opportunities.  We have \u2013 you know we are generating very strong cash flow. We got good investment grade ratings and good liquidity, good access to capital markets. So even with all the disruption related to COVID, I don't see any change for us and then our ability to interact with you know smaller companies or access potential projects hadn't changed. That\u2019s not impacted by COVID. So it's really just a function of finding the right opportunities and ensuring that we can structure the deal in ways that create value for both sides and will continue to focus on that. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Josh. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: Next is Carter Gould of Barclays. Please go ahead. \nCarter Gould: Hi! Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two for Dan. First, on the baricitinib studies in COVID, can you maybe just sort of frame sort how are you thinking about the study, your level of confidence in light of some of the other agents repurposed from RA that had failed, albeit a 3 month JAK inhibition. And then as far as on the N3pG antibody side, are sort of timelines still in intact? Should we still expect the data readout early next year and any commentary on how you're thinking about the hurdle? Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Carter. Dan? \nDan Skovronsky : Yeah sure, thanks. On baricitinib, of course we're encouraged and the reason we did this trials is based on preclinical data around the mechanism of action of baricitinib and I think the clinical effects of the immune-modulating in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been next as you pointed out, but the [inaudible] have also been some promising efficacy signals and even success, so of course with dexamethasone.  So I think we just have to wait and see how this works. Treating patients in a hospitalized setting is important. If we can reduce like the stay or decrease mortality, that will be an exciting result and maybe a stopgap measure until we have the medicines that actually can fight off the virus. So like I hope the neutralizing antibodies will.  As for N3pG, yeah, we are still on the same timeline as we've always been. The trial will wrap up at the very end of this year, which means we'll have data internally and likely some kind of top line, just in the very start of next year. I think given that the size of the study, we have a reasonably high furlough rate and we are hoping to see a large effect size. We base that belief on the level of plaque clearingwe can get.We can get deeper and faster plaque clearance than has been shown with any other agent. So if clearing plaque is important stopping disease progression, we should have a strong effect.  It's noteworthy that we also designed this trial to select a very careful patient population based on the entire levels at baseline, so we also expect smaller standard deviation, because the population should have a more uniform progression. I\u2019d also note that we started the second trial N3pG already. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dan. Carter, thanks for the questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: Next, Steve Scala of Cowen. Please go ahead. \nSteve Scala: Thank you. When we see the data from monarchE, can you reassure us that the disease free survival improvement won't be an underwhelming 1% to 2%. Really seems excited about the data, so I would assume it's going to be stronger than 1% to 2%, maybe 3%, 4%, 5%. And then secondly, Roche announced last week that it will have data from a large Phase 2 trial of a TAURIEL antibody very soon. Should the Roche study fail, can you highlight any differences between the Lilly and Roche molecules and/or the study design that could sustain optimism for the Lilly program or if the Roche molecules sales should reassume that the Lilly molecule likely will follow a similar fate? Thank you. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Steve. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question on monarchE and then Dan for the question on TAURIEL. \nAnne White: Well Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously we just shared the top line at this time, so I can't go into detailed data as you know, part of the data disclosure. But what I can tell you is that we do believe that the possible results from monarchE are clinically meaningful and will add to the existing body of evidence that\u2019s presenting, differentiated from other CDK 4/6s, and this is a major milestone for presenting you know and we believe does have the potential to change the paradigm of how early breast cancer is treated. So we really look forward to sharing the data with you at a meeting later this year. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Dan? \nDan Skovronsky: Yeah, thanks and with respect to TAURIEL antibody, again here, I just say we\u2019re still on track for the data readout. This will come in the second half of the next year. I'm excited about this mechanism, but we don't have clinical data yet. The Roche readout will be important and we\u2019ll be watching it carefully and of course on behalf of patients and the mechanism we\u2019ll be hoping for their success.  But there are some differences as you pointed out, both in molecule and trial design that make read through more complicated. One I think important aspect of molecule design is that there's lots of different species of tau in the brain. There\u2019s a lot of soluble Tau that is monomeric and probably not involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease that can sop up antibody and sort of reduce the effective amount of antibody available to get the bad kinds of tau.  Our antibodies are designed specifically to bind the aggregated tau. So we think that should improve its ability to actually hit the target. Very high doses of these antibodies are generally used to overcome this soluble monomeric tau problem. So that's one difference between that Roche antibody and in fact all of the competitors and ours.  The second difference is there are on trial design and here again, we use our unique expertise in tau imaging and biomarkers to select a patient population that we think (a) will be more uniformity in its disease progression [inaudible] better and (b) be more likely to be responsive to Tau therapeutic. It\u2019s like these therapies will be effective \u2013 they are effective at stopping the spread of tau rather than removing pre-formed Tau and so I think it's important to have patients who are in the midst of the spreading tau, not patients that tau has spread throughout the entire brain. So we'll watch them carefully, but they'll be cautious on read through. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dan. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller please. \nOperator: Navin Jacob, UBS. Please go ahead. \nNavin Jacob: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on some launch products. We talked about some baricitinib. Just wondering how that launch is going. What is the diagnosis rate for RET right now and where do you see that will reach over the next one to two years.  And then, just time lines for Retevmo in ex-U.S. markets. And then separately with regards to your migraine franchise, just want to get some color how you view the CGRP market growing from here going forward, as well as tied to that Lyumjev, I know it\u2019s still early in the launch, but the launch does seem to be a little bit slower than some of the competitors out there. Just wondering what the dynamics that you're seeing in understanding that COVID-19 is also making things a little bit challenging in the neurology setting. Thank you so much. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Navin. We\u2019ll go to Anne for the question of Retevmo then Patrick on migraine. \nAnne White: Well, thanks Navin for the questions on Retevmo. So the launch is going well as Dave mentioned in his introduction and so we're encouraged by the early demand signals that we've seen with Retevmo, and his customer feedback on the data has been very positive. So they're impressed by the efficacy and safety data across multiple indications and lines of therapy that we're able to get into the label, and it\u2019s the largest obviously RET inhibition population that's been studied in 700 patients.  We don't have Rx data to report yet, but we're aware of patient starts in a number of our top accounts, which is supported by the downstream channel orders. So it's clear that our first to market advantage is resulting in the treatment of patients who have identified even in previous testing. So that kind of leads to your question around diagnostic testing.  So what we've seen historically is that RET is showing up on panels probably about 30% of the time. So you\u2019ve hit on one of the key criteria\u2019s of the launch is to continue to drive that testing right up and so it's been very much a focus of our efforts, both to work with the pathologist out in the U.S. on making sure that they have RET on their panels now. We have a very actionable biomarkers for them to test against.  Our goal is essentially to eventually see testing rates like we see in some of the other targeted therapies, which approach 80%. Now the question that we\u2019ll all have to assess is how quickly we can get there, but our goal is to drive that up as quickly as we possibly can, and so that's a big focus of the launch.  And we have a partnership with Thermo Fisher and Illumina and other things in the works to really drive that up across the industry. Because we do believe that that's actually the best care for patients regardless they were treated with Retevmo or other targeted therapies that we want patients to get the right therapy for them.  As far as the time lines, so as you know we've submitted in Europe and so we are waiting regulatory action there. That submission was accepted at the beginning of this year, and then we looked to submit in Japan and China either late this year or early next, so still working with regulatory authorities there. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Patrick. \nPatrick Jonsson : Hey, thank you very much. Well the overall CGRP market continues to grow very nicely and when we look at from the market growth, year-over-year, we are about the growth of 64%, plus this last year.  While in Emgality he actually continues to significantly out-perform the market with growth of 151%. And even if you look at the last quarter, we see that CGRP market continued to grow with 12% despite the significant decline in terms of new-to-brand. And we continue to remain very confident in the future of Emgality and aiming for a market leadership in the preventive market and we see also strong market leadership, I think that in primary care where we have expanded our effort in 2020 and with quite a few new trail. So very, very optimistic in terms of the CGRP market for Emgality.  If we look from the Retevmo launch, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we are not pleased with the performance so far, but we need to have in mind that we had approximately one month in the market place prior to we were hit by COVID-19 and we made the conscious decision to actually pull back from our promotional efforts, both in the field, as well as in terms of seasoning promotional growth.  We have started to start-up virtual proactive detailing and we remain very confidence in the molecule taking into account that it\u2019s the only one, but actually can offer a strong relief from the most painful physical symptoms, as well as the most problems in symptoms associated with the migraine, and we know there is a huge opportunity. Out of the 6 million people being treated in the U.S. today, 35% to 40% of those are not responding to the treatment, and in terms of efficacy really, with one single dose we believe we have the unique value proposition, but still work to be done, lot of work to be done. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Patrick. Navin, thanks for your question. I think we have time for one more caller please. \nOperator: And that\u2019s from the line of David Risinger, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDavid Risinger: Thanks very much. So I have two questions please. First for Dan. If you could just help us understand a little bit better regarding the AbCellera antibody 400 patient Phase 2 which was initiated mid-June. Just curious, given the primary endpoint is that day-11, why would results not be revealed until the fourth quarter.  And then second for Josh, could you comment on the swings in other income. I guess it's really more on a go forward basis that you already discussed what happened in the second quarter just to maybe provide any modeling suggestions to us for modeling other income in future quarters? Thanks very much. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dave. We'll go to Dan and then Josh.\nDan Skovronsky: Yeah Dave, thanks for the question on the timing of the Phase 2. Your right, it\u2019s a 400 patient study that initiated last month. It got up to a bit of a slow start. I think as we at that time, in the country the pandemic shifted in geographies, we shifted our efforts accordingly. It's now enrolling very, very quickly.  The timing of data disclosure depends on that rate of enrollment though. So it could in fact be sooner than Q4. I think I'm confident it will be by of course sometime during Q4 at the latest. As you point out, the day-11 time point is a critical point. So 400 patients enrolled and then 11 days later, need differential swabs and a viral assessment and then database lock and then analysis and reporting, all-in-all it\u2019ll just take probably a couple of weeks from the end of the study. So we'll keep investors updated and the community updated on the progress of the study. That's where we are today. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Dan. Josh? \nJosh Smiley: Thanks. On our OID, of course in the first half of the year and particular in the second quarter as I mentioned, what we're seeing there is the mark-to-market gains from the roughly $2 billion of investment securities we hold. Again, we hold these as a function of business development deals and venture capital deals to stay abreast of breaking science and obviously making good decisions there, at least as of Q2.  We don't anticipate or we don\u2019t forecast gains going forward there. So really, if you keep that neutral Dave, what we are really thinking about then is, we are in a net debt position, so we pay interest costs on the debt and then that\u2019s the only way we see anything that\u2019s positive is if we see investment gains change.  So I think for modeling purposes, look at our sort of net debt position. We've got great rates again the debt and so it\u2019s pretty modest negative cost. But that's sort of what we assume and then you know any unusual items that flow through there, of course we\u2019ll report and we tend to just as you saw in Q2 let those upload though. But we are not anticipating anything significant in the second half of the year. So mostly you're just going to see the negative impacts of our net-debt position. \nKevin Hern: Thanks Josh, David. Thanks for your questions and now we\u2019ll go to Dave for the close. \nDave Ricks: Thanks Kevin. Well, we appreciate your participation in our earnings call today and a remarkable quarter and thank you for your interest in Eli Lilly.  Please follow-up with our IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn\u2019t address today and hope everyone stays well. We\u2019ll talk to you soon. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a good day!",

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks Kevin. A lot has changed in the world since our last earnings call. Science has continued to advance our understanding of COVID-19 and efforts across the industry to develop treatments and vaccines are progressing rapidly.  While some regions and countries have begun to reopen, COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing in other places. Despite these challenges, Lilly continues to demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness to progress our mission of making medicines for the millions of patients we serve.  I've never been more proud of the company and my 35,000 teammates. This past quarter was unlike any other during my tenure as CEO and currently combating social, economic and public health crises. Economic uncertainty remains as high unemployment persists in many countries.  As expected, our business experience headwinds this quarter, with patients unable to see doctors or access healthcare during periods when the economies were shut down to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and by the dwindling or the unwinding afford buying into Q1 that occurred.  Overall our year-to-date results are strong and indicative of the underlying trends. I'm proud of Lilly's efforts to ensure patients have access to their medicines. To find creative ways to ensure we advance critical research, and to advance our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19.  We continue to staff our manufacturing facilities around the globe with essential personnel, to ensure there are no disruptions in the supply of medicine, and in recent weeks we resumed activity in the majority of our clinical trials where enrollment had been paused. Resuming in-person promotional activities when it's safe on a country-by-country and on a state-by-state basis in the U.S., and we will continue to use these virtual engagement tools we've built to augment in-person promotional activities.  Throughout Q2 we saw a steady increase in customer contacts and medical education touch points as we leveraged new platforms to reach physicians. We continue to see increased interest in volume of virtual interactions from physicians and expect a hybrid model of in-person remote engagement for some time in the U.S. as well as internationally.  We also made good progress this quarter, executing our R&D strategy, launching two new medicines in the U.S., including Retevmo, the first therapy ever approved for patients with RET driven lung and thyroid cancers, and Lyumjeva, a fast acting mealtime insulin for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.  Taltz and non-radiographic axSpA, Cyramza in combination with erlotinib for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer and Tauvid, our new diagnostic for patients with Alzheimer's disease who were also approved in the U.S.  Several positive Phase 3 readouts this quarter include Verzenio in adjuvant breast cancer, now the first and the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to succeed in this population. Mirikizumab and psoriasis compared to both placebo and head-to-head versus Cosentyx and just today in collaboration with Boehringer and Jardiance in heart failure patients with reduced injection fraction, both with and without diabetes. We also continue to make progress on our potential COVID-19 therapies. Notably, the initiation of multiple clinical trials developing neutralizing antibodies, both as monotherapy and in combination. Dan will provide you with more detail during the R&D update. The unprecedented pace at which we're executing this project across our development and manufacturing organizations is evidence of what we are capable as an innovative company.  As I mentioned earlier, our Q2 business results were negatively impacted by COVID-19; however, we remain confident in the underlying fundamentals of our business. COVID-19 had a meaningful impact on economic activity and we observed the following trends in the U.S. A sharp decline in the number of patient visits to physicians dropping to roughly 50% of pre-COVID-19 levels. Reduce visits translated into fewer new prescriptions with the peak impact in late April and early May in most therapeutic classes.  A slow return to health care activity through a combination of Telehealth and in-person visit as IQVIA data showed patient visits were back to 85% of pre-COVID-19 levels in June, and new prescriptions slowly beginning to recover although some variation across therapeutic areas. While the outlook for economic activity is uncertain, we remain optimistic that patients, physicians and hospital systems will continue to find ways to ensure patients can access the medicines they need.  Turning to our Q2 results, as expected reduced patient visits and inventory dynamics were both a drag on otherwise solid total prescription trends. Revenue declined 2% compared to Q2, 2019 and we estimated revenue was negatively impacted by the reversal of largely all of the $250 million of stocking related to COVID-19 that we experienced in Q1. While most existing prescriptions were maintained, new patient prescriptions declined in Q2 relative to pre-COVID-19 baselines. We estimate this impact to have been about $250 million across the portfolio.  Taking into account current trends, we are on track to deliver the financial goals we established for 2020. The strength of our new products, our ability to scale them worldwide and our productivity agenda position us well to continue to deliver robust business performance and to create shareholder value.  Moving to slide five, you'll see the full list of key events since our last earnings call. Before, Josh discusses our financial results, just a few comments about the executive orders that were announced last Friday. We all share the goal of making medicines more affordable and accessible to patients and believe concepts such as rebate reform and the sharing of savings within the eligible 340B patient population offer real opportunities to lower the out-of-pocket costs for patients quickly.  However, as I've noted before, the concept of international price indexing is a bad policy. This policy will have almost no benefit to patient out-of-pocket costs, but together with reimportation we'll most assuredly have serious negative consequences for patients for the safety of our supply chain and for the future of innovation. So now is the wrong time to introduce sweeping government actions that will at best distract and at worse, cripple the same industry that's racing to discover vaccines and treatments to defeat COVID-19.  Now, I'll turn the call over to John to review our Q2 results in more detail and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020. Thanks Dan. We're mobilizing our resources to pursue treatments of devastating diseases is a natural part of our history and our company's purpose, on a separate note I think all major employers are realizing we have a bigger role to play in the fight against systemic racial injustice and as a corporate leader in diversity inclusion, Lilly is committed to using our platform to speak up, speak out and work towards solutions to eliminate the racism and inequities that African-Americans and other minorities have experienced for far too long.  We are stepping up to bring people and organizations together to acknowledge the trauma of racial injustice, understand its many forms and create lasting change. To underscore our commitment to positive action, we also announced a pledge of $25 million and 25,000 employee volunteer hours over the next five years. The funding in volunteerism will be directed toward combating racial injustice and inequality primarily here in Indiana and we plan to partner with other businesses and community groups to achieve our goals.  While there's nothing easy about the road ahead, we can no longer accept systemic bias in any of its forms and the time for platitudes is now behind us. The time for meaningful actions, specifically by the corporate community to drive lasting change is in fact now, so a busy quarter.  Let me conclude with some closing comments on our progress in the first half of the year. As expected, our business experienced headwinds this quarter based on reduced new patient starts and changes in inventory we highlighted earlier this year. With that in mind, we are pleased that in the first half of 2020 we delivered strong volume driven revenue growth of 7% worldwide in constant currency.  We are cautiously optimistic about the recovery of both healthcare activity and prescription trends and expect both to accelerate during the second half of this year. We continue to find innovative ways to ensure our patients have access to their medicines and that we can support physicians and hospital systems as they provide care.  Our operating margin improved 200 basis points over the first half of 2019 and we made exciting progress on our pipeline this quarter. We saw three top line phase 3 data readouts from important clinical programs. We had five U.S. approvals for NMEs and line extensions and achieved a number of other clinical milestones that Dan just highlighted.  The COVID-19 global pandemic continues to be a disruptive force in the way we all work and live. Lilly and the broader pharmaceutical industry are working hard to develop new medicines to treat and to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We anticipate this disruption will continue till vaccines and new medicines can be used to manage the spread of the infection.  While near term challenges do exist, we remain confident in the long term outlook for our company and the strength of our fundamentals. Lilly and Lilly people will continue to rise to the challenge and I'm incredibly proud of our efforts to combat the global health crisis, social and economic crises we currently face.  This concludes our prepared remarks. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin who'll moderate the Q&A session. Yeah, thanks Geoff. Well, I mean you know we all observed last Friday's announcements. I think mostly these are not perceiving new ideas, so my statement's maybe a repeat from prior calls. But on IPI specifically, you know this is being proposed under the CMMI model, Affordable Care Act, so that by itself is probably a problem. It just seems to regulate the entirety of the U.S. position infused market via that mechanism, and you know you expect the industry to vigorously challenge that authority here as to create new authority.  But if implemented, and we have yet to see the tax by the way. I'm not sure the White House has put that out yet, but let's assume it's something like the 2018, a blueprint proposal. We are relatively under exposed to this idea, because it affects part B physician infused drugs. Today you know the two material medicines fit that in our portfolio, Alimta and Cyramza. Of course Alimta, we expect a patent expiry in spring of '22, so you have a time window impact that's quite short. And Cyramza, which is obviously longer and a meaningful product, but a part of our growth story but not a cornerstone of it. Going forward, of course if we looked at future medicines in the pipeline, there are you know infused medicines in immunology and notably in Alzheimer's should those succeed that you know you'd be concerned about. But I think drug companies have more ability to navigate on future products than they do one past \u2013 products launches in the past, because you can affect your primarily European pricing outlook, perhaps with constrained demand in Europe, but focused on a common floor price for the U.S., so you know we can navigate it.  That said, it's a horrible policy and I think we'll \u2013 it sends a wrong message at a time when this industry is working literally day and night to help us all escape from COVID-19. Do we really want to be talking about this disruptive force and the most well capitalized companies that are least affected, biotech which you know we're not part of that small company group, but they will be severely affected and investor interest in many of their companies could drop precipitously. I think that would be a real loss for what is an industry that's basically U.S. based. So we'll fight it hard and hopefully it won't come to be.  On rebate, again this is an idea we've pursued before for some time, as well as frankly you know we're not disappointed by the 340B pass through idea that was presented as well. We think that the patients who drive the volume, that plans negotiate discounts on should benefit from those discounts.  Frankly as they do in every other part of the healthcare system except medicines, so that we think cost sharing and copay should be based on net price not list and these ideas for that. Again, lots of barriers to implementation on those as well, as your other groups who oppose them, but we'll continue to support that concept of sharing the savings. Yeah, thanks Andrew. On the EOs you're talking about read every form and the pass through and the history here is as you pointed out, the CEO score was extremely negative. In our math largely driven by the one assumption you noted, which is that rebate value which essentially grew back to manufacturers and thus raised premiums. It's a deeply flawed assumption. Of course we'll compete, but the whole idea would be to move the basis competition from sort of discriminated prices that are private to list price or other means to deliver pricing directly to consumers discounts that pass through for instance.  So that of course requires industry actors to change their practices and that's not something that can be coordinated or messaged very well due to the antitrust laws. So we're sort of in this catch 22 on committing to deliver on sharing the savings, but not being able to do that publicly.  I think that's a problem. I mean it's particularly a problem for legislation. Of course the executive order method has other problems in terms of legal power, but if enacted under administrative rules, you know there isn't necessarily a requirement to square the budget, so savings can be assumed in other ways and there's a different authority doing the math. That said, I think there are headwinds on this point, both within the administrative executive branch, as well as on the hill. Nonetheless it's the right thing to do and I think we need to continue to push for ways that everyone would have confidence that the industry would compete in a way that would lower consumer out-of-pocket costs. I can tell you that's the goal when we advocate for this policy, and we need to find ways to provide that assurance I think to get movement. You talked about Senate finance and Grassley reintroduced a version of his bill to try to make one last push. I believe his chairmanship is ending in any case at the end of this Congress, so it's understandable why he's doing that. I don't think that that package has much of a chance to advance. There are always ways stars get align and there's a number of health extenders do at the end of this Congress, but it's a pretty big piece of legislation to throw on an extenders package. The only possible way is that it does produce a positive budget impact in terms of use to pay for other things, but probably you don't need the whole package.  So I think that's still a narrow path and the most likely scenario is that these EOs can't take the force and don't take force prior to a new presidential term, a new congression, Congress sitting and the Senate finance doesn't go anywhere either nor does HR3. I think that's sort of a probable planning scenario. Maybe just add to that, it goes maybe without saying, to help say it, the current utilization of GLPs in the total diabetes population in developed markets is something like one in eight or one it 10 patients. And so the hope here is that we can rearrange the priorities and the sequence of treatment in a way where this powerful category in here are duel acting GLP, GIP could be used earlier and more broadly to manage disease outcomes in a very different way. Today Type 2 diabetes disease is a failure and perhaps this technology could help doctors and patients find success much earlier in the disease course. Great! And on international pricing, I think we've talked about this before, but we don't have that many proxies for this kind of situation, but what we do know is economic activity, particularly in Europe and Japan has fallen like in the U.S. Tax receipts accordingly and if we use 2008 as a proxy, really took almost three years for the policy implications of that to show up in drug pricing health budgets. I think that's natural because there's a lag in tax receipts and then there's a lag in policy making in response to it.  I would expect that to happen, and the normal things that occur are clawback mechanisms and methods to keep the medicines budget within some proportion of the health budget. I think that will be a headwind the industrial will face over the next two or three years.  I would say though that, if history follows, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, because Europeans in particular were successful at capping drugs, spending growth in the early part of the last decade. The burden of that tends to follow \u2013 fall disproportionately on older products that are scaled and perhaps with more competition in the categories, whereas as newer products I think actually weren't really affected. They are more driven by helping technology assessment and the procedures to get an initial price and they don't really drive much budget pressure versus end of life.  As you know, we continually advocate for more biosimilar and generic adoption in these markets is the first lever to pull and so I think also for products they are supposed to buy similar in generics you probably would see more pressure on the back end of this as well. Yeah Vamil, for some now we've been on a journey to build out the capabilities to reach customers where they want to be reached and have relevant information at that time, as well as around launches and key data readouts to be able to expand our capacity beyond just the sales channel to reach customers.  That has proven pretty useful through this pandemic and I would say overall the conditions which as I mentioned in my prepared remarks are variable around the world in terms of being able to safely send reps in the field and actually even be able to be let into medical buildings and facilities. I think there's a constraint there. So we've leaned into this, we've accelerated some of the plans we had to increase volume and the richness of this capability.  Overall, I think the results are \u2013 I think we prefer to run the hybrid model everywhere where we have sales reps and these capabilities, where we can't send sales reps these capabilities have been useful. Is it as productive? I think it's certainly more efficient and it's more scalable. Whether it's as impactful, I think we'll need to watch through time. We have different markets we serve and I can say that in specialty markets where you get a smaller number physicians and you can target your efforts extremely well. We mention Retevmo launch on this call, which is a kind of a first thing for us was an approval and launch during the pandemic. I think we are pretty pleased with the progress there.  On the other hand, primary care brands, you know it's a little more challenging, because the way these practices are run and the variability and physicians accessibility. So I think the whole industry is probably learning this, but on the other side of this we'll have a much more enhanced capability and you can bet we are spending huge amounts of time on a global basis lifting that up now in a way that's a pretty rigorous. So you know more to come there. Productivity to be seen, efficiency yes, effectiveness, you know we probably see a lot of variability right now. Thanks Kevin. Well, we appreciate your participation in our earnings call today and a remarkable quarter and thank you for your interest in Eli Lilly.  Please follow-up with our IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn't address today and hope everyone stays well. We'll talk to you soon."

            "name": "A - Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Great! Thanks Seamus for those questions about the COVID-19 antibodies. Maybe just starting with timing, you know of course the timing of data disclosures depends on how best trials enroll and what the data show. We're committed to getting important information out to the public and the scientific communities as quickly as it's available. With respect to the phase 2 trial, that is focused on viral load, I think this is going to be the first and probably a key indicator of potential efficacy for this approach, and I commented that we expect to have that data to disclose from this 400 patient phase 2 trial in Q4, but again, that just depends on how best we can enroll these patients.  Your second question there was around the rational for a single antibody versus two or three or cocktails of even more antibiotics have been proposed, and specifically you have to look around efficacy. So I think we and others have looked at monotherapy versus combination therapy in a variety of preclinical models for the disease and looking at neutralization of the virus infection of human cells for example.  And what you'll find is that combinations don't offer efficacy groups. A single antibody can generally neutralize the virus just as well as combinations of antibody. The reason that people sometimes try combinations of antibodies, because they're worried that over time resistance could emerge. So I don't expect to see any efficacy booster, efficacy denumeration for having a combo or monotherapy in clinical trials.  What we'll be looking for instead is whether or not there's an emergence of resistance. There are some factors that make that somewhat less likely here. I think the extremely high potency of 555 and its ability to effectively neutralize virus very, very quickly may decrease the risk of resistance. We've done some primary studies and we've not seen resistance emerge in those studies at all. But we'll be watching patients carefully and we have the combination therapy that will move forward as a backup if resistance is seen. The advantages of monotherapy are obvious and you commented on them. It's simply that if you have one antibody, you can manufacture twice as much as a combo of two antibodies, three times as much as three antibodies. In a situation like this, I think they are just starting a tradeoff that might indicate maximizing manufacturing capacity is the key objective and so that's where we're heading here. Thank you."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Well Geoff, thanks for the question on Verzenio and the duration question is an important one and something that we're really excited about as part of the additional opportunity in EBC, and so we do expect the duration of treatment to be longer than the metastatic setting. And to your question, what we've seen in the RWE in the metastatic setting is about eight months.  Now we'll need to see what that actually is once the patients are being treated upon approval in the adjuvant setting, but obviously we're encouraged. The fact is the treatment duration in the study itself was 24 months. So we do expect it to be much longer than the eight months that we see in the metastatic setting. Well, thanks for the question Tim on Verzenio and we believe we've seen really positive trends will Verzenio in the metastatic setting and I think josh mentioned those in some of the intro, and we've really capitalized on the positive overall survival data from one or two in the combination with that strength. And so we've seen versus Q2 2019 is worldwide growth of 56% in revenue and U.S. growth is 35%.  And then if we looked globally, we now had 49 approvals worldwide and I think probably an important metric is the Japan NBRx share of the market now, it's 58%. So we're seeing a very strong launch in Japan, and so we believe obviously that with specifically significant survival data, that's really the gold standard in this class and so we believe that more and more physicians will be trying Verzenio and we've seen that in the continued increase in the NBRx and so we'll continue to share that message.  We believe that this is the best-in-class agent and I think it just goes to that whole picture of the differentiation that we see with Verzenio over time and I just think that that will shift physicians' minds.  Mark has the results from monarchE as Dan mentioned, really do differentiate it from both CDK 4/6 and then we've got the statistically significant results, not just in the overall population, but then in the hard to treat population, those with visceral disease and primary endocrine resistant. And again, you didn't see that with some of the other CDK 4/6's.  So I think we're starting to feel pretty strongly and I think physicians are starting to agree with us that we have a differentiated agent here, and so you'll continue to see us press in the metastatic setting, because we have that survival data, and now we get to make the move into the other trend setting. Yeah, so thanks for the question Terence. So on the presentation we will be presenting at a medical meeting later this year. Unfortunately I can't confirm which one yet, but we will be presenting at the meeting this year. As far as on the penetration, well that's I think what's exciting about this opportunity, is that we are the only CDK 4/6 to have positive results in the adjuvant setting. And so I think our penetration for the high risk patients, which is the population that we had in MonarchE will be extremely high.  So as we're hearing people ramp even to the top line opportunity, we're seeing that there's a lot of enthusiasm for having CDK 4/6 this setting, and so we look forward to sharing those results as I said later this year. Again, we see I think Dan and others mentioned in the introduction, we see this as an opportunity of only about 20,000 patients here in the U.S., as we matched our criteria in the study to the Sierra database.  So I think we see a pretty significant opportunity. It's really probably half again of what we have in the metastatic setting, which has been significant. So to answer your question, we do expect strong penetration in this space over time. Great! So thanks so much for that question on the Verzenio eligible population. So as I said in the U.S. about 20,000 eligible patients, which is about 10% to 15% of the HR positive, HER2- EBC positive. Outside the U.S. the pathology is similar and we estimated. So we estimated patient numbers in Europe about 10% larger than the U.S. and then Japan is about one-fourth of the side of the U.S. So I hope that answers the estimate questions outside the U.S. Well Steve, thanks for the question. Obviously we just shared the top line at this time, so I can't go into detailed data as you know, part of the data disclosure. But what I can tell you is that we do believe that the possible results from monarchE are clinically meaningful and will add to the existing body of evidence that's presenting, differentiated from other CDK 4/6s, and this is a major milestone for presenting you know and we believe does have the potential to change the paradigm of how early breast cancer is treated. So we really look forward to sharing the data with you at a meeting later this year. Well, thanks Navin for the questions on Retevmo. So the launch is going well as Dave mentioned in his introduction and so we're encouraged by the early demand signals that we've seen with Retevmo, and his customer feedback on the data has been very positive. So they're impressed by the efficacy and safety data across multiple indications and lines of therapy that we're able to get into the label, and it's the largest obviously RET inhibition population that's been studied in 700 patients.  We don't have Rx data to report yet, but we're aware of patient starts in a number of our top accounts, which is supported by the downstream channel orders. So it's clear that our first to market advantage is resulting in the treatment of patients who have identified even in previous testing. So that kind of leads to your question around diagnostic testing.  So what we've seen historically is that RET is showing up on panels probably about 30% of the time. So you've hit on one of the key criteria's of the launch is to continue to drive that testing right up and so it's been very much a focus of our efforts, both to work with the pathologist out in the U.S. on making sure that they have RET on their panels now. We have a very actionable biomarkers for them to test against.  Our goal is essentially to eventually see testing rates like we see in some of the other targeted therapies, which approach 80%. Now the question that we'll all have to assess is how quickly we can get there, but our goal is to drive that up as quickly as we possibly can, and so that's a big focus of the launch.  And we have a partnership with Thermo Fisher and Illumina and other things in the works to really drive that up across the industry. Because we do believe that that's actually the best care for patients regardless they were treated with Retevmo or other targeted therapies that we want patients to get the right therapy for them.  As far as the time lines, so as you know we've submitted in Europe and so we are waiting regulatory action there. That submission was accepted at the beginning of this year, and then we looked to submit in Japan and China either late this year or early next, so still working with regulatory authorities there."

            "content": "Okay, for tirzepatide we're glad to see that your wowed by our phase 2 data and for patients struggling with type 2 diabetes. You know I think the best thing to really do is to go back and take a look at the phase 2 clinical studies. I mean we saw at the 50 milligram dose up to 2.4% A1C reduction and weight loss up to 12.7% versus placebo in just six months of starting. So we're excited to see how tirzepatide can perform in this patient population and longer studies in phase 3.  There's nothing to tell us that we won't see you know exciting data coming out of the phase 3, we don't have any new information that suggests otherwise, so we are incredibly confident about tirzepatide, not only in type 2 diabetes, but also we're excited to see its potential in Nash [ph] and obesity. So our enthusiasm remains very, very high. Thank you for the question. It's a great question on tirzepatide and I think we have a, just a phenomenal opportunity to not just be able to provide glucose control for those living with Type 2 Diabetes, but really affect their overall metabolic health. And so I think the contributions of both GLP and GIP can provide the opportunity to really provide improved metabolic health across Type 2 Diabetes, obesity and NASH that are related.  And so it's a great question and I think it's a good opportunity for us to expand our focus beyond just helping someone living with Type 2 diabetes, better control their glucose. So a great question and obviously an area that that we will focus on. There will be people living with Type 2 diabetes that are in our NASH and obesity studies."

            "name": "Patrick Jonsson",
            "content": "Hey, thank you very much. Well the overall CGRP market continues to grow very nicely and when we look at from the market growth, year-over-year, we are about the growth of 64%, plus this last year.  While in Emgality he actually continues to significantly out-perform the market with growth of 151%. And even if you look at the last quarter, we see that CGRP market continued to grow with 12% despite the significant decline in terms of new-to-brand. And we continue to remain very confident in the future of Emgality and aiming for a market leadership in the preventive market and we see also strong market leadership, I think that in primary care where we have expanded our effort in 2020 and with quite a few new trail. So very, very optimistic in terms of the CGRP market for Emgality.  If we look from the Retevmo launch, I think it's fair to say that we are not pleased with the performance so far, but we need to have in mind that we had approximately one month in the market place prior to we were hit by COVID-19 and we made the conscious decision to actually pull back from our promotional efforts, both in the field, as well as in terms of seasoning promotional growth.  We have started to start-up virtual proactive detailing and we remain very confidence in the molecule taking into account that it's the only one, but actually can offer a strong relief from the most painful physical symptoms, as well as the most problems in symptoms associated with the migraine, and we know there is a huge opportunity. Out of the 6 million people being treated in the U.S. today, 35% to 40% of those are not responding to the treatment, and in terms of efficacy really, with one single dose we believe we have the unique value proposition, but still work to be done, lot of work to be done."

            "name": "Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks Josh. Since our last call we've had major lifecycle readouts for three of our most important new medicines; Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. All three were positive, all represent clinically meaningful advances for patients and all should help drive continued growth for these important brands. I'll speak briefly about each, as well as the Phase 3 readout from mirikizumab, a molecule still under development.  In addition to advancing our existing R&D portfolio, we have devoted significant efforts to creating and testing potential therapies for COVID-19 and here too we have made good progress this quarter. Before I go through the pipeline update, I'll provide an update on our COVID-19 therapies.  Moving to slide 14, we provide an overview of the active programs we are pursuing to treat or prevent COVID-19. These programs have moved with unprecedented speed and hopes of finding new medicine to help blunt the impact of the virus.  Baricitinib our JAK inhibitor has two ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The anti-inflammatory activity observed by baricitinib in other diseases is thought to be potentially beneficial in treating COVID-19.  The first trial is investigating baricitinib in combination with remdesivir as part of the NIAID's Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial and we expect to have data from this trial within the coming months. The second trial is Lilly sponsored and is assisting baricitinib as monotherapy. We expect results from this trial later this year.  Second, we are pursuing a Phase 2 trial of an antibody that targets Angiopoietin 2, which has been observed to be elevated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. Based on trial enrolment we now expect to have data in-house this fall to inform next steps.  While these two efforts may inform treatment of symptoms of COVID-19, the approach I'm most excited about is virus neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, both a single antibody therapies and in combinations. We currently have efforts ongoing with LY-CoV555 which arose from our collaboration with AbCellera and with LY-CoV016 which we licensed from Junshi Biosciences. The development status is summarized on slide 15.  Both the antibodies have completed dosing in their Phase 1 studies with safety and PK results that support advancing the molecules. Neither Phase 1 study was designed to collect efficacy data, that is a 555 trail that only enrolled six patients per dose and O16 enrolled only healthy volunteers. 555 is further along in development and is progressed to a large dose ranging Phase 2 study in ambulatory patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Here we are focused on reducing viral load. The study is enrolling quickly, and we should have data to report by Q4. This will be our first opportunity to share human efficacy data from the neutralizing antibody program.  Based on safety and tolerability data gathered to-date, as well as taking into accounts the gravity of the unmet medical need here, we plan to initiate registrational studies in the coming weeks, even in advance of having efficacy data. We've been in studies across several different patient populations including a Phase 3 study for prevention of COVID-19 in residents and staff at long term care facilities, as well as additional registrational studies for potential treatment indication in both the ambulatory and hospitalized settings. Once underway, the timing for data disclosure from these trials will be highly dependent on patient enrollment and any intern efficacy and safety data we may see.  In addition to the monotherapy trials I describe for 555, we intend to test the combination of O16 with 555, in case such a combination is needed to combat viral resistance. We look forward to producing additional data for both programs and we'll provide updates as we achieve program milestones or data become available. We continue to invest in manufacturing for these potential therapies at risk and we are focused on ramping up our manufacturing capacity as quickly as possible.  While developing treatments for COVID-19 is an important priority for Lilly right now, we also continue to advance the rest of our pipeline, to help people with diabetes, immune disorders, neurodegeneration and cancer.  One particularly exciting development this quarter was the positive interim readout of the MonarchE trial, assessing the use of Verzenio to reduce the risk of recurrence in (HR)-positive, HER2-negative high risk early breast cancer. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor to show a benefit in this setting, where another competing product failed at our T-cell analysis.  Our conviction and the differentiation of Verzenio from the competition continues to increase based on important data, including safety and tolerability data and mechanism of action that have allowed for continuous dosing and therefore continues target inhibition. This is a unique feature of abemaciclib.  Clinical efficacy that support use even as a monotherapy in metastatic breast cancer, another unique feature of abemaciclib. The demonstrated benefited overall survival in the metastatic setting in combination with fulvestrant, something not all CDK4/6 inhibitors have been able to show and most recently, positive result in the adjuvant setting, another unique feature of abemaciclib.  These data continue to support our convictions, but not all CDK4/6 inhibitors are the same. The positive results in MonarchE could significantly increase the opportunity for Verzenio. Looking at the MonarchE study clinical pathological criteria for enrolment, we estimate that approximately 20,000 patients in the U.S. would match these criteria. This represents a roughly 50% increase over the current addressable market in metastatic breast cancer.  Our market projected to reach almost $7 billion in 2020. In addition we anticipate duration of therapy in the adjuvant setting will be longer. We plan to submit this data by the end of the year to regulators around the world and to present them at a major medical meeting in 2020.  Moving to slide 17, we also presented important Trulicity data at the virtual ADA and ENDO meetings this summer. In the on-treatment analysis the 3 milligram and 4.5 milligram doses of Trulicity demonstrated statistically significant improvement in hemoglobin A1C reduction and weight loss versus the currently approved 1.5 milligram dose at 36 weeks.  These doses could allow our patients to receive additional clinical benefits and stay on Trulicity, but still experiencing Trulicity's ease of use. We look forward to U.S. any EU regulatory action on the additional doses of Trulicity later this year.  At the virtual ADA we also share data which builds upon the existing body of evidence demonstrating the simplicity of the Trulicity patient experience, combined with its powerful efficacy.  In this real world analysis of patients after a minimum of six months of follow-up in the U.S., Trulicity demonstrated significantly higher adherence and persistence compared to two other weekly GLP-1. In addition, significantly fewer people discontinued treatment on Trulicity compared to other agents. This real world evidence complements the robust clinical data generated for Trulicity and provides further support for why Trulicity is the market leading GLP-1.  Moving to slide 18, you can see our select pipeline opportunities as of July 23. Movements since our last earnings call includes the previously mentioned U.S. approvals for Lyumjev, Retevmo, and Tauvid. The U.S. approval of Taltz for non-radiographic axSpA and Cyramza for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer, the initiation of the Phase 3 tirzepatide cardiovascular outcome study SURPASS-CVOT, the advancement of three new Phase 2 programs, the initiation of three Phase 1 programs and the attrition of our first generation KRAS G12C molecule.  While we were excited about our initial KRAS program, we observed unexpected toxicity in the clinic that precluded further development. We are working to understand the mechanistic basis for the toxicity and we are exploring a backup program.  Moving to slide 19, we provided an update on our 2020 key events that occurred during the quarter. In addition to the previously mentioned approvals, initiations and pipe in progress, we submitted Alimta [ph] in the U.S. for atopic dermatitis. As Dave mention earlier, we also announced positive phase 3 read outs for Jardiance in heart failure and mirikizumab in psoriasis. Beginning with Jardiance, we were optimistic about the likelihood of success in heart failure based on compelling CV data seen in diabetic patients in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial. We were pleased to see a positive outcome for the first heart failure trial to read out EMPERIAL-Reduced and will present the data in August at the European Society of Cardiology and submit to regulators later this year. We look forward to additional Jardiance data readouts, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the EMPERIAL-Preserved trial in 2021 and the chronic kidney disease, EMPA-KIDNEY study in 2022.  We also noticed a positive readout from mirikizumab phase 3 in psoriasis, including success on the primary and all key secondary endpoints. It's particularly encouraging to see such robust data from mirikizumab in a head-to-head trial, since trial of such disease are the gold standard for comparing agents.  Indeed, we had a number of positive head-to-head trials with Taltz in psoriasis and now we're pleased to see mirikizumab demonstrate superiority versus percentage at 52 weeks on both about passing 90 and passing 100.  Despite growing a competition is psoriasis, Taltz remains an excellent option for patients that delivers clear skin fast. These new data suggest that mirikizumab also has a consensual to be a meaningful treatment for people living with psoriasis. We look forward to submitting mirikizumab in this indication and importantly, these data further our conviction in IBD, where we see the biggest opportunity.  Given the relative priority of indications, we've been staging our investments in psoriasis. We work on going to prepare for the psoriasis submission and plan to submit in the second half of 2021. Accordingly, we've also provided an updated timeline for the phase 3 data of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We now expect the topline results production for ulcerative colitis in the spring of 2021 and for Crohn's disease in 2022.  Since we announced the pause of new trial starts and enrollment in many programs back in March, I'm pleased to report that we've re-opened enrollment in the vast majority of clinical trial and we are again initiating new trials.  As we partner with clinical trial sites going forward, we made a number of changes to how we run clinical trials that allow for many chances to be completed virtual. These two capabilities have come from necessity, but are also improvements on the way clinical research is conducted and it's something we'll continue going forward.  These are challenging times in drug development, but Lilly has demonstrated we have the creativity to adapt to the new environment and we're committed to bringing new medicines to patients.  Dave, back to you for some closing remarks. Yeah, sure. Umer, thanks for both those questions. So on the COVID map, you should be asking about the rational going into registrational studies without having seen efficacy data; its not something we usually do. You're right, of course here it's \u2013 as I said the gravity of the situation and then look at it with which we desire to test these therapies, that have driven us to that decision. You asked about sort of trends that might have encouraged us from the phase 1 study and unfortunately the answer is we don't have anything to talk about. We had one phase 1 study that was with healthy volunteers, so that they didn't have COVID-19, nothing was due there. The other was so small and in the hospitalized patients six patients per dose group and I think what we saw there is basically what you would expect across doses and placebo.  All of the patients actually did really well and got better and left the hospital. That's not atypical for a phase 1 study here that populations of physicians typically pulled into those studies are some of the better patients who might be at the end of their disease course. I wouldn't expect antibodies in any case to have much effect in people whose viral load is already low and their immune system is already clearing the disease, so that's where we are.  I think the phase 2 study on the other hand is patients who are early in the disease course. They are just within a few days of getting diagnosed. My expectations go up high and in many cases the increasing viral loads in the absence of therapy and it goes here to show that the therapy decreases the viral loads. So that's important read out, but as I said, we'll have started the phase 3's by then. On KRAS, this is an issue of off target toxicity, so it's not related to it. The KRAS target itself is our view, that does therefore killed the therapeutic index and not possible to proceed with that drug. I don't think we at this moment could give details on the exact nature of the toxicity or the highest dose that we tested, but we did feel we could proceed based on the doses at which we saw that tox and we're trying to resolve that in the backup program, make some preclinical models for the toxicity and take care of it now. Yeah sure, thanks. On baricitinib, of course we're encouraged and the reason we did this trials is based on preclinical data around the mechanism of action of baricitinib and I think the clinical effects of the immune-modulating in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 has been next as you pointed out, but the [inaudible] have also been some promising efficacy signals and even success, so of course with dexamethasone.  So I think we just have to wait and see how this works. Treating patients in a hospitalized setting is important. If we can reduce like the stay or decrease mortality, that will be an exciting result and maybe a stopgap measure until we have the medicines that actually can fight off the virus. So like I hope the neutralizing antibodies will.  As for N3pG, yeah, we are still on the same timeline as we've always been. The trial will wrap up at the very end of this year, which means we'll have data internally and likely some kind of top line, just in the very start of next year. I think given that the size of the study, we have a reasonably high furlough rate and we are hoping to see a large effect size. We base that belief on the level of plaque clearingwe can get.We can get deeper and faster plaque clearance than has been shown with any other agent. So if clearing plaque is important stopping disease progression, we should have a strong effect.  It's noteworthy that we also designed this trial to select a very careful patient population based on the entire levels at baseline, so we also expect smaller standard deviation, because the population should have a more uniform progression. I'd also note that we started the second trial N3pG already. Yeah, thanks and with respect to TAURIEL antibody, again here, I just say we're still on track for the data readout. This will come in the second half of the next year. I'm excited about this mechanism, but we don't have clinical data yet. The Roche readout will be important and we'll be watching it carefully and of course on behalf of patients and the mechanism we'll be hoping for their success.  But there are some differences as you pointed out, both in molecule and trial design that make read through more complicated. One I think important aspect of molecule design is that there's lots of different species of tau in the brain. There's a lot of soluble Tau that is monomeric and probably not involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease that can sop up antibody and sort of reduce the effective amount of antibody available to get the bad kinds of tau.  Our antibodies are designed specifically to bind the aggregated tau. So we think that should improve its ability to actually hit the target. Very high doses of these antibodies are generally used to overcome this soluble monomeric tau problem. So that's one difference between that Roche antibody and in fact all of the competitors and ours.  The second difference is there are on trial design and here again, we use our unique expertise in tau imaging and biomarkers to select a patient population that we think (a) will be more uniformity in its disease progression [inaudible] better and (b) be more likely to be responsive to Tau therapeutic. It's like these therapies will be effective \u2013 they are effective at stopping the spread of tau rather than removing pre-formed Tau and so I think it's important to have patients who are in the midst of the spreading tau, not patients that tau has spread throughout the entire brain. So we'll watch them carefully, but they'll be cautious on read through. Yeah Dave, thanks for the question on the timing of the Phase 2. Your right, it's a 400 patient study that initiated last month. It got up to a bit of a slow start. I think as we at that time, in the country the pandemic shifted in geographies, we shifted our efforts accordingly. It's now enrolling very, very quickly.  The timing of data disclosure depends on that rate of enrollment though. So it could in fact be sooner than Q4. I think I'm confident it will be by of course sometime during Q4 at the latest. As you point out, the day-11 time point is a critical point. So 400 patients enrolled and then 11 days later, need differential swabs and a viral assessment and then database lock and then analysis and reporting, all-in-all it'll just take probably a couple of weeks from the end of the study. So we'll keep investors updated and the community updated on the progress of the study. That's where we are today."

            "content": "Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. Moving to slide six and seven, our non-GAAP financial performance in 2Q and during the first half of 2020 was impacted by COVID-19 across many lines of the income statement. As Dave mentioned, revenue declined 2% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019. It was negatively impacted by COVID-19 in two ways. First; largely all of the $250 million of COVID related stock in Q1 reversed as excess supply in the channel and in medicine cabinets was consumed and Q2 closing inventory returned to historically normal levels.  Second, reduced patient visits due to COVID-19 resulted in lower new prescriptions across many of our brands, which we estimate had a negative impact on Q2 revenue of approximately $250 million as well. We estimate this impact to be a temporary step down in market size, which we expect will return to pre-COVID levels over the balance of the year, with the pace of recovery varying by therapeutic area.  Given the stocking and destocking seen between quarters, our first half performance of 7% sales growth in constant currency is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance. Gross margin as a percent of revenue in Q2 was 79.6%, a decline of 140 basis points versus Q2, 2019, driven primarily by the negative impact of price, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment.  Moving down the P&L, selling, general and administrative expenses declined 9% this quarter compared to Q2, 2019, as reduced marketing and travel meeting expenses were only partially offset by investment in virtual tactics. Research and development expenses declined 1% as a pause in clinical trials have shifted activity and expenses to the second half of 2020.  In total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half \u2013 sorry, I'm just having a technical issue here. We just had a system problem.  So in total, operating income decreased 2% compared to Q2, 2019. During the first half of 2020 operating income increased by 14% as revenue growth outpaced operating expense growth by 500 basis points. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28% during the second quarter and 29.1% for the first half of 2020.  We continue to adapt the way we allocate resources to efficiently the operating environment, where the threat of COVID-19 is likely to be disruptive for a sustained period of time. We are expanding our virtual capabilities to support executing our strategy and are committed to our 2020 full year operating margin target of 31%.  Other income and expense was income of $447 million this quarter compared to an expense of $32 million in Q2, 2019. This quarter's other income was primarily driven by the increase in value of investments in Asian biopharma companies, as well as previously private companies that went public here in the U.S.  We have investments across a range of private and public biopharma companies as a part of our external innovation strategy and these investments allow us to nurture emerging science and access potential new medicines and novel modalities. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.4%, an increase of 340 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven by the mix of our earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and a lower net discrete tax benefit than last year. At the bottom line earnings per share increased 26% in Q2 as a sizable gain on public equities more than offset the decline in operating income. During the first half of 2020, earnings per share increased 29%.  On slide eight we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue. Worldwide revenue declined 2% during Q2 as volume growth of 6% was offset by price. Foreign exchange had an additional 1% negative impact on revenue growth. During the first half of 2020 revenue grew 7% in constant currency and volume grew 13% and price declined 7% or 5% excluding the impact Alimta and Tyvyt had in China.  U.S. revenue decline 3% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 4% was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Emgality and Verzenio. As mentioned earlier, we saw destocking at the wholesaler and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of negative impact during the quarter. In addition, we estimate reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $150 million.  Pricing was an 8% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, impacted by predominately changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, most notably impacting Humalog, which was driven primarily by favorable Medicaid adjustments in the prior period and unfavorable commercial adjustments in the current period. Then to a lesser extent by higher growth across the portfolio and lower net price segment, and increased rebate to maintain our strong commercial access, which was partially offset by reduced copay program utilization for Emgality and Taltz as a function of improved access versus last year. As we previously discussed, our quarterly pricing trends in the U.S. fluctuate based on delayed invoicing from customers, seasonality of copay assistant and our obligations during the coverage gap in Medicare Part D.  Excluding the impact of the onetime Humalog adjustment and focusing on trends that impact our business going forward, we saw an underlying pricing trend of low single digit decline in Q2 versus Q2, 2019 and this is consistent with our current expectation of mid-single digit price decline for the year, with the underlying low single digit net price decline, combined with one-time adjustments in the first half of 2020 and modest effects of COVID-19 in the second half of the year.  During the first half of 2020 U.S. revenue increased 5% versus last year, volume grew 11% and price declined 6%. We are encouraged by the improving demand trends in recent weeks and more normalized shipping trends. As we conclude 2021 U.S. Contracting negotiations, we remain confident in our strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and our ability to maintain this going forward.  Moving on Europe, revenue declined 4% in constant currency as price and volume declined by 2% each. Strong volume growth from Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz was offset by volume declines from Cialis, Forteo, Olumiant, Strattera and Humalog. We estimate European revenue was reduced by approximately $50 million due to COVID-19 related destocking in Q2, and roughly $35 million due to COVID-19 related lower new prescription. Despite fluctuation across quarters, the underlying trends are very strong as Europe posted volume growth of 11% during the first half of 2020 as our new products continue to scale.  In Japan revenue declined by less than 1% in constant currency and 4% volume growth was more than offset by government mandated price decreases effective April 2020. In addition, we estimated reduced new prescriptions due to COVID-19, negatively impacted Q2 revenue by approximately $35 million. The solid volume growth of Verzenio, Trulicity, Olumiant and Cyramza were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by the increased competition for Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera.  In China, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by 50% volume growth, largely offset by price. Volume and price were both affected by the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs, which substantially increased access for patients to these important cancer medications.  Outside of the oncology portal in China we saw a rebound in new patient initiation and in person customer interaction as the pandemic's impact began to moderate. Our newest lunches, Trulicity, Taltz and Alimta are seeing good uptake in Humalog, Cymbalta are again exhibiting solid growth.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 7% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers. Strong performance from Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio was partially offset by decreased Cialis volume. Revenue was negatively impacted by COVID related reduced new prescription, by approximately $25 million, which was more than offset by the sale of the legacy product in Asia.  As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered over 12 percentage points to volume growth this quarter. The strong volume growth, volume trend in our key products was partially offset by a mix of competition and lower utilization of post-LOE products; Forteo and Cialis, as well as reduced [inaudible] royalty from the restructuring of our alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim that we announced last year. We exit the first half of 2020, pleased with a 16% year-to-date volume growth of our key products that delivered despite a challenging environment.  Slide 10 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total these brands generated nearly $3 billion of revenue this quarter making up 54% of revenue. While 12% volume growth from key products in Q2 is robust, the negative impact on new patient starts from COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 related inventory movement across borders were a drag on growth in the quarter. We put both of these impacts to be transient and we're seeing new-to-brand prescriptions recover in June and July. The underlying business is robust and while COVID-19 has impacted our therapeutic areas differently, our product specific trends within the market backdrop are strong.  In diabetes, Trulicity remains the market leader in the U.S. GLP-1 market with over 45% share of total prescription. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the GLP-1 class were 32% less than pre-COVID-19 levels at one point during Q2, activity is trending in the right direction and now fits at around negative 16% for the week ending July 17. Total prescription trends have slowed some, but we're still robust to the class and grew by 27% in Q2 compared to last year. As the class leader, Trulicity is well positioned for future growth, and we look forward to regulatory action later this year on the higher doses of Trulicity. We expect the potential launch of additional doses to be an important option to allow patients to realize benefits, while extending the duration of therapy on Trulicity.  And another large impact, growing diabetes class Jardiance maintained market leadership in the U.S. SGLT2 class, with over 57% share of total prescription. The SGLT2 class saw a similar magnitude of reductions as the GLP-1 class for new-to-brand prescriptions, as new prescriptions where 38% less than the pre-COVID-19 levels before recovering some in June and July. Current weekly trends are probably 15% below pre-COVID-19 levels.  Jardiance continues to be the catalyst for class growth in new and total prescriptions, growing over 12 percentage points faster than the market in Q2, with 32% growth versus last year. We're excited by the recently announced positive results of Jardiance in patients with heart failure and EMPEROR-Reduced trial and look forward to the EMPEROR-Preserved trail readout in 2021. We estimate the addressable market from each trial is up to $3 million additional patients in the U.S., adding a potential new source of future growth for Jardiance.  In oncology, Verzenio continues to show positive trends in the metastatic setting as U.S. share of the market in new-to-brand prescriptions continued to increase about 20%. While new-to-brand prescriptions for the CDK4/6 class were more than 30% below pre-COVID levels of 1 point in the quarter, Verzenio fared better at negative 19% and the most recent week of new-to-brand prescription is above the pre-COVID-19 average.  Verzenio had positive momentum as the monarchE trail result adds to the compelling existing data package. We look forward to presenting these data at a medical meeting later this year.  Tyvyt, our immuno-oncology product in collaboration with Innovent in China posted another strong quarter of performance and was the biggest driver of China's 50% volume growth in Q2. Tyvyt was added to the national drug reimbursement list in January this year and we anticipate strong sales momentum in the second half of 2020. We expect Tyvyt to continue to be an important driver of growth in China.  Our newest oncology medicine Retevmo had a strong launch despite the viewing during a challenging external environment. We are encouraged by early demand signals and initial customer feedback on the impressive safety and efficacy profile is very positive. Our sales force and medical science liaisons are actively engaging with 6,000 lung and thyroid specialists through virtual tactics, and our existing relationships with this customer base are leading to a high quality interactions and increased brand awareness for this first in class medicine. While still early in the launch, we are excited about the fast start and continue to believe we have the best-in-class products.  In immunology we saw strong new-to-brand trends with Pulse early in Q1, followed by a sizable but more gradual impact of COVID-19. Compared to pre-COVID levels, new-to-brand prescriptions across immunology declined 36%. While this category has also been slower to recover, the most recent weeks have showed improvement in trend. However, new-to-brand prescriptions for the total market are still 21% below pre-COVID levels.  Taltz continues to compete for leadership in Dermatology new-to-brand share of market and rheumatology trends are encouraging, although growing from a smaller base. Total Taltz prescriptions grew 11% in Q2 compared to Q1 and 35% versus Q2 2019. We remain confident that our compelling data package of head-to-head trials and recent approval in non-radiographic axSpA will deliver growth in a competitive field of immunology.  In migraine we've also seen a more prolonged decline in new-to-brand prescriptions due to COVID-19. New-to-brand prescriptions in the injectable CGRP class have been 15% to 20% below pre-COVID levels since late April and through July. Emgality's share of market remains strong with over 38% of new and total prescriptions within the class.  Although new-to-brand trends have been impacted by COVID-19, class growth for total prescriptions was robust in Q2, increasing 64% compared to last year and 12% versus Q1, 2020. Given the importance of primary care physicians in driving growth, with the return of active promotions from multiple competitors, we expect class growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2020.  Also in migraine or acute therapy REYVOW is significantly impacted by the lack of patient visit and the in-person customer interactions related to COVID-19. While uptake so far has been modest early in the launch, we'll make investments to drive awareness and focus our promotional efforts in the coming quarters to drive uptake. While the field is competitive, we continue to believe our portfolio of both acute and preventative treatment with two mechanisms of action is a differentiator for our migraine franchise.  On slide 11 we provide an update on capital allocation. During the first half of 2020 we invested over $4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned almost $2 billion to shareholders via share repurchase and the dividend.  We remain well capitalized and have the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. We expect to continue to enhance our long term growth by acquiring first or best-in-class pipeline assets and do not anticipate COVID impacts regarding travel and market uncertainty to affect our efforts.  Before we provide an update on our 2020 financial guidance, slide 12 provides an overview of the composition of our U.S. business led by payer segment mix. This is the topic of frequent interest to investors and is permanent [ph] as we monitor the currently high levels of unemployment and the potential for that to negatively impact our business. Based on growth sales during the first half of 2020, within our existing business, commercial plans make up the largest portion at around 40%. Medicare Part D is the second largest segment at approximately 20%, mainly due to our diabetes portfolio. Government and hospital segments make up roughly 15%, Medicaid is around 10%, Medicare Part D is nearly 5% and then non-contracted business uninsured and cash make up the remaining 10%.  So as we continue to monitor and analyze the potential impact of unemployment, causing people to lose their commercial insurance and potentially shift to Medicaid, our modeling suggests this will have a modest impact in 2020 and is contemplated in our financial guidance range.  We expect these trends to have a larger impact in 2021 and the magnitude will be driven by the size and duration of unemployment in the U.S., the quality of commercial or ACA Exchange Insurance plans, displace of employees move from, the majority of our products as newer products have smaller net pricing spread between Medicaid and commercial plan, and government stimulus or relief plans that may keep patients on commercial insurance.  While there is uncertainty on how all these factors will play out, at this time we anticipate increased utilization of Medicaid versus commercial insurance to be a moderate headwind to revenue in 2021 of approximately $200 million. This approximation contemplates peak U.S. unemployment in the low double digits in 2020, a gradual recovery in 2021, to high single digits percent unemployed by year end.  We do not have an estimate on the impact of the executive orders on 2021 at this point, but given the uncertainty around them and our modest exposure to Part B, we expect the near term impact to be limited. Given our view of 2021 pricing negotiations, we still expect mid-single digit price impact across the portfolio in 2021.  So now moving to slide 13, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on the best estimates at this time and similar to how we approach Q1. We are balancing transparency and insight into the current view of the business, with the uncertainty we are all facing surrounding the extend and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include healthcare activity returns to normal levels in the second half of 2020 as doctors utilize Telehealth for in-person visits to see patients despite potential additional COVID-19 outbreaks.  The recovery in new patient prescriptions improved in the U.S. reaching and then growing above pre-COVID-19 levels by Q4 for most brands, noting the trends will differ regionally and by brand; price headwinds from increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased U.S. unemployment continue to be modest; clinical trial sites remain open and active in enrolling patients and promotional spend in the second half of the year constitutes a mix of in-person customer interactions, direct to consumer advertising and investment in supporting digital promotion.  While uncertainty remains regarding the continued spread of COVID-19 and the resulting impact on the pace of economic recovery around the world, we believe healthcare activity will continue to be a priority and that patients and physicians will find ways to access healthcare.  We believe the stocking and destocking activity observed in Q1 and Q2 is largely washed out and we are encouraged by the demand trends and more normal shipping patterns we're seeing with our customers. As a result we're maintaining our revenue range, recognizing additional closures in the healthcare system could cause us to revisit that range later in the year.  Moving down the income statement, we are lowering our gross margin as a parent of revenue to be approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis. This reduction reflects changes in geographic mix and lower realized prices.  We expect our GAAP gross margin to be 78%. We are also lowering our range from marketing, selling and administrative expenses by $200 million to reflect savings from reduced travel meetings and in-person promotional activities, which are all partially offset by investments in digital capabilities. Our range for research and development expenses is unchanged. We expect savings associated with temporary pausing of clinical trial starts and enrolment to catch up in the second half of 2020 as we resumed activity in Q2. Of note, we can see positive data in our neutralizing antibody treatments for COVID-19 that supports product development. We plan to fully invest in registration of clinical trial and further scaling of manufacturing capacity.  Under this scenario our research and development expenses are likely to be on the high end of our range as Lilly is self-funding all of these programs. We believe these investors are important to help combat the impact of the global pandemic.  Our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue goal of 31% remains as a reduction in total operating expenses offset through slightly lower gross margin percentage. We're updating the range for other income and expense the $350 million to $500 million of income, reflecting gains in our equity portfolio as seen in the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this number is of course subject to volatility in the capital markets.  Now turning the taxes, we're reducing our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to approximately 14%, driven by the net discrete tax benefits we booked for the first half of the year. So earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $7.20 per share to $7.40 per share on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.48 per share to $6.68 per share.  Q2 was certainly an atypical quarter. As I highlighted earlier, COVID impacted our financial results in a number of ways. However, our confidence in the strength of our underlying business and our demonstrated ability to overcome challenges gives us the conviction to reaffirm our robust outlook for sales growth and productivity.  So now I'll turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our ongoing efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19, a summary of key data disclosures in Q2 and a pipeline update. Thanks Seamus. So if we look at our guidance for the year and think about the margin progression in the second half of the year, just a reminder, you know sales on a constant currency basis grew 7% in the first half and our operating income percentage was a little bit over 29%. So to get to the 31% target we have for 2020, we're obviously going to see margin expansion in the second half of the year, but I think it's pretty straightforward.  When we look at the sales range that we have, you know picking midpoints or wherever you want to pick, we're looking really at something close to 7% or 8% growth in the second half of the year. So while we expect an acceleration in sort of absolute sales on a half to half basis, it's not that much of a stretch from where we are. We think a little bit of a pick-up probably in gross margin in basis points and that's just a function of more normalized geographic impact. As you know we saw more of an impact in the U.S. in the first half of the year than outside the U.S. We expect those things to normalize a little bit in the second half of the year and we're not anticipating any one-time pricing impact either up or down, so we see a little bit of a benefit there. But the big piece will come on the OpEx side. I mean it's not from additional sort of cost saving moves, you know our guidance range we provide for getting and picking wherever you want to pick in that range, a couple $100 million or so increased investment in absolute dollars in combination of SG&A and R&D in the second half of the year.  So it's really just the absolute sales benefit that we'll see in the second half against a lower absolute increase, but still an increase in OpEx. That gets us to something over 31% in the second half of the year. Put that together and that puts us at 31, because most of these things are certainly in our control.  As I mentioned earlier, and as Dan's talked about on COVID, we're going to invest fully you know behind those opportunities that is contemplated in our guidance range and to the extent we're higher on OpEx, you know at the higher end of the range, it's going to be the \u2013 primarily be because of you know seeing good data and continue to move fast there, but we're confident in the margin expansion opportunity into the second half of the year for the reasons I just mentioned. Thanks Louise. I think in the first half as I mentioned, our operating margin was 29.1%. I think if you add back some of the lost prescriptions, but then also keep in mind we had some savings associated with promotions, you know we're probably closer to 30%. We said as we came into the year, we expected margin expansion through the year. So that's still on track, but yeah we're probably off by somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points or something there. As you know Terence, we won't sort of talk specifically about individual contracts or anything at this point. But I think from what we have seen, first to go back to the earlier comments, we see a pretty similar pricing environment in 2021 to what we're seeing here, which would be modest net price decline, meeting we are providing slightly more rebates than what we're anticipating in terms of list price increases and then we couple that with the other dynamic factors that we mentioned.  I think if you think about Trulicity, we've said sort of you know expect something plus or minutes 5% net price declined over time. I think that's how we're viewing next year. It's a very competitive environment of course that we are focused on maintaining access, not looking to trade price per share or anything like that. So I think those negotiations are going as expected.  With Taltz, we've been focus on upgrading our access and so to the extent that were able to do that, you'll see that as a net price decline potentially but compensated for by increased access. Again I think we're happy with the progress we're making this year and continue to focus on improving where we can for next year. But overall, again I'd say the general trend is we have fierce competition in the classes we're in, but we're focused on maintaining at least the access we have today and you know when we have the chance upgrading in areas like immunology. Yes, so on business development our strategy hasn't changed. We continue to focus on acquiring potential first-in-class or best-in-class projects or products in our therapeutic areas. There's a high bar there and we've had great progress in our internal pipeline, but we remain committed to finding those kind of opportunities.  We have \u2013 you know we are generating very strong cash flow. We got good investment grade ratings and good liquidity, good access to capital markets. So even with all the disruption related to COVID, I don't see any change for us and then our ability to interact with you know smaller companies or access potential projects hadn't changed. That's not impacted by COVID. So it's really just a function of finding the right opportunities and ensuring that we can structure the deal in ways that create value for both sides and will continue to focus on that. Thanks. On our OID, of course in the first half of the year and particular in the second quarter as I mentioned, what we're seeing there is the mark-to-market gains from the roughly $2 billion of investment securities we hold. Again, we hold these as a function of business development deals and venture capital deals to stay abreast of breaking science and obviously making good decisions there, at least as of Q2.  We don't anticipate or we don't forecast gains going forward there. So really, if you keep that neutral Dave, what we are really thinking about then is, we are in a net debt position, so we pay interest costs on the debt and then that's the only way we see anything that's positive is if we see investment gains change.  So I think for modeling purposes, look at our sort of net debt position. We've got great rates again the debt and so it's pretty modest negative cost. But that's sort of what we assume and then you know any unusual items that flow through there, of course we'll report and we tend to just as you saw in Q2 let those upload though. But we are not anticipating anything significant in the second half of the year. So mostly you're just going to see the negative impacts of our net-debt position."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, your conference call today is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Go ahead, please.\nKevin Hern: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q1 2020 earnings call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Josh Smiley, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; and Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes. We\u2019re also joined by Sarah Smith [ph] and Mike Czapar of the Investor Relations team. In addition, I would like to welcome Anat Hakim who recently joined Lilly as Senior Vice President and General Counsel. Anat joined Lilly with a wealth of experience in the healthcare industry and more broadly across the legal profession. Her prior experiences include General Counsel of WellCare Health Plans and Associate General Counsel at Abbott as well as working for a number of years at Foley & Lardner, Latham & Watkins. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the extent and duration of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors listed on slide three, and those outlined in our latest forms 10-K, 10-Q and any 8-Ks, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the financial contribution from Elanco during 2019 and present earnings per share as though the full disposition via the exchange offer was complete on January 1, 2019. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some opening comments.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. Well, these are challenging times for all of us as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way we live, the way we conduct business and most importantly, the health and wellness of millions of people. Like all of you, we\u2019re hopeful that the decisions to implement social distancing will be effective to curb the spread of COVID-19 as our industry works urgently to enhance testing and speed therapies to market to treat and then prevent the virus. Today\u2019s call will have a different structure than normal. Before we discuss our Q1 results, we\u2019ll describe the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic in general is having on our business and the actions we\u2019ve taken to respond to the resulting global crisis. Our Q1 results were driven by very strong fundamentals with additional benefit from increased inventory across the supply chain, including at the patient level. This is as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that near-term benefit, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a negative impact on our business in the future. We expect headwinds later in 2020 and potentially beyond, such as destocking as supply chains normalize from the recent demand surge, decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patients visiting physician\u2019s offices, potential changes in segment mix in the U.S. due to rising unemployment and pricing pressures resulting from the [Technical Difficulty] on government-funded healthcare systems around the world. While we do not yet know the extent and duration of these impacts, like everyone around the world, we\u2019re hopeful that the massive mobilization of scientific and technical resources occurring across this industry and in collaboration with government and academic labs will yield multiple effective therapies in the coming months and an effective vaccine in calendar \u201821. While it\u2019s difficult to predict the specifics of how the world manages through this pandemic, it seems clear our industry will play a leading role. In the midst of the outbreak and in its aftermath, it seems equally clear that investing in research and development to address and then conquer human disease has never been more important, and this is likely to remain true for some time. As we\u2019ve navigated the crisis, we\u2019ve acted with speed and agility, focusing on the needs of patients, our employees and the communities we serve and operate in. I\u2019ll provide a summary of our response, then Dan will describe our ongoing efforts to develop a treatment for COVID-19 and Josh will walk through potential financial impact of our outlook going forward. Slide four summarizes our strategic approach and actions to-date. As you can see, we focused on five areas, maintaining a safe supply of and access to our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing a treatment for the virus; keeping our employees safe; and supporting our communities. To ensure that 40-million-plus patients we serve have access to their medicines, early in the outbreak, we took a number of steps to maintain the supply of medicines around the world. To limit their exposure to the virus, we reduced personnel at our manufacturing sites to the bare minimum required to operate our facilities and enhance already robust precautionary measures for safety and cleanliness. The majority of our supply chain is multi-sourced. And from materials we supply from one source, we keep sufficient inventory on hand to avoid disruptions. Even with increased demand and customer stocking, we have sufficient inventory and production capacity for all our products. This includes all forms of insulin. And we don\u2019t currently anticipate any issues meeting patient needs through the remainder of the pandemic. Our manufacturing sites in the U.S., Europe and China have remained operational through this crisis. We\u2019re proud of the extraordinary efforts of our manufacturing colleagues, who\u2019ve worked diligently to supply our medicines to patients around the world who depend on them. In addition to the numerous programs currently available through the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, we announced the introduction of the Insulin Value Program. This allows patients with commercial insurance or without insurance to limit their monthly out-of-pocket expenses for insulin to $35 per prescription. Of note, the Solution Center has seen a significant increase in daily calls since this new benefit was announced. Patient affordability continues to be a top priority, and we remain committed to helping people access to medicines they need. We\u2019ve also made a number of decisions which reduced the strain on the medical system. These include pausing new clinical starts and enrollment for most ongoing programs, suspending our in-person customer visits to physicians, repurposing our labs to conduct diagnostic testing here in Indiana for COVID-19, and creating a drive-thru testing facility for healthcare workers and first responders in the Indianapolis area. We took these actions because they are the right thing to do during these challenging times and to do our part to combat the spread of COVID-19. Dan will give a more complete pipeline update later, but I would like to highlight that we do not expect significant changes to the timelines for our ongoing late-stage studies, except for the previously announced delays for the GI indications of our IL-23 antibody, mirikizumab. In terms of addressing the significant unmet need of treating COVID-19, we\u2019ve acted upon several opportunities, which we hope will result in a treatment option. These include partnering with AbCellera to develop potential antibody therapies, which we expect will enter the clinic this summer, participating in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial with our JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial with an antibody targeting Angiopoietin 2 pointing to explore its potential use in reducing the progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19. The need for new medicines is urgent, and we\u2019ve mobilized our development team at a record pace. Keeping our employees safe and healthy and our Company running smoothly is of course also a top priority. We\u2019ve implemented remote work practices, added health and wellness benefits and provided additional compensation for those essential employees routinely coming to our sites, such as those in manufacturing. We\u2019ve also created opportunities for employees to volunteer during work hours to support our medical system, including helping staff, drive through testing facility. To-date, Lilly has tested nearly 30,000 people for COVID-19, which represents over a third of all tests conducted in the State of Indiana, while absorbing all associated expenses. We are building on this capacity by developing serological antibody tests that will be critical in the next phase of the pandemic. In addition, we\u2019ve been supporting our local communities by funding or contributing to public health awareness campaigns as well as providing assistance and deploying available resources to fight the pandemic. I would also note, our appreciation for the high-level of responsiveness and cooperation from the FDA and other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad as we partner together to fight COVID-19, and to minimize the negative impact to drug development timelines for our other innovative medicines. Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we\u2019re working around the clock, collectively driving forward to address the acute medical need created by the COVID-19 pandemic. And to further elaborate on that, I\u2019ll turn the call over now to Dan to provide more details on the ongoing efforts to treat COVID-19 and our regular pipeline update.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Dave. I\u2019m proud to highlight the ongoing efforts we have to combat COVID-19. As Dave mentioned earlier, we\u2019re moving at an unprecedented pace as part of an industry-wide effort to develop a treatment for COVID-19. As a scientist and as a physician, I am incredibly impressed and thankful for the ways our teams at Lilly are working to make an impact against this new disease. We\u2019ve demonstrated how nimble a large organization can be when truly focused and united behind an important cause. Slide five provides an overview of the three active therapeutic programs we are pursuing. First, is baricitinib. This is our JAK inhibitor in collaboration with Incyte. We have recently announced it is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of baricitinib, recent data in preclinical studies and case reports from investigator sponsored clinical trials, we believe baricitinib could have potential to dampen the cytokine storm that occurs when hospitalized COVID-19 patients are fighting to combat the inflammation in their lungs, which often leads to requiring a ventilator. While we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the potential of baricitinib to help treat patients with COVID-19, it\u2019s important to also note the approved rheumatoid arthritis indication includes warnings about the risk for developing serious infection. The baricitinib arm of the study begins this month in the U.S. with planned expansion to Europe and Asia and results are expected in the next two months. Next, we started a Phase 2 trial with a monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2 or Ang2 in pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. The Ang2 level in plasma is strongly correlated to the ARDS risk and severity, based on multiple studies in humans. Our trial we\u2019ll test with our inhibiting the effects of Ang2 with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to ARDS or the need for mechanical ventilation. This trial has already begun enrolling patients at centers across the United States. We expect results from this trial in the coming months. Our third and potentially most significant program is part of our previously announced collaboration with AbCellera, where we are pursuing antibody therapies for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Our scientists have been working together with AbCellera, NIH and academic partners to characterize virus-neutralizing antibodies obtained from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from the virus. The most advanced antibody in this program shows potent neutralization of live virus, and has now entered GMP manufacturing. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA by the end of May, to allow start of clinical testing in patients. The pace at which we\u2019ve advanced these potential treatments has been possible through the tireless efforts of our research and development colleagues, in partnership with a number of private and government partners. The need for treatment options to battle COVID-19 is staggering, and we are leveraging our financial resources and our very significant scientific capabilities to rapidly pursue solutions. The challenges facing our society and our economy are great, and the pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge. I\u2019ll now provide a brief pipeline update. Slide six shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes the approval of Lyumjev in the EU and Japan, the U.S. approval of Taltz for pediatric psoriasis and previously mentioned COVID-19 trial initiations for baricitinib and Ang2, one program advancing to Phase 1, the attrition of an early phase project, and the removal of empagliflozin for type 1 diabetes, based on a complete response letter from the FDA. Moving to slide seven, we provide an update on our 2020 key events that have occurred during the quarter. In addition to previously mentioned approvals, we also announced the first of two Phase 3 trials studying mirikizumab in psoriasis met its primary endpoints, the submission of tanezumab in Europe for moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain in collaboration with Pfizer, the DIAN-TU trail for solanezumab, which did not meet its primary endpoint, and galcanezumab received a negative opinion from the CHMP for cluster headache in Europe. Before I close the R&D update, I\u2019d like to emphasize that in addition to our ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19, we remain committed to advancing important new medicines across our entire portfolio. Although, we announced our pause to new trial starts and enrollment in most programs, we remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments for the patients we serve. With the exception of mirikizumab for GI indications, our late-stage portfolio remains on track to deliver important clinical trial data, in line with our previously communicated timelines. Of note, the tirzepatide SURPASS program in type 2 diabetes is fully enrolled, and we expect to share the first Phase 3 trial results later this year. These are challenging times around the world. But, I\u2019m encouraged by the unprecedented response to the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry to rapidly develop potential new treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 and to sustain advancements across all diseases. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Josh to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 financial performance and our outlook going forward.\nJosh Smiley: Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. As Dave shared earlier, we are confident that our business fundamentals are strong and that we\u2019re well positioned to navigate the obstacles ahead. However, there undoubtedly will be a near term impact to our industry and our company. So, the length and magnitude of the effects are uncertain. So, I\u2019ll spend a few minutes discussing the financial impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 performance, and providing a framework for how we are thinking about this potential impact going forward, before then providing a more detailed review of our financial results. We began 2020, with positive momentum and observed robust prescription trends in January and February. As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world and economic activity slows significantly in many cities and regions, we observed the following changes and behaviors that affected our business. Patients refilled existing prescriptions earlier than normal or bought a larger supply to ensure that they didn\u2019t run out. Wholesalers and retailers increased the level of inventory on hand to ensure adequate supply. Reduced hospital visits resulted in a preference for medicines that do not require administration in a physician\u2019s office or the hospital. Patients abandoned fewer prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. Mail order utilization increased, which typically has a larger number of units per prescription in those filled at retail pharmacies, and new therapy starts slowed as patients largely avoided hospitals and clinics unless they were seeking treatment for COVID-19. We estimate, the net impact of these trends resulted in increased patient and channel stocking, which increased worldwide sales by roughly $250 million in Q1 with approximately $200 million of that impact in the U.S. We think the majority of the U.S. impact occurred in our diabetes portfolio and notable products, where we believe increased stocking impacted our Q1 U.S. results include, insulins by approximately $70 million to $80 million, Trulicity by approximately $30 million to $40 million, and Taltz by approximately $20 million to $25 million. While we expect much of this stocking to reverse in future quarters as the excess supply in the channel and in patients\u2019 medicine cabinets is consumed, the timing and ultimate levels are uncertain. We continue to closely monitor these factors and will utilize our quarterly earnings calls to provide update to our outlook. Slide eight lists a number of factors we are monitoring that may impact our financial performance. While reduced new therapy starts had a negligible impact during Q1, this impact could grow in future periods as fewer new starts translate into fewer total prescriptions. In the U.S., we are starting to see an impact as IQVIA reported new-to-brand prescriptions across the industry declined by 42% for the week ending April 10th versus pre-COVID-19 averages. For our portfolio, we anticipate this impact to be more pronounced to our immunology and pain products and less so for oncology and diabetes. However, we expect this impact to be temporary as patients will return to seeing their doctors as social distancing restrictions are lifted. Over the midterm, the significant increase in unemployment we are seeing could be a headwind. Increased unemployment may result in a shift of patients from commercial insurance to lower net price government insurance in the U.S. or to being uninsured. We\u2019re monitoring this dynamic closely. And while it could create headwinds in the near-term, this effect should lessen when the global economy eventually strengthens. Given the significant benefits our products provide to 40 million patients around the world, we remain competent in our long-term outlook for revenue growth and margin expansion. In terms of managing capital, our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and we have investment grade ratings from both Moody\u2019s and S&P. We\u2019re confident in our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and have not seen an impact to our ability to access capital markets, including commercial paper at reasonable rates. Financial strength is a valuable asset during this period and we intend to maintain our current credit ratings, while using our balance sheet capacity to invest in the business and pursue business development opportunities and enhance our future growth prospects. I\u2019ll provide more details on our 2020 outlook shortly, but in summary, we do expect the impacts on our financial results through the remainder of the year and potentially into 2021, but the underlying strength and momentum in our business is strong. While combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority, we remain focused on executing our strategy of developing new medicines for patients. We exited 2019 with very strong momentum in revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by the uptake of our newer products. On slide nine, you\u2019ll see that momentum continued in Q1 2020 as we delivered strong underlying business performance augmented by the estimated COVID-19-related buying patterns from patients and customers I just described. Revenue growth accelerated in Q1, increasing 15% versus Q1 2019 or 16% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by volume, which contributed 22 percentage points of growth. Net of the estimated COVID-19 impact, revenue growth was 11% for the quarter in constant currency. Our newer medicines continue to be the driver of this growth, representing more than half of our revenue in the quarter. We\u2019ve made good progress in Q1 on our productivity agenda as operating income grew 32% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 390 basis points to 30.1% as revenue growth outpaced operating expenses. The estimated impact of COVID-19 buying patterns on the quarter also had a positive impact on our non-GAAP operating margin. But, as we discussed during our 2020 financial guidance call, we expect our 2020 operating margin to build throughout the year to achieve our 2020 target for the full year of 31%. We\u2019ve announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q4 2019 earnings call, including approval of Lyumjev in Europe and Japan, and new indications for both Trulicity and Taltz in the U.S. During Q1, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and the dividend. As previously announced, we increased the dividend by 15% for 2020. At this point, we do not expect to make additional share repurchases in the near term, in order to maintain a cushion of liquidity and capacity for investment and continued dividend growth. Finally, we closed the acquisition of Dermira, a company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions, enhancing our Phase 3 pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab, which is complementary to our dermatology business. Slide 10 includes the summary of key events since our last earnings call. Moving to slide 11, our non-GAAP financial performance in Q1 was robots, even when adjusting for the COVID-19 impact described earlier. In addition to strong top-line performance, gross margin as a percent of revenue was stable versus Q1 2019 at approximately 80% as favorable product mix and greater manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by price and increased costs associated with COVID-19. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew slower than revenue at 7% versus last year\u2019s quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased modestly by 2%, as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. Travel restrictions and the suspension of in-person customer interactions late in the quarter, did result in lower travel and meeting expenses. However, it is offset by a higher U.S. branded prescription drug manufacturing fee that we recognized in Q1. R&D expenses grew 13%, reflecting higher development expenses for late-stage assets that increased throughout 2019. Our pause on clinical trial starts had limited impact in Q1. Operating income increased 32% compared to Q1 2019 as sales growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 30.1% for the quarter. We begin 2020 with good momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full-year operating margin target of 31%. Other income and expenses was income of $89 million this quarter compared to income of $86 million in Q1 2019. In both quarters, this was driven by investment gains on public equities. Mark-to-market gains in Q1 2020, were primarily generated by prior equity investments in companies that are now pursuing vaccines for COVID-19. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.6%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in net discreet tax benefits. So, at the bottom line, earnings per share increased 32%. On slide 12, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 16% in constant currency during Q1, driven by strong volume growth of 22%, which we estimate at 17% net of the impact of COVID-19 buying patterns. This was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth this quarter. Price declined 3% net of the price impact from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government-sponsored programs in China. U.S. revenue grew 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 19% was led by Trulicity, Humalog, Taltz, Alimta, Verzenio, Emgality, and Basaglar. As I mentioned earlier, we saw stocking at the wholesale and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of revenues this quarter. While the situation remains fluid, we do expect this impact to largely reverse over the course of 2020. Pricing was a 4% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, in line with our 2020 guidance. This was driven primarily by growth in lower price segment, primarily driven by our diabetes products, which was partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts recalls and reduced utilization of patient assistance programs for Emgality due to increased commercial reimbursement. We have strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and have remained intact throughout Q1. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 21% in constant currency, driven by 24% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio and also benefited from the divestiture of a legacy product in Spain. We estimate total international results were impacted by approximately $50 million of stocking due to the impact of COVID-19 in Q1 and the significant majority of this occurred in Europe. However, the underlying trends are very strong, as our newer products have continued to scale. In Japan, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by volume growth, somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019. Verzenio, Cyramza, Trulicity, Olumiant and Alimta were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by increased competition from Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency, driven by 93% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions associated with the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. We\u2019re very pleased with the significant volume increases we saw for these products and our ability to increase access for patients disease to these important cancer medicines. Outside of Tyvyt and Alimta, our business in China saw a meaningful decline in new patients starts during Q1 as the COVID-19 spread peaked during March. As the situation appears to be moving toward more stability, we are cautiously encouraged that new patient initiation and in-person customer interactions have begun to resume. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers, Trulicity, Jardiance in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, Taltz, Cialis and Cyramza drove growth in Q1. As shown on slide 13, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 20 percentage points of growth this quarter, while also benefiting from the increased stocking that I described earlier. Slide 14 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 51% of total revenue. On slide 15, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2020, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We remain well-capitalized and closed Q1 with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments, and the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. Moving to slide 16, you\u2019ll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on our best estimate at this time as we\u2019re balancing transparency and insight into the current view of our business with the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include the Q1 stocking benefit largely reverses over the course of 2020; the near-term reduction in new patient prescriptions, peaks in the second quarter in the U.S. and much of Europe; healthcare activity returns to more normal levels in the second half of this year, as doctors resume seeing new patients; price headwinds from the increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased us unemployment; and enrollment in existing studies, as well as the initiation of new clinical trials resumes midyear; and near-term spending on travel, in-person customer interactions and direct consumer advertising decreases and investments in digital promotion and support increases. We do believe the reduction in new patient starts will be temporary, but will impact our 2020 performance. The potential impact from increased unemployment will likely be more muted in the near term, but the impact could be more pronounced in 2021, depending on the shape of an economic recovery and the U.S. government programs to stimulate employment. While the extended duration of impact from COVID-19 drives the most uncertainty in our outlook, the positive underlying momentum in Q1 in our business augmented by the addition -- the estimated additional revenue benefit from COVID-19 related buying patterns, gives us confidence that the potential downside for the remainder of the year is accommodated within our previously community revenue range. While there are scenarios that could cause revenue to fall outside either end of our range, we believe the revenue range accommodates most of the uncertainty we see today. In addition to the impact of unemployment and the pace of economic recovery described earlier, the main variables we will monitor are the impact on new prescription trends during social distancing period, and the timing of resumption of non-COVID-19 healthcare activities. While we currently anticipate the most pronounced impact on new prescriptions to occur in Q2, the headwinds are likely to show up in Q3 and Q4 as inventory levels normalize, and the impact of pure new prescriptions compound. Moving down the income statement, we\u2019re confirming our prior expectations for gross margin as a percent of revenue to be roughly 81% on a non-GAAP basis and 79% on a GAAP basis. We do anticipate higher manufacturing costs associated with the extraordinary measures we are taking to keep our manufacturing workers safe and to keep medicines flowing to patients around the world. We expect this to be offset though by benefits from higher manufacturing volumes. We\u2019re maintaining a range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses as savings from reduced travel and decreased promotion are anticipated to be offset by investments in digital capabilities and increased marketing expenses in the second half of the year for key growth products. Our range for research and development expenses is also unchanged as savings from the pause to clinical trial activity are offset by our investments to pursue therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, as Dan described earlier. Therefore, there\u2019s no change to our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue guidance of 31%. We\u2019re updating the range of other income and expense to 0 to $150 million of expense, reflecting Q1 gains in our equity portfolio. Obviously, this number has some volatility going forward and we\u2019ll update accordingly. Turning to taxes. There\u2019s no change to our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance of approximately 15%. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90 on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. We are increasing the range to reflect the uncertainty of the impact to our business for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the first quarter, net of COVID-19 benefit, highlights the strength of our underlying business fundamentals. And as Dave mentioned in his introduction, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business. So Dave, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Josh. The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted us all in unforeseen ways. Although near-term challenges exist, we do remain confident in our long-term outlook for the Company and the strength of our fundamentals. The times of great crisis can bring out the best in people and in companies. And Lilly will continue to rise to that challenge. While a great deal of uncertainty remains, there are few certainties to which I would draw your attention. First, the collective spirit, expertise and commitment of my Lilly colleagues around the world is inspiring. Despite challenging circumstances and disrupted work routines, they\u2019ve rallied to fulfill our mission of discovering and supplying medicines that make life better for people around the world. They are exceptional. Second, speed and agility continue to be critical to the success of our business. We\u2019ve moved swiftly, pivoting our focus to join the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging our deep scientific capabilities and expertise on both the testing and therapeutic fronts. And lastly, I\u2019ve never been more certain of the importance of a healthy and vibrant biopharmaceutical industry. While it will take time to exit the current situation, we will recover. And the pharmaceutical industry will be the primary catalyst, developing new treatments and a vaccine to combat COVID-19, allowing people across the world to return to living their lives more normally and enabling economic activity to grow. It\u2019s clear, we are a vital part of any long-term solution for fighting this or any future pandemic. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. We\u2019d like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Alan, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session. And then,, we\u2019re ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first I was just wondering, Josh, if you could expand on how the environment changes your approach to capital allocation. I know you mentioned, maybe less share repurchases in near term. But on the BD M&A side, do you actually think there could be an increasing number of opportunities? And does it change how you think about size? And then, the second I had was just where you stand with regulatory interactions in launch prep for selpercatinib. Just wondering if COVID changes at all your go-to-market strategy. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Terence. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first one and then Anne for the question on selpercatinib.\nJosh Smiley: Hi, Terrence. Thanks. On capital allocation, we really are sticking to our strategy. And as we\u2019ve outlined, we do see external innovation or business development as a key component of our long-term growth strategy. But, what we\u2019re really focused on -- continue to focus on are key opportunities in our therapeutic areas where we can bring in first or best-in-class type of assets into the pipeline. We\u2019re continuing -- I think that work continues. I haven\u2019t seen anything slow down as a function of not being able to travel or work from home types of activities. Certainly, there are a smaller biotech companies that may have different views in terms of their cash runway or ease. And to the extent that that helps to engender more discussions, we\u2019ll take advantage of that. I don\u2019t think it changes anything in terms of how we think about size, our business is strong, as I mentioned, and we don\u2019t see benefits in large scale types of acquisition. So, we\u2019ll continue to focus on the things that we are focused on. And I think for as long as we\u2019re in these kinds of social distancing restrictions, I don\u2019t see that as impacting our ability to transact.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Anne?\nAnne White: Yes. Terence, thanks for the question on selpercatinib. So, I\u2019m pleased to share that there\u2019s been no delay in the regulatory timeline for selpercatinib. And the FDA has been extremely collaborative and responsive in working through these challenges, time. So, we just thank them for the speed and the commitment they\u2019ve had. They continue to progress the application. And as you know, we submitted in December, it\u2019s currently under priority review. So, we expect to have regulatory action by the PDUFA date in Q3. Regarding your questions on launch, it is interesting times, obviously. And as a Company, as Dave shared, we continue to prioritize combating the spread of coronavirus, and we recognize that this is also the case for healthcare professionals, and we\u2019re incredibly aware of the load that they\u2019re carrying at this time and need to express our appreciation for all of their efforts on behalf of their patients. So, with that, we also though recognize that selpercatinib has shown striking efficacy and really a very favorable safety profile in treating lung and thyroid cancers with RET fusions or RET mutations. And so, we think it\u2019s still very important that patients and physicians are aware that there\u2019s a new medicine available, and the first to specifically target RET alterations. So, what we\u2019re doing with launch activity is they will look different. But we\u2019re committed to making sure that patients who are good candidates for selpercatinib have access. So, assuming that in-person interactions are still on hold when we launch, we\u2019re going to focus initially on making sure that we inform customers of the approval and the key efficacy and safety data via email and other digital channels that we have. We\u2019re also going to make sure that we\u2019re quick to engage in virtual product details when the customer requests those and give them more information. And then, when appropriate, we\u2019re also going to make sure that we leverage virtual peer to peer programs to provide thought leaders the opportunity to share the data with their colleagues. And in addition, of course, we\u2019ll be sharing the data through a top tier journal publication, as well as in upcoming medical meetings. So, we\u2019ll make sure that the -- the goal here is to make sure that physicians and patients are aware and informed that we have now an incredible new medicine that\u2019s specifically targeted for RET. And it\u2019s just been an incredible partnership with Loxo and Lilly teams. If you think about it, this medicine started Phase 1, first patient dosed in May of 2017, and we\u2019re looking at approval here in 2020. So, it\u2019s remarkable. And our thanks really goes to the FDA for the speed at which they\u2019re moving through the review.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line -- one moment, please. [Operator Instructions] We are restarting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] My apologies to everyone on the conference call. We\u2019ll move next to the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much and I appreciate all the color on the call today. Just my two questions. First on disruption to near-term prescription. You mentioned diabetes as an area less impacted relative to areas like pain and immunology. But, I do have a specific question on Trulicity. I guess, when I think about that product and the GLP-1 category in general, we\u2019ve been seeing very healthy growth here. We\u2019re seeing significant new patient starts. Is it a product and a market maybe more broadly that you anticipate could see a slowdown as we go through 2Q as the impact of some of the reduced physician visits start to build? And then, my second question was on payer mix over time. Could you just help us frame the magnitude of impact you could see to net price in the U.S. from adverse payer mix as we look out over the next year or so? I guess, specifically, is this something that could cause price to meaningfully deviate from this low-single-digit price erosion we\u2019re seeing? So, could that become more like a mid to high-single-digit erosion or you think you\u2019ve got a more modest impact than that? Thanks very much.\nKevin Hern: Thank you, Chris. We\u2019ll go to Mike Mason for the question on Trulicity, and then Josh, the question on payer mix.\nMike Mason: Okay. On Trulicity, it\u2019s difficult to predict long-term impact of the COVID-19 crisis, given the uncertainty on the length and the impact on economy and patient visits. And also, it\u2019s unclear how patients who live with diabetes, who are at greater risk for complications from COVID-19, will that change the compliance that they have with the medication and increase that. But, what I can tell you is little over a month into the crisis that the GLP market and Trulicity TRX volume remain strong. It\u2019s currently at 30%. And so, we haven\u2019t seen the impact at the TRx level yet. We have seen the impact on NTS and NBRx volume kind of post-COVID, both for Trulicity and the GLP market. Josh has shared that the overall pharma market has seen a decline of 42% in NBRx. What we\u2019re seeing in the GLP market is a 30% decline for NBRx. Now, we haven\u2019t seen that manifest itself in the TRx volume yet. If you take a look at the NPRx and for Trulicity, it\u2019s only 5.6% of the TRx rate, which is a relatively low turnover for the marketplace. So, we think that, Trulicity relative to other products, other therapeutic areas will have kind of a slower impact from the COVID situation. But again, it\u2019s hard to predict as we have uncertainty on the length of the impact of the economy and patient visits. What we can say is that we\u2019re very confident in Trulicity\u2019s strong fundamentals. We saw 32% volume growth in Q1 and 40% revenue growth in Q1. So, we\u2019re very confident in the very-strong fundamentals of Trulicity. So, Chris, thanks for the question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Chris. On your question on what could happen to net price going forward given what we\u2019re seeing in the in the U.S. with the economy, first, I think it\u2019s too early to make too many predictions. There\u2019s a lot to still see. And as you highlighted in your question, we\u2019ve already assumed that we\u2019re going to see negative net prices in the U.S. for -- between now and 2025. That\u2019s already in our current guidance. So, I would see whatever happens here is probably a moderate impact on that. I think, what we have to keep in mind first for Lily\u2019s portfolio, we\u2019re spread across multiple payer segments. Certainly, in general, a move from a well-insured commercial patient to Medicaid is a net negative. But, many of the commercial patients, it\u2019s my assumption, who are losing -- in the first wave, losing employment, they may not be in great commercial plans to begin with their exchanges and other things. So, there\u2019s a lot to still see what happens here. Our view is, we\u2019ll ensure that the patients who are losing insurance have access to our medications and programs. We, as Dave mentioned, announced the $35 change to our diabetes program. So, we\u2019re looking at everything we can do to ensure that people can stay on our medications and have access to them, and believe that some of these impacts will be temporary and then we\u2019ll have a much better sense by the end of the year on what 2021 looks like. But, I\u2019d say, overall, our expectation is this continues the trend, the net price declines, but not a fundamental change to our thinking about the business.\nOperator: We will move next to the line of Andrew Baum with Citi. Go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Same topic. You have a high exposure relative to your peers to the commercial book. For your full year guidance, could you help us on what kinds of U.S. unemployment rates you\u2019re assuming, as well as some magnitude of the volume loss and potential Medicaid expansion, anything you can say about the rest of the 2021? And then, separately, on Olumiant baricitinib COVID-19. I\u2019m just trying to understand, which patient population you\u2019re targeting. The literature talks to both a potential antiviral effect, as well as an anti-inflammatory effect, which would suggest potentially two different patient populations, the earlier then respiratory distress. Where you\u2019re going here with the clinical trials? Many thanks.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Dan on bari \u201819 COVID.\nJosh Smiley: Thank you, Andrew. I think, as it relates to 2020, our sales guidance range on the -- I described sort of the factors we\u2019re looking at. I\u2019d say, if we\u2019re on the lower end of that sales range, we do include in our thinking there some incremental impact from pricing. Again, I think it\u2019d probably be pretty muted this year. And then, I think we\u2019ll just have to look and see what next year looks like. And I think it\u2019s not just absolute levels of unemployment, it\u2019s what programs are in place to bridge the gap and otherwise. So, this year, again, I think our range, given the strong position we\u2019re starting from Q1, our range accommodates potential incremental pricing impacts for potentially short-term moves to insurance or Medicaid. But I think at this point, it\u2019s a little early to have -- rollout specifics around this one.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thank Andrew for the question on baricitinib and mechanism of action and potential on COVID-19. You\u2019re right in your comments about a potential for a dual mechanism of action for baricitinib. I think first publication on the potential role of baricitinib in COVID-19 came from a group called BenevolentAI where they modeled out that the effects both, on viral entry and on inflammatory response could be beneficial in this disease. The trial that we discussed that is the Adaptive COVID-19 trial with NIAID is in hospitalized patients. So, it\u2019s rather later in the disease progression. And the design of the trial is primarily to look at the effects of baricitinib on that inflammatory cascade. It\u2019s notable that that trial currently is conceived of as a factorial design with remdesivir. Of course, in addition to look at the clinical outcomes of these patients with viral load, and other factors will also be evaluated. I think, if we see success there, that could give us confidence to go earlier in the disease course. But, given sort of the mixed mechanism action here, right now, we\u2019re looking at those hospitalized patients.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will come from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.\nDavid Risinger: Yes. Thanks very much. So, I have two questions. First, in the event that baricitinib and/or the Ang2 succeed in June, what are the next steps? Would you be filing for approval at that time? And then, with respect to the Ang2, could you just discuss the manufacturing capacity and the amount of volume you could produce later this year? And then, second, with respect to clinical trials, when do you expect to restart enrollment in the majority of your trials? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. Dave, we\u2019ll go to Dan for both of those.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Dave. So, starting out with the expectations for what if any of our molecules are successful in COVID-19. Baricitinib is probably the most straightforward to answer. It\u2019s a small molecule that can be produced at large capacity and it\u2019s already approved in geographies around the world for rheumatoid arthritis. So, depending on the quality of the data and the benefit risks that we see in COVID-19 patients, you could expect that could potentially move very, very quickly, if it\u2019s successful. Ang2 is sort of the opposite end of the spectrum. This is investigational monoclonal antibody, production is more constrained and lead times are longer, and this is a Phase 2 type trial. I think though, the one that we\u2019re most focused on, which you didn\u2019t directly ask about in your question, is the neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. I think, that\u2019s where we see a relatively high probability of technical success, given success with neutralizing antibodies against other viruses, and also given what we\u2019ve seen pre-clinically with our project. And that\u2019s also one where you can imagine a broad treatment paradigm. Antibodies like this are likely not only to work in sick patients, but could potentially have a prophylactic use, which then sort of demands large quantities. I think, in all of these programs, you just also note that these aren\u2019t chronic therapies. They\u2019re one time use or short period of time in a case of baricitinib. But still, I think for the antibody, we\u2019re working very diligently to expand our manufacturing capacity that would be ready to deploy, both internally and with partnerships, if the neutralizing antibodies are successful. We\u2019re making those investments in advance. I mentioned, we started GMP manufacturing already at our facilities to support the clinical trials and we\u2019re prepared to scale quite rapidly, if we see a positive signal with a neutralizing antibody. Your second question was on clinical trial restart timelines. I think, it\u2019s important to think about the context for why we stopped enrolling new patients and starting new clinical trials. It wasn\u2019t so much a problem with our ability to maintain the clinical trials. In fact, I\u2019m quite confident -- even more confident today than I would have been a month ago, in our ability to meet all of our sponsor obligations, our ability to deliver drug to sites, or even directly to patients, where it\u2019s needed to measure outcomes either at the sites or by other means directly with patients. So, I\u2019m really confident in our ability to carry out the trials. It\u2019s a desire to relieve the sites and hospitals of the burden of running clinical trials. So, we\u2019re watching our clinical trial sites carefully, many of them are already starting to ask the same question you are when they can restart. We\u2019ll make decisions along with them based on the burden of COVID-19 that they\u2019re having and how much time and attention they can devote to clinical trials.\nOperator: Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim. Go ahead, please.\nSeamus Fernandez: A couple here. There\u2019s a -- HMA is a consulting group that estimates the sort of medical -- Medicaid enrollment increases. So, I guess, if -- I was just hoping that you guys could put a little bit more granularity around your estimates for expectations for Medicaid enrollment. This group estimates that Medicaid enrollment could increase by 11 to 23 million, uninsured could increase by 10 to 11 million. And just maybe if you can just help us put a little context around the percent of volume -- of Lilly\u2019s volume that flows into Medicaid currently, versus the percent of sales that flows into Medicaid currently, and just I think help us understand a little bit of the context in that regard. And then, the second question for Dan. Dan, I think we were expecting the Phase 2 Alzheimer\u2019s data in the second half of this year for the NGC antibody. Could you just update us on that and how that\u2019s progressing? Is that still expected in the second half of this year, or should we anticipate that in sort of a 2021 timeframe? Just an update there would be great. Thanks so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We\u2019ll go to Josh for the first question and then Dan for your question on donanemab readout.\nJosh Smiley: Sure. Thanks, Seamus. In terms of -- across our entire portfolio, in the U.S., about 10% of our volume is Medicaid right now, about 40% is commercial insurance, 20% Part D, and then the rest is Part B or hospital-based or uninsured or other types of volumes. As we talked about before, I think the biggest sort of challenge would be a really well insured commercial patient moving to Medicaid. There are a lot of steps in between those things happening. As I mentioned, in the prior question, we are anticipating in our sale guidance for 2020 that we could see some net impact as a function of that. But again, I would say, it\u2019s -- and we\u2019ve looked at all those estimates and in terms of what the long-term look could be. And we\u2019ll provide more updates on that for 2021 when we have a better sense. But again, I\u2019d say that our sales guidance right now does accommodate the fact that we may see some near-term moves to increase Medicaid or increase uninsured.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks Seamus for the question on our Alzheimer\u2019s Phase 2 portfolio. You asked specifically about the donanemab, our anti N3pG-a beta antibody. This is a really robust plaque clearing antibody. We know it can clear plaques to quite a great extent and quite quickly as well. It\u2019s an 18-month Phase 2 study designed to demonstrate efficacy in a relatively large and homogenous population of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. This study is fully enrolled. It\u2019s proceeding along the previously communicated timelines, which means that last patient visit will be in the end of this year, as you said. And most likely then, we\u2019ll have a data to talk about shortly after that, although probably in January rather than December. But, no changes to our timelines on that trial. Similarly, the tau antibody as well as our symptomatic D1 PAM, those are all Phase 2 studies designed for efficacy, similarly fully enrolled and moving along the previously communicated timeline. So, no change in the Alzheimer\u2019s portfolio there.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: That will be Steve Scala from Cowen. Go ahead.\nSteve Scale: Good morning. Thank you. It was mentioned that most clinical programs are paused for new starts. A couple of questions related to this. First, I realize that every trial is different. But generally speaking, how long will pause have to last to impact the long-term outlook for Lilly\u2019s sales vision, say through 2025? And then, second, according to clinicaltrials.gov, only 5 of 155 Lilly trials that are actively recruiting have had recruitment status changed in the last five weeks. Just wondering about this relative to what you said and what the release said. I believe companies are obligated to reflect any changes within 30 days. So, I\u2019m just curious why really no changes have been reflected. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Hey, Steve. We\u2019ll go to Dan for both of those questions.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Thanks, Steve, for those questions. So, the first question was just about, like how long does the delay and your enrollment have to be before it starts to impact our long-term financials? Look, I think, you know very well that clinical trial timelines and enrollment timelines are often estimates. We give those rounded usually to the half a year or sometimes just calendar year. So, for now, you can think of these as a worst case scenario being a day-to-day delay. So, for every day that were paused enrollment, it\u2019s a stay delay to when we get the data. Now, our ambition is to beat that. And there\u2019s a couple of reasons why we think we can do that. There\u2019s sort of a latent demand to be in these clinical trials that\u2019s accumulating. So, when we put the switch again to allow enrollment, we think we\u2019ll see both, the patients and be able to make up some lost time on enrollment. That\u2019s one of the reasons. Another reason why we can even make up some time and be better than day-by-day is the fact that we can stagger our enrollment in different geographies, not everywhere in the world is similarly affected by COVID-19. So, while our comments on pausing enrollment might apply to the majority of our geographies, there could also be certain countries where we continue to enroll or even shift enrollment more to those countries. As for the clinicaltrials.gov updating, you\u2019re right that there\u2019s a time lag in that update. There\u2019s also a time lag really in stopping enrollment because you can imagine that although we say no new enrollment, there are patients who could be part of the way through screening and on a case-by-case, trial-by-trial, geography-by-geography basis. We often allow those patients who are already undergoing study procedures to continue those procedures and enrolling in a trial. So, it takes a little bit of time for all this to trickle through the system. But, I\u2019m as I said earlier, looking forward to the day when we can turn these back on when hospitals and clinical trial sites have gotten beyond the burden of treating COVID-19 patients.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Steve, for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will be Navin Jacob with UBS. Go ahead.\nNavin Jacob: Just on Trulicity, if I may. Sorry to beat a dead horse here. But, I want to understand, relative to the negative 5% price pressure that you have guided to in the U.S., how we should be thinking about that now. And related to that is -- I know you\u2019ve spoken about or spoken to insulins being barely profitable in Medicaid channel. Is that true for Trulicity as well? I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s not as onerous as it is for insulins if that switch were to happen. But just any kind of color would be helpful with regards to Trulicity. And then, just a quick question, if I may on Taltz, looks quite strong. You also mentioned changes in rebates and discounts. Any kind of color around pricing for Taltz as well would be helpful.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Navin. We\u2019ll go to Josh for both of these price-related questions on Trulicity and Taltz.\nJosh Smiley: Thanks, Navin. First, our outlook at the beginning of the year for U.S. price was net declines in the low single digits. And, as I mentioned, in the range that we\u2019re looking at now, I think we\u2019re still in the low single digits that that could add in the more pessimistic case, maybe that adds a point or something but it\u2019s still in the same range. To your question specifically about products, what we said is insulins are not profitable in Medicaid. We pay in effect 100% rebates for patients who are on our mealtime insulins in Medicaid. So, that\u2019s a place where you see a real challenge I think if -- to the extent that the patients are moving from commercial insurance to Medicaid. On Trulicity, it\u2019s less of an issue. It\u2019s still net positive but Medicaid just in general is a lower price segment than commercial plan. But it wouldn\u2019t be as big of a move as it would be for our commercially insured mealtime insulin patients. On Trulicity, I think, we\u2019ve highlighted through the last few years that Trulicity access is not as strong as it is for the rest of our portfolio. And what we do in many cases is Trulicity patients have to step through various PAs or restrictions in their plan. We make estimates on our utilization on how things are going to transpire there. What we found in Q1 is we were actually getting more net price for a segment of our patients than we had estimated. So, we\u2019ve got a little bit of a benefit there. I think, for the year, we\u2019re still sort of assuming the same that we maintain a kind of access that we have now at relatively constant prices. And you\u2019ll see these ups and downs and it\u2019s a little bit challenging in Taltz for the reason that I mentioned. You\u2019ll see sort of the quarterly ups and downs. But, the underlying trend that we see is pretty stable pricing, pretty stable access.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Navin, Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will be Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open. [Operator Instructions] All right. Thank you. Next question will be from Umer Raffat with Evercore. One moment, please.\nUmer Raffat: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I hope everyone is staying safe. There has been some concern about GIP safety after European paper. And I just thought it would be helpful if you could speak to the Blinded CV event rate you\u2019re seeing across your Phase 3 program and whether it\u2019s in line with what you would\u2019ve expected? And secondly, I know Josh, you\u2019ve gotten only 25 questions on it, so let me just ask the 26th one. You mentioned pretty stable pricing in the diabetes business. Can you speak to whether patients in high-deductible private plans still produce the same net price for Lilly as those in Medicaid? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Umer. We\u2019ll go to Dan around GIP safety and then Josh for pricing.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks Umer for the question. Surely, you\u2019re referring to sort of a small epidemiological study that looked at a risk of GIP polymorphisms. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s directly applicable to what we\u2019re seeing with tirzepatide. Here, we\u2019re studying this in a population that has diabetes. And we know from our Phase 2 trials that the physiological effects of tirzepatide, which obviously is combined GIP and GLP, are quite beneficial, and they look like they would have a strong effect on improving cardiovascular outcomes. So, we\u2019re super confident about that. In terms of the blinded event rates in ongoing studies, that\u2019s not something that we disclose or talk about. But, certainly though the rate of those events is the rate limiting factor in our submission. So, that\u2019s a long tail in our submission is waiting to get enough events to discharge any cardiovascular safety risks, so we can we can submit tirzepatide.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Hi, Umer. Thanks for the question. And I think you are building on one of the comments I made, which was, I don\u2019t think you can just look at sort of a move from commercial to Medicaid. It\u2019s very much driven by plan dynamics and otherwise. And I think without getting into too much detail, yes, it is fair to say that patients in high deductible plans, when they\u2019re in that deductible phase, you know that we and other pharmaceutical companies have copay cards and other things to try to alleviate sort of the cash burden at the retail pharmacy. So, we do -- the net price for those specific prescriptions to us is very low and probably in many cases could be lower than a Medicaid prescription. But again, I think that gets back to what I was saying earlier, I think it\u2019s way too premature to make assumptions around what a move from commercial to Medicaid may look like. There are lots of complexities here and I think lots of things still to be learned about the economy and what 2021 will look like. But, it\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not as I think on a mass basis as concerned as probably it looks like when you just look at just general commercial to a Medicaid for one of the reasons that you are sort of implying in your question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: We will return to the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America. Go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Josh, a number of P&L questions for you. You quantified the pull forward COVID impact for a few products. Just wanted to ask you, are those things kind of happening today in the U.S. and do you expect the OUS dynamic to eventually mirror the U.S.? And then on your guidance, would you expect normalization of the market to be more of a 3Q or 4Q type of event? And then real quick, Dave, you highlighted at the end, but how would you characterize your discussion with policymakers today versus the beginning of the year, just with respect to headwinds on drug pricing and clearly industry response to COVID having somewhat of a halo effect?\nJosh Smiley: So, just on the $250 million, we estimated in Q1, as we mentioned, about $200 million are added in the U.S., and we talked about the three big product categories. I think, the rest -- the product I didn\u2019t mention is sort of spread nominally among those others. As we look at that $200 million in the U.S., only -- less than a third of that is at the wholesale -- wholesaler level. So, we saw some modest build at the wholesaler. Most of that estimate we\u2019re making is either in the retail channel or all the way down to patients -- in patients\u2019 homes. So, I think it\u2019s going to be pretty difficult. I mean, we\u2019re assuming that that will turn around. But, I think being able to sort of make a prediction at this point is top, I would assume the wholesaler piece will start to normalize more quickly and I think we\u2019re seeing that. The retail and patient piece I think will be -- some of it will be a function of what happens in social distancing otherwise, and some of it, who knows, it may be a little bit more -- have a long tail associated with that. What we saw in Europe, there was about $50 million. And I think most of the estimate is around our diabetes portfolio. And I think that one we probably assume is a little more likely to normalize in the second half of this year. So, I think Geoff, we\u2019ll try to be transparent about this as we move through the quarter. But, I think there is going to be some variability in that U.S. piece that\u2019s in the retail channel or all the way to patient homes.\nDave Ricks: Yes. On the policy side, I mean I think you have it right there, maybe just a little subtext that -- there\u2019s sort of two pressures that prior to COVID I think we were feeling. One was a broad acceptance across both sides of the aisle that there were certain behaviors and actions which are undesirable by the industry and should be curbed. Many of these actually Lilly agrees with. So, this is about patent evergreening and strategies that involve using systems designed to create incentives in a way that perhaps is best case in foretaste and maybe worst case abusive. There\u2019s a bunch of Senate-related actions to curb these. And I think we\u2019re generally for them because we don\u2019t do those things. And I think they do create a suppression of the respect for and trust in the industry. I actually think those items will continue amidst the COVID crisis, maybe even be amplified, because as solutions come from the industry, which they will, it\u2019s clear that the producers of those solutions will be under a lot of scrutiny to make sure there\u2019s broad access and affordability and that we\u2019re acting reasonably. But I have to say, I\u2019m speaking to my peers across the industry, many collaborative projects, and within our own Company, nobody is really focused on the pure commercial side of this. It\u2019s really about solving the problem. And the spirit of collaboration and response has been tremendous. But, I think that pressure will be there, and some there could be actions coming quickly that could strike in those areas. Again, from a Lilly perspective, we\u2019re less constructive on those. In fact, we\u2019ve been for in many of those proposals. On the other hand, there\u2019s, I think from the more the far left in the U.S. and in certain OUS circles this idea that perhaps the industry itself is flawed and profit motive in pharmaceuticals is a bad thing. Of course, we vehemently disagree with that point of view. And I do think, those voices are significantly quieted today as everyone realizes that the built-up capacities of this industry are the very thing that will allow the world to escape COVID-19. And while in the absence of a pandemic, those may seem like a premium; in the presence of a pandemic, those seem really scarce and important. And so, I\u2019m more bullish on that more extreme view being significantly dissipated for some time to come. We need to behave ourselves appropriately and with good taste, if I can use that word and with kind of balance to our actions as we solve the problem. But I\u2019m encouraged by that so far. So, I think, we\u2019ve got a unique, as I said in my comments, it\u2019s just kind of a once in a generation opportunity to reset the reputation in the industry, and to put in place policies that make sense and balance profit motive, which we think clearly has a place to create new medicines, not just for COVID but others with curbing abusive behaviors and making sure we\u2019re earning a respect from patients and policymakers alike. So, anyway, we\u2019ll work on that certainly over the next couple of years. But first, we need to work on solving the pandemic problem. And that\u2019s got all my energy right now.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Geoff, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will be Louise Chen with Cantor. Go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So, my first question is, if there is any way you could give us a sense of the underlying earnings growth, if you extract the impacts from COVID and any non-operational items, even if it\u2019s just qualitatively? And then, second question is, are you expecting any economic benefit for your COVID candidates in development if they do work? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Josh?\nJosh Smiley: Hi, Louise. Thanks. I think, if you just -- at a very high level, if you just take out the revenue for Q1 that we\u2019re attributing to -- the $250 million we\u2019re attributing to buying patterns, and sort of hold everything else the same, we get down to earnings, EPS growth on a more normalized basis of about 18% or so. So, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable look at the business. As with every quarter, there are other things that we could normalize out there. But I think that\u2019s probably a good sort of starting point. And as we\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019re expecting that $250 million to normalize some sometime through the year, at least in our guidance for now. But that\u2019s where we are. I think then, on the question around economic benefits, no, there is no benefit assumed in our guidance from any of these treatments more much more interested in getting these treatments to patients at this point. And frankly, I\u2019d say, at this point, we\u2019re probably just assuming some costs for sure associated with the investment in the trials that Dan mentioned in the scale up and manufacturing and otherwise. So, some of that thinking is already embedded in our line items now.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Josh. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will be Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities. Go ahead.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thanks for all the color on the call. I just had a couple of questions on pipeline. So one, mirikizumab, you mentioned a positive initial top-line data in psoriasis. I guess, I\u2019ve been wondering about sort of differentiation for that product relative to the other IL-23. Maybe if there\u2019s anything more you can share now that you have some of the top line data? And just any update on timing, especially on the GI trials, or I think you\u2019ve talked about that being a kind of a more unique opportunity potentially. And then, going back to Alzheimer\u2019s, I appreciate your comments from before. Just regarding DIAN-TU and kind of what we saw from sola and also from gantenerumab. You mentioned the plaque reduction that you\u2019ve seen with donanemab. Does the DIAN-TU results in any way change your thoughts around sort of plaque reduction, the biomarker impact and the impact it might have on the clinical outcome at the end of the day, just because we do not see that correlation in that trial? I know, it was a small trial, but any perspective would be helpful.\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much. We announced that mirikizumab met all the co-primary and key secondary endpoints in the first OASIS-1 trial, which is the placebo-controlled 52 weeks trial in psoriasis. And that is what we expected as well. We are setting the bar extremely high in psoriasis with Taltz. We have been able now to demonstrate in five head-to-head trials superiority, and then, three of those in psoriasis, both in terms of time to onset, the level of clearance and the sustainability of a clearance. So, we are waiting now for the second Phase 3 trial, which is the head-to-head trial versus secukinumab 52-week data. And I think that will particularly inform our decision on how we progress with psoriasis indication. For miri, I think we have also stated very clearly, but the big excitement is around ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. And we really believe that in ulcerative colitis, there is big unmet need. And we have a potentially first-in-class and best-in-class asset in mirikizumab. And we also know that the biologic penetration is relatively low. And we have previously shared that we expect the top line readout for the induction data in Q4 this year and the maintenance top line in 2021. For Crohn\u2019s disease, we have announced earlier, but we will do a top line announcement in 2022. At this time and with COVID-19, we are certain that there will be a delay in one or both of those programs. However, we believe it\u2019s also premature to quantify the impact. And as the situation evolves, we will have a better understanding of the impact as well as our ability to mitigate those. And the delay here that\u2019s important to state is it\u2019s driven by difficulties to access the study sites, but particularly infusion centers, and the ability for some of those centers to conduct and perform endoscopies. So, overall, a high level of excitement still for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, and the head-to-head data versus secukinumab will guide our decision moving forward on psoriasis.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: As for Alzheimer\u2019s, DIAN-TU, I mean, of course, this is a really heroic and difficult effort to study effective drugs in the dominantly inherent Alzheimer\u2019s population. I think, unfortunately, there is just a small number of patients who completed the trial, especially with the higher dose for solanezumab. So, tough to make conclusions about any clinical effects of sola there. But, as you point out, sola is not a plaque-lowering antibody. It works on soluble A-beta. So, I can\u2019t draw conclusions about plaque-lowering from solanezumab data. I think, though, the most important things to look at in DIAN are the biomarker outcomes. And perhaps, if you think about the biomarker outcomes, you could add a little bit of confidence around plaque lowering. But once again, it\u2019s a small study and hard to draw those conclusions. I look forward to the results from our Phase 2 trial, which I think should be a clean trial, a clean test of the hypothesis in a relatively homogenous population. That data is not very far off right now.\nKevin Hern: And we\u2019re going to the next caller, please.\nOperator: That would be from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nTim Anderson: A couple of questions, please. On tirzepatide, you mentioned results in 2020, and everyone knows that, I think. Is that just likely to be top line, or are we likely to see a more set of results in some form or another, whether it\u2019s publication or presentation? And then, second question is on Tyvyt, your PD-1 in China. I feel like over time, I\u2019ve gotten mixed messages from the company on the importance of this product. Maybe a year ago, I was talking to one of the members of senior management and it was kind of described as a China-only product, of smaller importance. But, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s still the current point of view. I asked about it last quarter. I didn\u2019t get much of an answer. So, the question is really twofold on Tyvyt. The development program from here in China in terms of next tumor types; and perhaps more importantly, your plans to take this outside of China into developed markets, U.S., Europe or anywhere else that\u2019s traditionally considered developed?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ll go to Mike for the tirzepatide question and then Dave will take the Tyvyt.\nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. Just directly, we do believe we\u2019ll have our first top-line readouts of the SURPASS program for the first trial in Q4 of 2020 and then additional readouts, top-line as well as at medical meetings going into 2021. Thanks for the question.\nDave Ricks: Yes. Tim, as it relates to Tyvyt, I don\u2019t think your read of the prior commentary is wrong. I think, we originally collaborated with Innovent as a China-only play for biologics and cancer, and a few other biosimilar opportunities. But, there are -- two things have changed, which I think -- and today, we\u2019re breaking out China for the first time. So, maybe that\u2019s the third thing that\u2019s changed. But what one is that Tyvyt was the only PD-1 put on the PD-L nationally in China. So, that does change the economic profile of it for us and certainly for the Chinese business. And the second is the positive data that was released in the combination with pemetrexed in first line non-small cell lung cancer, which is very-encouraging and I think does change the trajectory of that certainly in China. Of course, right now, we\u2019re very focused on the Chinese opportunity, and that remains our focus in the short term. And as Josh mentioned, I think, in his remarks, there was a great volume growth in China for our oncology portfolio, and Tyvyt is a key part of that. So, anyway, great partnership with Innovent. They do a great job. And it\u2019s been a successful way to think about building our business, which is a little bit underrepresented in China a decade ago through local partnerships with local innovators. And we\u2019re really pleased with how that\u2019s progressed.\nKevin Hern: Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please?\nOperator: That will be Carter Gould with Barclays. Go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to I guess dig into the comment over the inevitable fiscal pressure on government-funded healthcare, specifically thinking about Europe and the pressure on budgets there. I guess, are you guys viewing it as a possibility, probability or likelihood there\u2019s incremental pricing pressure in Europe, I guess, looking out later this year or into next? I appreciate any thoughts there. And then following up on the Tyvyt discussion. When could we expect the ORION-11 data to be presented? Is that something that could still come in the first half this year, or will we have to wait until the back half of the year? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Carter. We\u2019ll go to Dave for the question for Europe, and then Anne for the question about the Tyvyt ORION-11 data.\nDave Ricks: Yes. As it relates to Europe - and I would say this extrapolates to other government-run health systems like Australia, Canada, Japan as well, we saw a policy response in nearly every jurisdiction following the \u201808, \u201809 fiscal crisis. Well, this isn\u2019t a fiscal crisis. It\u2019s -- there will be a fiscal crisis brought on by the pandemic in many of these economies. It will lower tax receipts. And then, the governments will need to look for methods to reduce their spending. I think, we can predict that with almost absolute certainty. One of the items on their list is often drugs because it\u2019s an input that can be negotiated or in many cases, they don\u2019t need to negotiate. They just change their rules. And we saw that certainly happen and create a three or four-year series of policy moves, depending on the relative strength of the economy that suppressed drug pricing in places like Europe and Australia, Canada. So, we\u2019re projecting that in the future. As Josh mentioned, we don\u2019t see a lot of that happening in \u201820, probably tax receipts falling in \u201821 lead to legislative actions in \u201821 and \u201822, which leads to suppressed pricing beyond that. That\u2019s to me a certainty across the industry. And then, the real question is how relatively innovative is your portfolio? Because a lot of these policies tend to be using leverage governments can have when there\u2019s relative substitutability. So, the more innovative the portfolio, the more immune you become to these things. Obviously, we\u2019re working hard on that side of the equation. And hopefully, we\u2019ll be on the positive end of the industry. But, I suspect as an industry as a whole, there will be -- these international pressures will present themselves across everyone\u2019s portfolios to some degree or another.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Anne?\nAnne White: Yes. Thanks for the question on Tyvyt. So, with the Phase 3 ORION study, as you know is an interim analysis that was positive, and we\u2019re very excited about initiating that submission with Innovent to the regulatory authorities in China. And we will be submitting that data for a medical meeting in the second half of this year. So, you\u2019ll see it in the second half of 2020.\nKevin Hern: Great. Thanks, Anne. Carter, thanks for your questions. We\u2019ve exhausted the queue. So we\u2019ll go to Dave to close.\nDave Ricks: All right. Thank you all. We appreciate your participation in the call and your interest in the Company. Obviously, different times today. And just on a personal note, I know many of the sell side community are based on the East Coast, and we hope you\u2019re all well and your families are functioning and certainly healthy through this crisis. As usual, any follow-up calls or questions can be directed to our really incredible Investor Relations team. And again, hope you all stay well. And we\u2019ll be in touch soon. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dr. Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. I'm proud to highlight the ongoing efforts we have to combat COVID-19. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're moving at an unprecedented pace as part of an industry-wide effort to develop a treatment for COVID-19. As a scientist and as a physician, I am incredibly impressed and thankful for the ways our teams at Lilly are working to make an impact against this new disease. We've demonstrated how nimble a large organization can be when truly focused and united behind an important cause. Slide five provides an overview of the three active therapeutic programs we are pursuing. First, is baricitinib. This is our JAK inhibitor in collaboration with Incyte. We have recently announced it is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial. Based on the known anti-inflammatory activity of baricitinib, recent data in preclinical studies and case reports from investigator sponsored clinical trials, we believe baricitinib could have potential to dampen the cytokine storm that occurs when hospitalized COVID-19 patients are fighting to combat the inflammation in their lungs, which often leads to requiring a ventilator. While we're cautiously optimistic about the potential of baricitinib to help treat patients with COVID-19, it's important to also note the approved rheumatoid arthritis indication includes warnings about the risk for developing serious infection. The baricitinib arm of the study begins this month in the U.S. with planned expansion to Europe and Asia and results are expected in the next two months. Next, we started a Phase 2 trial with a monoclonal antibody against Angiopoietin 2 or Ang2 in pneumonia patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who are at a higher risk of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome or ARDS. The Ang2 level in plasma is strongly correlated to the ARDS risk and severity, based on multiple studies in humans. Our trial we'll test with our inhibiting the effects of Ang2 with a monoclonal antibody can reduce the progression to ARDS or the need for mechanical ventilation. This trial has already begun enrolling patients at centers across the United States. We expect results from this trial in the coming months. Our third and potentially most significant program is part of our previously announced collaboration with AbCellera, where we are pursuing antibody therapies for the potential treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Our scientists have been working together with AbCellera, NIH and academic partners to characterize virus-neutralizing antibodies obtained from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from the virus. The most advanced antibody in this program shows potent neutralization of live virus, and has now entered GMP manufacturing. We plan to submit an IND to the FDA by the end of May, to allow start of clinical testing in patients. The pace at which we've advanced these potential treatments has been possible through the tireless efforts of our research and development colleagues, in partnership with a number of private and government partners. The need for treatment options to battle COVID-19 is staggering, and we are leveraging our financial resources and our very significant scientific capabilities to rapidly pursue solutions. The challenges facing our society and our economy are great, and the pharmaceutical industry is rising to the challenge. I'll now provide a brief pipeline update. Slide six shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 20th. Movement since our last earnings call includes the approval of Lyumjev in the EU and Japan, the U.S. approval of Taltz for pediatric psoriasis and previously mentioned COVID-19 trial initiations for baricitinib and Ang2, one program advancing to Phase 1, the attrition of an early phase project, and the removal of empagliflozin for type 1 diabetes, based on a complete response letter from the FDA. Moving to slide seven, we provide an update on our 2020 key events that have occurred during the quarter. In addition to previously mentioned approvals, we also announced the first of two Phase 3 trials studying mirikizumab in psoriasis met its primary endpoints, the submission of tanezumab in Europe for moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain in collaboration with Pfizer, the DIAN-TU trail for solanezumab, which did not meet its primary endpoint, and galcanezumab received a negative opinion from the CHMP for cluster headache in Europe. Before I close the R&D update, I'd like to emphasize that in addition to our ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19, we remain committed to advancing important new medicines across our entire portfolio. Although, we announced our pause to new trial starts and enrollment in most programs, we remain committed to discovering and developing new treatments for the patients we serve. With the exception of mirikizumab for GI indications, our late-stage portfolio remains on track to deliver important clinical trial data, in line with our previously communicated timelines. Of note, the tirzepatide SURPASS program in type 2 diabetes is fully enrolled, and we expect to share the first Phase 3 trial results later this year. These are challenging times around the world. But, I'm encouraged by the unprecedented response to the scientific community and the pharmaceutical industry to rapidly develop potential new treatments and vaccines for COVID-19 and to sustain advancements across all diseases. Now, I'll turn the call over to Josh to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 financial performance and our outlook going forward. Thank Andrew for the question on baricitinib and mechanism of action and potential on COVID-19. You're right in your comments about a potential for a dual mechanism of action for baricitinib. I think first publication on the potential role of baricitinib in COVID-19 came from a group called BenevolentAI where they modeled out that the effects both, on viral entry and on inflammatory response could be beneficial in this disease. The trial that we discussed that is the Adaptive COVID-19 trial with NIAID is in hospitalized patients. So, it's rather later in the disease progression. And the design of the trial is primarily to look at the effects of baricitinib on that inflammatory cascade. It's notable that that trial currently is conceived of as a factorial design with remdesivir. Of course, in addition to look at the clinical outcomes of these patients with viral load, and other factors will also be evaluated. I think, if we see success there, that could give us confidence to go earlier in the disease course. But, given sort of the mixed mechanism action here, right now, we're looking at those hospitalized patients. Yes. Thanks, Dave. So, starting out with the expectations for what if any of our molecules are successful in COVID-19. Baricitinib is probably the most straightforward to answer. It's a small molecule that can be produced at large capacity and it's already approved in geographies around the world for rheumatoid arthritis. So, depending on the quality of the data and the benefit risks that we see in COVID-19 patients, you could expect that could potentially move very, very quickly, if it's successful. Ang2 is sort of the opposite end of the spectrum. This is investigational monoclonal antibody, production is more constrained and lead times are longer, and this is a Phase 2 type trial. I think though, the one that we're most focused on, which you didn't directly ask about in your question, is the neutralizing antibodies against COVID-19. I think, that's where we see a relatively high probability of technical success, given success with neutralizing antibodies against other viruses, and also given what we've seen pre-clinically with our project. And that's also one where you can imagine a broad treatment paradigm. Antibodies like this are likely not only to work in sick patients, but could potentially have a prophylactic use, which then sort of demands large quantities. I think, in all of these programs, you just also note that these aren't chronic therapies. They're one time use or short period of time in a case of baricitinib. But still, I think for the antibody, we're working very diligently to expand our manufacturing capacity that would be ready to deploy, both internally and with partnerships, if the neutralizing antibodies are successful. We're making those investments in advance. I mentioned, we started GMP manufacturing already at our facilities to support the clinical trials and we're prepared to scale quite rapidly, if we see a positive signal with a neutralizing antibody. Your second question was on clinical trial restart timelines. I think, it's important to think about the context for why we stopped enrolling new patients and starting new clinical trials. It wasn't so much a problem with our ability to maintain the clinical trials. In fact, I'm quite confident -- even more confident today than I would have been a month ago, in our ability to meet all of our sponsor obligations, our ability to deliver drug to sites, or even directly to patients, where it's needed to measure outcomes either at the sites or by other means directly with patients. So, I'm really confident in our ability to carry out the trials. It's a desire to relieve the sites and hospitals of the burden of running clinical trials. So, we're watching our clinical trial sites carefully, many of them are already starting to ask the same question you are when they can restart. We'll make decisions along with them based on the burden of COVID-19 that they're having and how much time and attention they can devote to clinical trials. Thanks Seamus for the question on our Alzheimer's Phase 2 portfolio. You asked specifically about the donanemab, our anti N3pG-a beta antibody. This is a really robust plaque clearing antibody. We know it can clear plaques to quite a great extent and quite quickly as well. It's an 18-month Phase 2 study designed to demonstrate efficacy in a relatively large and homogenous population of Alzheimer's patients. This study is fully enrolled. It's proceeding along the previously communicated timelines, which means that last patient visit will be in the end of this year, as you said. And most likely then, we'll have a data to talk about shortly after that, although probably in January rather than December. But, no changes to our timelines on that trial. Similarly, the tau antibody as well as our symptomatic D1 PAM, those are all Phase 2 studies designed for efficacy, similarly fully enrolled and moving along the previously communicated timeline. So, no change in the Alzheimer's portfolio there. Okay. Thanks, Steve, for those questions. So, the first question was just about, like how long does the delay and your enrollment have to be before it starts to impact our long-term financials? Look, I think, you know very well that clinical trial timelines and enrollment timelines are often estimates. We give those rounded usually to the half a year or sometimes just calendar year. So, for now, you can think of these as a worst case scenario being a day-to-day delay. So, for every day that were paused enrollment, it's a stay delay to when we get the data. Now, our ambition is to beat that. And there's a couple of reasons why we think we can do that. There's sort of a latent demand to be in these clinical trials that's accumulating. So, when we put the switch again to allow enrollment, we think we'll see both, the patients and be able to make up some lost time on enrollment. That's one of the reasons. Another reason why we can even make up some time and be better than day-by-day is the fact that we can stagger our enrollment in different geographies, not everywhere in the world is similarly affected by COVID-19. So, while our comments on pausing enrollment might apply to the majority of our geographies, there could also be certain countries where we continue to enroll or even shift enrollment more to those countries. As for the clinicaltrials.gov updating, you're right that there's a time lag in that update. There's also a time lag really in stopping enrollment because you can imagine that although we say no new enrollment, there are patients who could be part of the way through screening and on a case-by-case, trial-by-trial, geography-by-geography basis. We often allow those patients who are already undergoing study procedures to continue those procedures and enrolling in a trial. So, it takes a little bit of time for all this to trickle through the system. But, I'm as I said earlier, looking forward to the day when we can turn these back on when hospitals and clinical trial sites have gotten beyond the burden of treating COVID-19 patients. Yes. Thanks Umer for the question. Surely, you're referring to sort of a small epidemiological study that looked at a risk of GIP polymorphisms. I don't think that's directly applicable to what we're seeing with tirzepatide. Here, we're studying this in a population that has diabetes. And we know from our Phase 2 trials that the physiological effects of tirzepatide, which obviously is combined GIP and GLP, are quite beneficial, and they look like they would have a strong effect on improving cardiovascular outcomes. So, we're super confident about that. In terms of the blinded event rates in ongoing studies, that's not something that we disclose or talk about. But, certainly though the rate of those events is the rate limiting factor in our submission. So, that's a long tail in our submission is waiting to get enough events to discharge any cardiovascular safety risks, so we can we can submit tirzepatide. As for Alzheimer's, DIAN-TU, I mean, of course, this is a really heroic and difficult effort to study effective drugs in the dominantly inherent Alzheimer's population. I think, unfortunately, there is just a small number of patients who completed the trial, especially with the higher dose for solanezumab. So, tough to make conclusions about any clinical effects of sola there. But, as you point out, sola is not a plaque-lowering antibody. It works on soluble A-beta. So, I can't draw conclusions about plaque-lowering from solanezumab data. I think, though, the most important things to look at in DIAN are the biomarker outcomes. And perhaps, if you think about the biomarker outcomes, you could add a little bit of confidence around plaque lowering. But once again, it's a small study and hard to draw those conclusions. I look forward to the results from our Phase 2 trial, which I think should be a clean trial, a clean test of the hypothesis in a relatively homogenous population. That data is not very far off right now."

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Well, these are challenging times for all of us as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the way we live, the way we conduct business and most importantly, the health and wellness of millions of people. Like all of you, we're hopeful that the decisions to implement social distancing will be effective to curb the spread of COVID-19 as our industry works urgently to enhance testing and speed therapies to market to treat and then prevent the virus. Today's call will have a different structure than normal. Before we discuss our Q1 results, we'll describe the impact of COVID-19 and the pandemic in general is having on our business and the actions we've taken to respond to the resulting global crisis. Our Q1 results were driven by very strong fundamentals with additional benefit from increased inventory across the supply chain, including at the patient level. This is as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that near-term benefit, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a negative impact on our business in the future. We expect headwinds later in 2020 and potentially beyond, such as destocking as supply chains normalize from the recent demand surge, decreases in new prescriptions as a result of fewer patients visiting physician's offices, potential changes in segment mix in the U.S. due to rising unemployment and pricing pressures resulting from the [Technical Difficulty] on government-funded healthcare systems around the world. While we do not yet know the extent and duration of these impacts, like everyone around the world, we're hopeful that the massive mobilization of scientific and technical resources occurring across this industry and in collaboration with government and academic labs will yield multiple effective therapies in the coming months and an effective vaccine in calendar \u201821. While it's difficult to predict the specifics of how the world manages through this pandemic, it seems clear our industry will play a leading role. In the midst of the outbreak and in its aftermath, it seems equally clear that investing in research and development to address and then conquer human disease has never been more important, and this is likely to remain true for some time. As we've navigated the crisis, we've acted with speed and agility, focusing on the needs of patients, our employees and the communities we serve and operate in. I'll provide a summary of our response, then Dan will describe our ongoing efforts to develop a treatment for COVID-19 and Josh will walk through potential financial impact of our outlook going forward. Slide four summarizes our strategic approach and actions to-date. As you can see, we focused on five areas, maintaining a safe supply of and access to our medicines; reducing the strain on the medical system; developing a treatment for the virus; keeping our employees safe; and supporting our communities. To ensure that 40-million-plus patients we serve have access to their medicines, early in the outbreak, we took a number of steps to maintain the supply of medicines around the world. To limit their exposure to the virus, we reduced personnel at our manufacturing sites to the bare minimum required to operate our facilities and enhance already robust precautionary measures for safety and cleanliness. The majority of our supply chain is multi-sourced. And from materials we supply from one source, we keep sufficient inventory on hand to avoid disruptions. Even with increased demand and customer stocking, we have sufficient inventory and production capacity for all our products. This includes all forms of insulin. And we don't currently anticipate any issues meeting patient needs through the remainder of the pandemic. Our manufacturing sites in the U.S., Europe and China have remained operational through this crisis. We're proud of the extraordinary efforts of our manufacturing colleagues, who've worked diligently to supply our medicines to patients around the world who depend on them. In addition to the numerous programs currently available through the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, we announced the introduction of the Insulin Value Program. This allows patients with commercial insurance or without insurance to limit their monthly out-of-pocket expenses for insulin to $35 per prescription. Of note, the Solution Center has seen a significant increase in daily calls since this new benefit was announced. Patient affordability continues to be a top priority, and we remain committed to helping people access to medicines they need. We've also made a number of decisions which reduced the strain on the medical system. These include pausing new clinical starts and enrollment for most ongoing programs, suspending our in-person customer visits to physicians, repurposing our labs to conduct diagnostic testing here in Indiana for COVID-19, and creating a drive-thru testing facility for healthcare workers and first responders in the Indianapolis area. We took these actions because they are the right thing to do during these challenging times and to do our part to combat the spread of COVID-19. Dan will give a more complete pipeline update later, but I would like to highlight that we do not expect significant changes to the timelines for our ongoing late-stage studies, except for the previously announced delays for the GI indications of our IL-23 antibody, mirikizumab. In terms of addressing the significant unmet need of treating COVID-19, we've acted upon several opportunities, which we hope will result in a treatment option. These include partnering with AbCellera to develop potential antibody therapies, which we expect will enter the clinic this summer, participating in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Adaptive COVID-19 treatment trial with our JAK inhibitor, baricitinib, initiating a Phase 2 clinical trial with an antibody targeting Angiopoietin 2 pointing to explore its potential use in reducing the progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19. The need for new medicines is urgent, and we've mobilized our development team at a record pace. Keeping our employees safe and healthy and our Company running smoothly is of course also a top priority. We've implemented remote work practices, added health and wellness benefits and provided additional compensation for those essential employees routinely coming to our sites, such as those in manufacturing. We've also created opportunities for employees to volunteer during work hours to support our medical system, including helping staff, drive through testing facility. To-date, Lilly has tested nearly 30,000 people for COVID-19, which represents over a third of all tests conducted in the State of Indiana, while absorbing all associated expenses. We are building on this capacity by developing serological antibody tests that will be critical in the next phase of the pandemic. In addition, we've been supporting our local communities by funding or contributing to public health awareness campaigns as well as providing assistance and deploying available resources to fight the pandemic. I would also note, our appreciation for the high-level of responsiveness and cooperation from the FDA and other government agencies in the U.S. and abroad as we partner together to fight COVID-19, and to minimize the negative impact to drug development timelines for our other innovative medicines. Across the biopharmaceutical industry, we're working around the clock, collectively driving forward to address the acute medical need created by the COVID-19 pandemic. And to further elaborate on that, I'll turn the call over now to Dan to provide more details on the ongoing efforts to treat COVID-19 and our regular pipeline update. Thanks, Josh. The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted us all in unforeseen ways. Although near-term challenges exist, we do remain confident in our long-term outlook for the Company and the strength of our fundamentals. The times of great crisis can bring out the best in people and in companies. And Lilly will continue to rise to that challenge. While a great deal of uncertainty remains, there are few certainties to which I would draw your attention. First, the collective spirit, expertise and commitment of my Lilly colleagues around the world is inspiring. Despite challenging circumstances and disrupted work routines, they've rallied to fulfill our mission of discovering and supplying medicines that make life better for people around the world. They are exceptional. Second, speed and agility continue to be critical to the success of our business. We've moved swiftly, pivoting our focus to join the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging our deep scientific capabilities and expertise on both the testing and therapeutic fronts. And lastly, I've never been more certain of the importance of a healthy and vibrant biopharmaceutical industry. While it will take time to exit the current situation, we will recover. And the pharmaceutical industry will be the primary catalyst, developing new treatments and a vaccine to combat COVID-19, allowing people across the world to return to living their lives more normally and enabling economic activity to grow. It's clear, we are a vital part of any long-term solution for fighting this or any future pandemic. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. On the policy side, I mean I think you have it right there, maybe just a little subtext that -- there's sort of two pressures that prior to COVID I think we were feeling. One was a broad acceptance across both sides of the aisle that there were certain behaviors and actions which are undesirable by the industry and should be curbed. Many of these actually Lilly agrees with. So, this is about patent evergreening and strategies that involve using systems designed to create incentives in a way that perhaps is best case in foretaste and maybe worst case abusive. There's a bunch of Senate-related actions to curb these. And I think we're generally for them because we don't do those things. And I think they do create a suppression of the respect for and trust in the industry. I actually think those items will continue amidst the COVID crisis, maybe even be amplified, because as solutions come from the industry, which they will, it's clear that the producers of those solutions will be under a lot of scrutiny to make sure there's broad access and affordability and that we're acting reasonably. But I have to say, I'm speaking to my peers across the industry, many collaborative projects, and within our own Company, nobody is really focused on the pure commercial side of this. It's really about solving the problem. And the spirit of collaboration and response has been tremendous. But, I think that pressure will be there, and some there could be actions coming quickly that could strike in those areas. Again, from a Lilly perspective, we're less constructive on those. In fact, we've been for in many of those proposals. On the other hand, there's, I think from the more the far left in the U.S. and in certain OUS circles this idea that perhaps the industry itself is flawed and profit motive in pharmaceuticals is a bad thing. Of course, we vehemently disagree with that point of view. And I do think, those voices are significantly quieted today as everyone realizes that the built-up capacities of this industry are the very thing that will allow the world to escape COVID-19. And while in the absence of a pandemic, those may seem like a premium; in the presence of a pandemic, those seem really scarce and important. And so, I'm more bullish on that more extreme view being significantly dissipated for some time to come. We need to behave ourselves appropriately and with good taste, if I can use that word and with kind of balance to our actions as we solve the problem. But I'm encouraged by that so far. So, I think, we've got a unique, as I said in my comments, it's just kind of a once in a generation opportunity to reset the reputation in the industry, and to put in place policies that make sense and balance profit motive, which we think clearly has a place to create new medicines, not just for COVID but others with curbing abusive behaviors and making sure we're earning a respect from patients and policymakers alike. So, anyway, we'll work on that certainly over the next couple of years. But first, we need to work on solving the pandemic problem. And that's got all my energy right now. Yes. Tim, as it relates to Tyvyt, I don't think your read of the prior commentary is wrong. I think, we originally collaborated with Innovent as a China-only play for biologics and cancer, and a few other biosimilar opportunities. But, there are -- two things have changed, which I think -- and today, we're breaking out China for the first time. So, maybe that's the third thing that's changed. But what one is that Tyvyt was the only PD-1 put on the PD-L nationally in China. So, that does change the economic profile of it for us and certainly for the Chinese business. And the second is the positive data that was released in the combination with pemetrexed in first line non-small cell lung cancer, which is very-encouraging and I think does change the trajectory of that certainly in China. Of course, right now, we're very focused on the Chinese opportunity, and that remains our focus in the short term. And as Josh mentioned, I think, in his remarks, there was a great volume growth in China for our oncology portfolio, and Tyvyt is a key part of that. So, anyway, great partnership with Innovent. They do a great job. And it's been a successful way to think about building our business, which is a little bit underrepresented in China a decade ago through local partnerships with local innovators. And we're really pleased with how that's progressed. Yes. As it relates to Europe - and I would say this extrapolates to other government-run health systems like Australia, Canada, Japan as well, we saw a policy response in nearly every jurisdiction following the \u201808, \u201809 fiscal crisis. Well, this isn't a fiscal crisis. It's -- there will be a fiscal crisis brought on by the pandemic in many of these economies. It will lower tax receipts. And then, the governments will need to look for methods to reduce their spending. I think, we can predict that with almost absolute certainty. One of the items on their list is often drugs because it's an input that can be negotiated or in many cases, they don't need to negotiate. They just change their rules. And we saw that certainly happen and create a three or four-year series of policy moves, depending on the relative strength of the economy that suppressed drug pricing in places like Europe and Australia, Canada. So, we're projecting that in the future. As Josh mentioned, we don't see a lot of that happening in \u201820, probably tax receipts falling in \u201821 lead to legislative actions in \u201821 and \u201822, which leads to suppressed pricing beyond that. That's to me a certainty across the industry. And then, the real question is how relatively innovative is your portfolio? Because a lot of these policies tend to be using leverage governments can have when there's relative substitutability. So, the more innovative the portfolio, the more immune you become to these things. Obviously, we're working hard on that side of the equation. And hopefully, we'll be on the positive end of the industry. But, I suspect as an industry as a whole, there will be -- these international pressures will present themselves across everyone's portfolios to some degree or another. All right. Thank you all. We appreciate your participation in the call and your interest in the Company. Obviously, different times today. And just on a personal note, I know many of the sell side community are based on the East Coast, and we hope you're all well and your families are functioning and certainly healthy through this crisis. As usual, any follow-up calls or questions can be directed to our really incredible Investor Relations team. And again, hope you all stay well. And we'll be in touch soon. Take care."

            "content": "Yes. Terence, thanks for the question on selpercatinib. So, I'm pleased to share that there's been no delay in the regulatory timeline for selpercatinib. And the FDA has been extremely collaborative and responsive in working through these challenges, time. So, we just thank them for the speed and the commitment they've had. They continue to progress the application. And as you know, we submitted in December, it's currently under priority review. So, we expect to have regulatory action by the PDUFA date in Q3. Regarding your questions on launch, it is interesting times, obviously. And as a Company, as Dave shared, we continue to prioritize combating the spread of coronavirus, and we recognize that this is also the case for healthcare professionals, and we're incredibly aware of the load that they're carrying at this time and need to express our appreciation for all of their efforts on behalf of their patients. So, with that, we also though recognize that selpercatinib has shown striking efficacy and really a very favorable safety profile in treating lung and thyroid cancers with RET fusions or RET mutations. And so, we think it's still very important that patients and physicians are aware that there's a new medicine available, and the first to specifically target RET alterations. So, what we're doing with launch activity is they will look different. But we're committed to making sure that patients who are good candidates for selpercatinib have access. So, assuming that in-person interactions are still on hold when we launch, we're going to focus initially on making sure that we inform customers of the approval and the key efficacy and safety data via email and other digital channels that we have. We're also going to make sure that we're quick to engage in virtual product details when the customer requests those and give them more information. And then, when appropriate, we're also going to make sure that we leverage virtual peer to peer programs to provide thought leaders the opportunity to share the data with their colleagues. And in addition, of course, we'll be sharing the data through a top tier journal publication, as well as in upcoming medical meetings. So, we'll make sure that the -- the goal here is to make sure that physicians and patients are aware and informed that we have now an incredible new medicine that's specifically targeted for RET. And it's just been an incredible partnership with Loxo and Lilly teams. If you think about it, this medicine started Phase 1, first patient dosed in May of 2017, and we're looking at approval here in 2020. So, it's remarkable. And our thanks really goes to the FDA for the speed at which they're moving through the review. Yes. Thanks for the question on Tyvyt. So, with the Phase 3 ORION study, as you know is an interim analysis that was positive, and we're very excited about initiating that submission with Innovent to the regulatory authorities in China. And we will be submitting that data for a medical meeting in the second half of this year. So, you'll see it in the second half of 2020."

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "Thank you very much. We announced that mirikizumab met all the co-primary and key secondary endpoints in the first OASIS-1 trial, which is the placebo-controlled 52 weeks trial in psoriasis. And that is what we expected as well. We are setting the bar extremely high in psoriasis with Taltz. We have been able now to demonstrate in five head-to-head trials superiority, and then, three of those in psoriasis, both in terms of time to onset, the level of clearance and the sustainability of a clearance. So, we are waiting now for the second Phase 3 trial, which is the head-to-head trial versus secukinumab 52-week data. And I think that will particularly inform our decision on how we progress with psoriasis indication. For miri, I think we have also stated very clearly, but the big excitement is around ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. And we really believe that in ulcerative colitis, there is big unmet need. And we have a potentially first-in-class and best-in-class asset in mirikizumab. And we also know that the biologic penetration is relatively low. And we have previously shared that we expect the top line readout for the induction data in Q4 this year and the maintenance top line in 2021. For Crohn's disease, we have announced earlier, but we will do a top line announcement in 2022. At this time and with COVID-19, we are certain that there will be a delay in one or both of those programs. However, we believe it's also premature to quantify the impact. And as the situation evolves, we will have a better understanding of the impact as well as our ability to mitigate those. And the delay here that's important to state is it's driven by difficulties to access the study sites, but particularly infusion centers, and the ability for some of those centers to conduct and perform endoscopies. So, overall, a high level of excitement still for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and the head-to-head data versus secukinumab will guide our decision moving forward on psoriasis."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Josh Smiley",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. As Dave shared earlier, we are confident that our business fundamentals are strong and that we're well positioned to navigate the obstacles ahead. However, there undoubtedly will be a near term impact to our industry and our company. So, the length and magnitude of the effects are uncertain. So, I'll spend a few minutes discussing the financial impact of COVID-19 on our Q1 performance, and providing a framework for how we are thinking about this potential impact going forward, before then providing a more detailed review of our financial results. We began 2020, with positive momentum and observed robust prescription trends in January and February. As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world and economic activity slows significantly in many cities and regions, we observed the following changes and behaviors that affected our business. Patients refilled existing prescriptions earlier than normal or bought a larger supply to ensure that they didn't run out. Wholesalers and retailers increased the level of inventory on hand to ensure adequate supply. Reduced hospital visits resulted in a preference for medicines that do not require administration in a physician's office or the hospital. Patients abandoned fewer prescriptions at the pharmacy counter. Mail order utilization increased, which typically has a larger number of units per prescription in those filled at retail pharmacies, and new therapy starts slowed as patients largely avoided hospitals and clinics unless they were seeking treatment for COVID-19. We estimate, the net impact of these trends resulted in increased patient and channel stocking, which increased worldwide sales by roughly $250 million in Q1 with approximately $200 million of that impact in the U.S. We think the majority of the U.S. impact occurred in our diabetes portfolio and notable products, where we believe increased stocking impacted our Q1 U.S. results include, insulins by approximately $70 million to $80 million, Trulicity by approximately $30 million to $40 million, and Taltz by approximately $20 million to $25 million. While we expect much of this stocking to reverse in future quarters as the excess supply in the channel and in patients' medicine cabinets is consumed, the timing and ultimate levels are uncertain. We continue to closely monitor these factors and will utilize our quarterly earnings calls to provide update to our outlook. Slide eight lists a number of factors we are monitoring that may impact our financial performance. While reduced new therapy starts had a negligible impact during Q1, this impact could grow in future periods as fewer new starts translate into fewer total prescriptions. In the U.S., we are starting to see an impact as IQVIA reported new-to-brand prescriptions across the industry declined by 42% for the week ending April 10th versus pre-COVID-19 averages. For our portfolio, we anticipate this impact to be more pronounced to our immunology and pain products and less so for oncology and diabetes. However, we expect this impact to be temporary as patients will return to seeing their doctors as social distancing restrictions are lifted. Over the midterm, the significant increase in unemployment we are seeing could be a headwind. Increased unemployment may result in a shift of patients from commercial insurance to lower net price government insurance in the U.S. or to being uninsured. We're monitoring this dynamic closely. And while it could create headwinds in the near-term, this effect should lessen when the global economy eventually strengthens. Given the significant benefits our products provide to 40 million patients around the world, we remain competent in our long-term outlook for revenue growth and margin expansion. In terms of managing capital, our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and we have investment grade ratings from both Moody's and S&P. We're confident in our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and have not seen an impact to our ability to access capital markets, including commercial paper at reasonable rates. Financial strength is a valuable asset during this period and we intend to maintain our current credit ratings, while using our balance sheet capacity to invest in the business and pursue business development opportunities and enhance our future growth prospects. I'll provide more details on our 2020 outlook shortly, but in summary, we do expect the impacts on our financial results through the remainder of the year and potentially into 2021, but the underlying strength and momentum in our business is strong. While combating the COVID-19 pandemic is a top priority, we remain focused on executing our strategy of developing new medicines for patients. We exited 2019 with very strong momentum in revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by the uptake of our newer products. On slide nine, you'll see that momentum continued in Q1 2020 as we delivered strong underlying business performance augmented by the estimated COVID-19-related buying patterns from patients and customers I just described. Revenue growth accelerated in Q1, increasing 15% versus Q1 2019 or 16% in constant currency. This strong performance was driven by volume, which contributed 22 percentage points of growth. Net of the estimated COVID-19 impact, revenue growth was 11% for the quarter in constant currency. Our newer medicines continue to be the driver of this growth, representing more than half of our revenue in the quarter. We've made good progress in Q1 on our productivity agenda as operating income grew 32% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin improved by 390 basis points to 30.1% as revenue growth outpaced operating expenses. The estimated impact of COVID-19 buying patterns on the quarter also had a positive impact on our non-GAAP operating margin. But, as we discussed during our 2020 financial guidance call, we expect our 2020 operating margin to build throughout the year to achieve our 2020 target for the full year of 31%. We've announced multiple pipeline milestones since our Q4 2019 earnings call, including approval of Lyumjev in Europe and Japan, and new indications for both Trulicity and Taltz in the U.S. During Q1, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via share repurchases and the dividend. As previously announced, we increased the dividend by 15% for 2020. At this point, we do not expect to make additional share repurchases in the near term, in order to maintain a cushion of liquidity and capacity for investment and continued dividend growth. Finally, we closed the acquisition of Dermira, a company focused on developing new therapies for chronic skin conditions, enhancing our Phase 3 pipeline with the addition of lebrikizumab, which is complementary to our dermatology business. Slide 10 includes the summary of key events since our last earnings call. Moving to slide 11, our non-GAAP financial performance in Q1 was robots, even when adjusting for the COVID-19 impact described earlier. In addition to strong top-line performance, gross margin as a percent of revenue was stable versus Q1 2019 at approximately 80% as favorable product mix and greater manufacturing efficiencies were partially offset by price and increased costs associated with COVID-19. Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew slower than revenue at 7% versus last year's quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased modestly by 2%, as cost containment and productivity measures offset investments in key growth products. Travel restrictions and the suspension of in-person customer interactions late in the quarter, did result in lower travel and meeting expenses. However, it is offset by a higher U.S. branded prescription drug manufacturing fee that we recognized in Q1. R&D expenses grew 13%, reflecting higher development expenses for late-stage assets that increased throughout 2019. Our pause on clinical trial starts had limited impact in Q1. Operating income increased 32% compared to Q1 2019 as sales growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in operating income as a percent of revenue of 30.1% for the quarter. We begin 2020 with good momentum executing our strategy and are on track to achieve our 2020 full-year operating margin target of 31%. Other income and expenses was income of $89 million this quarter compared to income of $86 million in Q1 2019. In both quarters, this was driven by investment gains on public equities. Mark-to-market gains in Q1 2020, were primarily generated by prior equity investments in companies that are now pursuing vaccines for COVID-19. As we regularly highlight, this line item can be volatile as public market valuations fluctuate. Our tax rate was 13.6%, an increase of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year, driven primarily by the mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in net discreet tax benefits. So, at the bottom line, earnings per share increased 32%. On slide 12, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. As mentioned earlier, worldwide revenue grew 16% in constant currency during Q1, driven by strong volume growth of 22%, which we estimate at 17% net of the impact of COVID-19 buying patterns. This was partially offset by price. Foreign exchange had a modest negative impact on revenue growth this quarter. Price declined 3% net of the price impact from the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government-sponsored programs in China. U.S. revenue grew 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2019. Volume growth of 19% was led by Trulicity, Humalog, Taltz, Alimta, Verzenio, Emgality, and Basaglar. As I mentioned earlier, we saw stocking at the wholesale and patient level due to COVID-19 that contributed approximately $200 million of revenues this quarter. While the situation remains fluid, we do expect this impact to largely reverse over the course of 2020. Pricing was a 4% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, in line with our 2020 guidance. This was driven primarily by growth in lower price segment, primarily driven by our diabetes products, which was partially offset by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts recalls and reduced utilization of patient assistance programs for Emgality due to increased commercial reimbursement. We have strong commercial and Medicare Part D access across the portfolio and have remained intact throughout Q1. Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 21% in constant currency, driven by 24% volume growth, partially offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and price. Volume growth was led by Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio and also benefited from the divestiture of a legacy product in Spain. We estimate total international results were impacted by approximately $50 million of stocking due to the impact of COVID-19 in Q1 and the significant majority of this occurred in Europe. However, the underlying trends are very strong, as our newer products have continued to scale. In Japan, revenue grew 8% in constant currency, driven by volume growth, somewhat offset by a modest pricing headwind due to government mandated price decreases that went into effect in 2019. Verzenio, Cyramza, Trulicity, Olumiant and Alimta were the key contributors to growth, partially offset by increased competition from Forteo and the impact of generic Strattera. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency, driven by 93% volume growth, partially offset by pricing concessions associated with the inclusion of Tyvyt and Alimta in government sponsored programs. We're very pleased with the significant volume increases we saw for these products and our ability to increase access for patients disease to these important cancer medicines. Outside of Tyvyt and Alimta, our business in China saw a meaningful decline in new patients starts during Q1 as the COVID-19 spread peaked during March. As the situation appears to be moving toward more stability, we are cautiously encouraged that new patient initiation and in-person customer interactions have begun to resume. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 14% in constant currency, driven by increased volume from our key growth drivers, Trulicity, Jardiance in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, Taltz, Cialis and Cyramza drove growth in Q1. As shown on slide 13, our key growth products continue to drive impressive worldwide volume growth. These new medicines delivered nearly 20 percentage points of growth this quarter, while also benefiting from the increased stocking that I described earlier. Slide 14 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated nearly $3 billion in revenue this quarter, making up 51% of total revenue. On slide 15, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2020, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditures and after tax investment in R&D. In addition, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. We remain well-capitalized and closed Q1 with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments, and the ability to access debt markets at attractive rates. Moving to slide 16, you'll find our updated 2020 financial guidance. This is based on our best estimate at this time as we're balancing transparency and insight into the current view of our business with the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Key assumptions supporting our updated guidance include the Q1 stocking benefit largely reverses over the course of 2020; the near-term reduction in new patient prescriptions, peaks in the second quarter in the U.S. and much of Europe; healthcare activity returns to more normal levels in the second half of this year, as doctors resume seeing new patients; price headwinds from the increased utilization of patient affordability programs and changes in segment mix due to increased us unemployment; and enrollment in existing studies, as well as the initiation of new clinical trials resumes midyear; and near-term spending on travel, in-person customer interactions and direct consumer advertising decreases and investments in digital promotion and support increases. We do believe the reduction in new patient starts will be temporary, but will impact our 2020 performance. The potential impact from increased unemployment will likely be more muted in the near term, but the impact could be more pronounced in 2021, depending on the shape of an economic recovery and the U.S. government programs to stimulate employment. While the extended duration of impact from COVID-19 drives the most uncertainty in our outlook, the positive underlying momentum in Q1 in our business augmented by the addition -- the estimated additional revenue benefit from COVID-19 related buying patterns, gives us confidence that the potential downside for the remainder of the year is accommodated within our previously community revenue range. While there are scenarios that could cause revenue to fall outside either end of our range, we believe the revenue range accommodates most of the uncertainty we see today. In addition to the impact of unemployment and the pace of economic recovery described earlier, the main variables we will monitor are the impact on new prescription trends during social distancing period, and the timing of resumption of non-COVID-19 healthcare activities. While we currently anticipate the most pronounced impact on new prescriptions to occur in Q2, the headwinds are likely to show up in Q3 and Q4 as inventory levels normalize, and the impact of pure new prescriptions compound. Moving down the income statement, we're confirming our prior expectations for gross margin as a percent of revenue to be roughly 81% on a non-GAAP basis and 79% on a GAAP basis. We do anticipate higher manufacturing costs associated with the extraordinary measures we are taking to keep our manufacturing workers safe and to keep medicines flowing to patients around the world. We expect this to be offset though by benefits from higher manufacturing volumes. We're maintaining a range for marketing, selling and administrative expenses as savings from reduced travel and decreased promotion are anticipated to be offset by investments in digital capabilities and increased marketing expenses in the second half of the year for key growth products. Our range for research and development expenses is also unchanged as savings from the pause to clinical trial activity are offset by our investments to pursue therapeutic treatments for COVID-19, as Dan described earlier. Therefore, there's no change to our non-GAAP operating income as a percent of revenue guidance of 31%. We're updating the range of other income and expense to 0 to $150 million of expense, reflecting Q1 gains in our equity portfolio. Obviously, this number has some volatility going forward and we'll update accordingly. Turning to taxes. There's no change to our GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance of approximately 15%. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.90 on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.20 to $6.40. We are increasing the range to reflect the uncertainty of the impact to our business for the remainder of the year. Our performance in the first quarter, net of COVID-19 benefit, highlights the strength of our underlying business fundamentals. And as Dave mentioned in his introduction, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our business. So Dave, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks. Hi, Terrence. Thanks. On capital allocation, we really are sticking to our strategy. And as we've outlined, we do see external innovation or business development as a key component of our long-term growth strategy. But, what we're really focused on -- continue to focus on are key opportunities in our therapeutic areas where we can bring in first or best-in-class type of assets into the pipeline. We're continuing -- I think that work continues. I haven't seen anything slow down as a function of not being able to travel or work from home types of activities. Certainly, there are a smaller biotech companies that may have different views in terms of their cash runway or ease. And to the extent that that helps to engender more discussions, we'll take advantage of that. I don't think it changes anything in terms of how we think about size, our business is strong, as I mentioned, and we don't see benefits in large scale types of acquisition. So, we'll continue to focus on the things that we are focused on. And I think for as long as we're in these kinds of social distancing restrictions, I don't see that as impacting our ability to transact. Thanks, Chris. On your question on what could happen to net price going forward given what we're seeing in the in the U.S. with the economy, first, I think it's too early to make too many predictions. There's a lot to still see. And as you highlighted in your question, we've already assumed that we're going to see negative net prices in the U.S. for -- between now and 2025. That's already in our current guidance. So, I would see whatever happens here is probably a moderate impact on that. I think, what we have to keep in mind first for Lily's portfolio, we're spread across multiple payer segments. Certainly, in general, a move from a well-insured commercial patient to Medicaid is a net negative. But, many of the commercial patients, it's my assumption, who are losing -- in the first wave, losing employment, they may not be in great commercial plans to begin with their exchanges and other things. So, there's a lot to still see what happens here. Our view is, we'll ensure that the patients who are losing insurance have access to our medications and programs. We, as Dave mentioned, announced the $35 change to our diabetes program. So, we're looking at everything we can do to ensure that people can stay on our medications and have access to them, and believe that some of these impacts will be temporary and then we'll have a much better sense by the end of the year on what 2021 looks like. But, I'd say, overall, our expectation is this continues the trend, the net price declines, but not a fundamental change to our thinking about the business. Thank you, Andrew. I think, as it relates to 2020, our sales guidance range on the -- I described sort of the factors we're looking at. I'd say, if we're on the lower end of that sales range, we do include in our thinking there some incremental impact from pricing. Again, I think it'd probably be pretty muted this year. And then, I think we'll just have to look and see what next year looks like. And I think it's not just absolute levels of unemployment, it's what programs are in place to bridge the gap and otherwise. So, this year, again, I think our range, given the strong position we're starting from Q1, our range accommodates potential incremental pricing impacts for potentially short-term moves to insurance or Medicaid. But I think at this point, it's a little early to have -- rollout specifics around this one. Sure. Thanks, Seamus. In terms of -- across our entire portfolio, in the U.S., about 10% of our volume is Medicaid right now, about 40% is commercial insurance, 20% Part D, and then the rest is Part B or hospital-based or uninsured or other types of volumes. As we talked about before, I think the biggest sort of challenge would be a really well insured commercial patient moving to Medicaid. There are a lot of steps in between those things happening. As I mentioned, in the prior question, we are anticipating in our sale guidance for 2020 that we could see some net impact as a function of that. But again, I would say, it's -- and we've looked at all those estimates and in terms of what the long-term look could be. And we'll provide more updates on that for 2021 when we have a better sense. But again, I'd say that our sales guidance right now does accommodate the fact that we may see some near-term moves to increase Medicaid or increase uninsured. Thanks, Navin. First, our outlook at the beginning of the year for U.S. price was net declines in the low single digits. And, as I mentioned, in the range that we're looking at now, I think we're still in the low single digits that that could add in the more pessimistic case, maybe that adds a point or something but it's still in the same range. To your question specifically about products, what we said is insulins are not profitable in Medicaid. We pay in effect 100% rebates for patients who are on our mealtime insulins in Medicaid. So, that's a place where you see a real challenge I think if -- to the extent that the patients are moving from commercial insurance to Medicaid. On Trulicity, it's less of an issue. It's still net positive but Medicaid just in general is a lower price segment than commercial plan. But it wouldn't be as big of a move as it would be for our commercially insured mealtime insulin patients. On Trulicity, I think, we've highlighted through the last few years that Trulicity access is not as strong as it is for the rest of our portfolio. And what we do in many cases is Trulicity patients have to step through various PAs or restrictions in their plan. We make estimates on our utilization on how things are going to transpire there. What we found in Q1 is we were actually getting more net price for a segment of our patients than we had estimated. So, we've got a little bit of a benefit there. I think, for the year, we're still sort of assuming the same that we maintain a kind of access that we have now at relatively constant prices. And you'll see these ups and downs and it's a little bit challenging in Taltz for the reason that I mentioned. You'll see sort of the quarterly ups and downs. But, the underlying trend that we see is pretty stable pricing, pretty stable access. Hi, Umer. Thanks for the question. And I think you are building on one of the comments I made, which was, I don't think you can just look at sort of a move from commercial to Medicaid. It's very much driven by plan dynamics and otherwise. And I think without getting into too much detail, yes, it is fair to say that patients in high deductible plans, when they're in that deductible phase, you know that we and other pharmaceutical companies have copay cards and other things to try to alleviate sort of the cash burden at the retail pharmacy. So, we do -- the net price for those specific prescriptions to us is very low and probably in many cases could be lower than a Medicaid prescription. But again, I think that gets back to what I was saying earlier, I think it's way too premature to make assumptions around what a move from commercial to Medicaid may look like. There are lots of complexities here and I think lots of things still to be learned about the economy and what 2021 will look like. But, it's not -- we're not as I think on a mass basis as concerned as probably it looks like when you just look at just general commercial to a Medicaid for one of the reasons that you are sort of implying in your question. So, just on the $250 million, we estimated in Q1, as we mentioned, about $200 million are added in the U.S., and we talked about the three big product categories. I think, the rest -- the product I didn't mention is sort of spread nominally among those others. As we look at that $200 million in the U.S., only -- less than a third of that is at the wholesale -- wholesaler level. So, we saw some modest build at the wholesaler. Most of that estimate we're making is either in the retail channel or all the way down to patients -- in patients' homes. So, I think it's going to be pretty difficult. I mean, we're assuming that that will turn around. But, I think being able to sort of make a prediction at this point is top, I would assume the wholesaler piece will start to normalize more quickly and I think we're seeing that. The retail and patient piece I think will be -- some of it will be a function of what happens in social distancing otherwise, and some of it, who knows, it may be a little bit more -- have a long tail associated with that. What we saw in Europe, there was about $50 million. And I think most of the estimate is around our diabetes portfolio. And I think that one we probably assume is a little more likely to normalize in the second half of this year. So, I think Geoff, we'll try to be transparent about this as we move through the quarter. But, I think there is going to be some variability in that U.S. piece that's in the retail channel or all the way to patient homes. Hi, Louise. Thanks. I think, if you just -- at a very high level, if you just take out the revenue for Q1 that we're attributing to -- the $250 million we're attributing to buying patterns, and sort of hold everything else the same, we get down to earnings, EPS growth on a more normalized basis of about 18% or so. So, I think that's probably a reasonable look at the business. As with every quarter, there are other things that we could normalize out there. But I think that's probably a good sort of starting point. And as we've mentioned we're expecting that $250 million to normalize some sometime through the year, at least in our guidance for now. But that's where we are. I think then, on the question around economic benefits, no, there is no benefit assumed in our guidance from any of these treatments more much more interested in getting these treatments to patients at this point. And frankly, I'd say, at this point, we're probably just assuming some costs for sure associated with the investment in the trials that Dan mentioned in the scale up and manufacturing and otherwise. So, some of that thinking is already embedded in our line items now."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.\nKevin Hern: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Q4 2021 Earnings Call. I\u2019m Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly\u2019s Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We are also joined by Lauren Zierke, KentoUeha and Sara Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. 2021 was another outstanding year for Lilly as we delivered strong top and bottom-line growth and positive pivotal readouts for five important assets with the potential to launch in the next two years. As we move into 2022, we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth, expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs. Unpacking our 2021 performance on Slide 4, you can see the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables. Q4 revenue was 8% and was driven by volume growth of 11%. While when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year. This volume-driven performance is attributable to our key growth products, which grew by 28% and now account for 61% of our core business in Q4. On our non-GAAP, gross margin was 76.1% in Q4, a decrease of approximately 250 basis points, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 antibodies, which have a lower gross margin profile. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%, representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned. For pipeline milestones, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call, including additional positive Phase III readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. The initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for pertibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelizumab to the FDA for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both North Carolina and Ireland. These investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long-term growth. In addition, this quarter, we announced a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities. Finally, on financials, we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And in Q4, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another $750 million in share repurchases. Moving to Slides 5 and 6, you will see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and COVID-19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our December 15 Investment Community Meeting. So now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full-year 2021 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q4, revenue grew 8% and revenue, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, increased 6%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Full-year revenue growth was 10% on that latter basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76.1% in Q4. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies, with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, also having lower gross margin profile compared to bevalinuzumab sales in the base period. Total operating expenses grew 5% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D expenses increased 7%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage pipeline opportunities, including donanemab, pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide, which were partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. We invested approximately $40 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q4, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $400 million for the full-year. Operating income increased 3% compared to Q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31.7% for the quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent, partially offset by lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Full-year operating margin was 29.9%, in line with our expectations. Other income and expense was an expense of approximately $7 million this quarter compared to an expense of $31 million in Q4 2020. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 10.3%, a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits. At the bottom line, we delivered solid growth as earnings per share - 8% in Q4 and 20% for the full-year. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This growth driven by volume was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. The net price decline of 2% in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. For the full-year, our U.S. net price decrease of 1% was in line with our expectations. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 declined 3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, revenue grew 11% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe, and expect continued growth excluding Alimta. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 14% in constant currency. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including Cymbalta and Alimta as well as by the COVID pandemic. With key growth products now representing 56% of total Japan revenue, we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 13% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity as well as the timing of supply for Cialis through the third-party selling the product. Q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 NRDL price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for Tyvyt. In 2022, we expect the NRDL price reduction headwind largely offset volume growth in Q1, but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions. Moving forward, we are excited about the significant growth we are seeing in China, over 40% in constant currency in 2021, with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan. In China, the expanded NRDL access for our products should lead to significant volume increase, but also high double-digit decline in price. As a result, we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021, which shows strong double-digit volume-driven revenue growth across most major geographies. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated over $4.2 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue. In Q4, these newer medicines grew by 28% and Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and the SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders. We are also encouraged by the strong uptake of Verzenio we saw in Q4, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2021, we invested 9.3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately 3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.3 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches, invest in our pipeline, evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in December. As I shared then, the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in Europe and Japan will continue in the first half of 2022. While the impact from Alimta\u2019s U.S. patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in Q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in Q2. We expect roughly 375 million of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in Q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last November\u2019s U.S. Government Purchase Agreement. We continue to invest in our bright future, advance in promising R&D opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thank you, Anat. 2021 was a remarkable year for Lilly\u2019s pipeline. We delivered positive data on 5 molecules: tirzepatide, tenenumab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, all of which have the potential to launch in the next two years, and we are excited about the potential of these molecules hold for patients. In addition, we launched and submitted several key new indications for in-market products, including important new indications for Verzenio and Jardiance. And also, we advanced our early-stage pipeline. Just a few weeks-ago, we provided an extensive R&D update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from Lilly. As a result, today\u2019s R&D update will be brief and focus on the progress we have made since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 31, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022. In Diabetes, with the recent submission in Japan, we have now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year. We anticipate U.S. regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from SURMOUNT-1, both by midyear. In Japan, we submitted Jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for Jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Moving to Oncology. We shared encouraging updated data at ASH for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. We continue to progress this molecule and initiated another Phase III study in first-line CLL comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy. During our December meeting, we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for MCL in the U.S. We plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023, and we are excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated timeline. For Verzenio, we received approval for high-risk early breast cancer in Japan for the Cohort 1 population study to monarchE and are pleased that this approval represents 90% of the intent-to-treat population. We have also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the Phase III study of Verzenio for HER2 positive early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges. Importantly, this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer. In addition, we began a Phase III study for selpetatinib for the treatment of adjuvant RET-positive non-small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the U.S. trial of our BCL-2 inhibitor. In Immunology, we announced positive top line data for our Phase III maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. We are pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year. We also announced positive top line Phase III results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, and we are encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis. We await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions, which are expected by the end of 2022. Moving to baricitinib. We announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from two Phase III trials, we have decided to discontinue the Phase III development program for lupus. For atopic dermatitis in the U.S., we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA, but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population, which could possibly lead to a complete response letter. We expect regulatory action for this indication very soon. Finally, we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the U.S. and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year. In our early phase immunology portfolio, we started a new Phase I study for CD19 antibody and we have discontinued our oral IL-17 inhibitor. Moving to neurodegeneration. In our early-phase pipeline, we announced that we have received breakthrough therapy designation for N3pG4, an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year. We have evidence that this therapy is completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque and we are exploring flexible dosing regimens, including subcutaneous dosing. For the treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, we also began a Phase II trial for our oglic/nacase inhibitor, an oral small molecule targeting tau. While donanemab has been a primary focus for investors, we are pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline. Now turning to donanemab, in December, we initiated two additional Phase III studies, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, our prevention study for asymptomatic Alzheimer\u2019s disease; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head plaque clearance study compared to add-a-helm. It has been less than one year since we published a positive randomized controlled TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function. Since then, we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well-designed expanded Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid-2023. While a lot has happened in this space during this last year, and more events are likely before we get top line results next year, what hasn\u2019t changed for us is the importance of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design. Given the impact of this devastating disease, we believe that if TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 provides positive confirmatory data, we can\u2019t see a scenario where there is not global reimbursement, patient access and broad use of donanemab. We noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory Phase III data in mid-2023. We are disappointed with the position that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision, and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout if reconsideration of CMS coverage determination is required, given historical timelines for this process. While the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the FDA to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials, the NCD is currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Still, we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year, but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of Q1. We expect further volatility and expectations as competitor Alzheimer\u2019s disease trials read out prior to our definitive data. We remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. And importantly, the long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Lastly, with respect to our progress with COVID-19 therapies. Earlier this year, we submitted a request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelimumab for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 and for patients at high risk for progression of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This is the third antibody we have developed for the treatment of COVID-19, and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern. We have produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives EUA from the FDA. In addition, we have also submitted a supplemental NDA for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year. Baricitinib currently has an EUA for this indication. We are proud of the therapies we have delivered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to do our part as public health needs emerge. In summary, Q4 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly, capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients. Now I will turn the call back to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2021. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive Phase III data for five new potential medicines: tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next two years. We also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for Jardiance and Verzenio, while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities. Finally, we returned $4.35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fourth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase. As we move into 2022, we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow, starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. These opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s, cancers and autoimmune disorders. We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients who rely on us and are confident in our business outlook. So now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. [Operator Instructions] Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we are ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: So first, Dan, can you just give us a little bit of the thought process for pushing out the accelerated filing for donanemab, it certainly makes sense. But how much did the NCD actually work into that calculus versus needs or requests from the agency for additional data? And then the second question, just really wanted to get a better understanding of where you guys think this SURMOUNT-1 data sets, where the thresholds would be. We are seeing 68-week data from Wegovy coming in at about 15% to 17% in a non-diabetic patient population. Just wanted to get a sense of some of the pushes and pulls that we should be thinking about in the context of the SURMOUNT-1 data set. Thanks so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We will go to Dan for the question on accelerated approval timeline and then Mike Mason on expectations for SURMOUNT-1.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thank you, Seamus. It is a good question. Look, I think, as I said, the purpose of accelerated approvals to try and get medicines and to help patients faster. Without access, that benefit is mainly negated, unfortunately, and clearly, a very frustrating period for patients to have approval of a drug and no reimbursement. So the CMS draft NCD proposal weighed heavily in our considerations around timing and clearly reduces some of the ability to help patients faster than we were hoping for the accelerated approval. With respect to the other part of your question, which is how about requests from the FDA or new data or anything like that, there are none of those factors here. We haven\u2019t had such requests. So it is really about CMS and about our own team\u2019s ability to just get all of the data together and get the right amount of safety data compiled in a way that the FDA can analyze. So we will continue to work towards accelerated approval yet this year, but no longer in Q1.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are excited to see this SURMOUNT-1 data. There is good theory on why someone who live with obesity would have greater weight loss on a product like tirzepatide than those that have type 2 diabetes. Those theories tend to play out when we looked at the novo semaglutides step program where those who didn\u2019t have type 2 diabetes had six or seven percentage points greater weight loss than those that had type 2 diabetes. We don\u2019t know what it is going to turn out to be for SURMOUNT-1. We do believe that it is going to be higher in the non-type 2 diabetes patient than what we saw in the SURPASS studies. Good thing is we don\u2019t have to wait too long for those results. We expect those in the first half of this year. And so we will be patient and look for the results. And I think we will be excited by what we see.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Mike. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: And the next caller is Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAaron Gal: Hi good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. The first one is around the N3pG4 in RLAD, you are starting a second agent fairly quickly. Can you talk about other distinguishing features for this product versus donanemab. Is it just that removes BlackFester, also the others? For example, is it removing preferentially parenteral plaque versus vascular plaque. And the second, you kind of mentioned your expectation for the NCD, but can you confirm to us that you do not expect the NCD to materially change in its final form versus a draft form? And if you can talk a little bit about the process of requesting a change to that entity once we have confirmatory data for the amyloid beta removing drugs.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ronny. We will go to Dan for the first question on N3pG4 and then Anne for the question on the NCD expectations.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Ronny. On N3pG4, originally, we started working on this molecule because of antidrug antibodies that we saw and continue to see against donanemab. Because of those ADAs, we have dosed donanemab at pretty high levels and that, in combination with the formulation of donanemab, have precluded the ability of generating a subcutaneous dosing form. So that was an important consideration of those two things, I would say, for development of N3pG4. It binds the same epitope as donanemab, so our understanding and data suggests that it clears exactly the same types of plaques. That is important to us. I think we have seen compelling efficacy here in TRAILBLAZER from donanemab, and we want more of the same in the next molecule. So no differences here in type of plaque. I think speed of plaque removal, our expectations are it should be similar to donanemab, which is to say, quite rapid. And the big advantage here is likely to be around dosing and administration.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anne?\nAnne White: Well, thanks, Ronny. We believe more than likely, the final NCD in April may not change very much. Really what matters most to us is ensuring rapid availability of donanemab for patients with that confirmatory Phase III data. And so that is going to be our focus with CMS. We believe that well-designed and controlled registration trials like TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 should certainly provide sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for donanemab and that the CD is not needed or appropriate for donanemab. We are also going to see confirmation with CMS really to your question, once this Phase III efficacy and safety have been established, that donanemab and other medicines with this level of verified evidence, would be fully covered by CMS, and we want that path for this coverage to be clearly laid out. As Dan mentioned, it may take some months after the Tyvyt 2 readout to work through that, we will certainly focus on that. We have been and will continue to meet with CMS to make our points known and to work through what that process is. And I think as Dan alluded to, what we believe is that with Phase III confirmatory data and ultimately, an FDA traditional approval, we cannot envision a reason why CMS would treat Alzheimer\u2019s disease differently than any other class of medicines. I mean this would really be unprecedented. And I believe the pushback from the patient community from their caregivers and from those that advocate for them would be significant and CMS would have, we believe, no choice but to change it. So our focus is on that Phase III data.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Ronny, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next caller is Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: His great. thanks for taking the question. Maybe one follow-up on ondonanemab and then one other 1 unrelated. So in terms of - obviously, I appreciate what you are saying around the accelerated approval and kind of changing your time line there. I\u2019m just wondering what TRAILBLAZER 4 and if there is any reason, I\u2019m kind of wondering what the rationale for that trial is now given the limited uptake of Aduhelm to this point, we will get data later this year. But I\u2019m just wondering if it makes - if there is any sort of change in strategy or thinking around the need for that trial? And what exactly that might accomplish? And then my second question is sort of unrelated. You mentioned around Olumiant, the updates from last week, but you also have submitted for alopecia areata. I\u2019m just wondering if you could maybe just talk a little bit about what you see for the potential, I guess, for the JAK class overall in that space, but also for Olumiant, specifically, just given obviously the safety concerns we have seen around that product in the class from before?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Dan for the question on TRAILBLAZER 4 I and then Patrik for your question on alopecia areata.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Vamil. You raised a good point on TRAILBLAZER 4, which is a head-to-head against Aduhelm. Of course, there was a lot of excitement in patient interest and investigator interest in this trial because there is two drugs compared to each other. So on the other hand, as you point out, from a commercial perspective, the importance of showing superiority to Aduhelm may have dramatically diminished. But that is okay. We are still committed to doing this trial. I think from a scientific perspective, there will be important conclusions. We have a hypothesis, for example, that the more rapid and deep plaque clearance could lead to greater improvements on biomarkers. I think those kinds of assessments can only be done in a head-to-head study. So this will still be an important contribution to our overall understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Patrik?\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much for the question. When we submitted Olumiant for alopecia areata to the FDA late last year, and it is now submitted post the European and the Japanese regulatory bodies, but are currently no treatments approved by alopecia areata, we have an opportunity here to be first in disease with Olumiant. And we have been encouraged with the data that we have seen from both BRAVE-1 and BRAVE-2, both based upon physician assessment as well as self assessment by patients. And that is truly an unmet need in this space. We have currently approximately 360,000 patients diagnosed in the U.S., and we believe that at least 100,000 of those would be eligible for the treatment with JAK. And based upon the profile that we have seen from other assets, we believe that we can launch here with a competitive profile to help patients with alopecia areata.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Patrick. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nStephen Scala: Thank you. I assume that you are deep in labeling discussions on tirzepatide. What questions is FDA asking? Are you anticipating the label to read that tirzepatide is a first-line injectable or for use after other injectables fail? And since another very well managed diabetes competitor has had supply issues, I\u2019m curious where tirzepatide is being manufactured and whether the plant has been inspected.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We will go to Mike Mason for both of those questions.\nMichael Mason: Thanks, Steve, for the question. The tirzepatide submission in the U.S. is going quite well. No surprises in that. We are not getting any unusual questions. We are confident in our supply and confident in our supply chain, we will be ready for launch. We did a comprehensive studies for our SURPASS-5 pivotal studies for the U.S. So I think that will give us a broad label and the label we need for success. So I think are progressing quite nicely. We are quite confident going into our launch.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Mike. Thanks for your question Steve. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Schott: Great, thanks so much. Maybe just following up on the tirzepatide front. Can you just help maybe also set some expectations of the launch as we think about 2022 into 2023? So maybe specifically, how long should we think about post approval until you would expect broad coverage of tirzepatide? And when we maybe compare and contrast, I guess the last large GLP-1s launch of Ozempic, are there similarities or differences we should think about as hint kind of stay on the market today, the data you will have, et cetera, just to help us - I think we all think about this is a great long-term opportunity, but more just the near-term dynamics with that. And then my second question was just on insulin in 2022. Can you just elaborate a bit more about how to think about the magnitude of price erosion we could see for that franchise relative to what we saw in 2021? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how different is the market dynamic, I guess, this year versus last?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for both of those questions as well.\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. As we approach the tirzepatide launch, we will be planning for the long term and making sure that we set the foundations up strongly for long-term success. When you have a retail product like this that goes to nearly 100,000 primary care physicians as well as meeting broad access, there is little that you can do to really accelerate the launch in the first six months. We are also working to get access and having support programs so patients will have a good out-of-pocket experience at launch. And so I wouldn\u2019t look for the first six months to see a real accelerated uptake of net revenue versus other GLPs in that first six months. I think that, that will be a focus for us of just laying a strong foundations, be in patient focus, getting access, driving awareness through a broad subset of physicians that will give us that foundation to be successful long term. And then on insulin, when we look at the Q4 results, we did have a, in particular, a greater-than-usual decline in our price. And that was really due to kind of a double whammy effect. We have a significant adjustments from our gross sales to our net sales. And so if our estimates are off just a little bit, that could have a significant impact on our net revenues. And so what we saw actually was that in the comparison period, in Q4 of 2020, they experienced some positive onetime gains. And then in this quarter, we saw some negative onetime adjustments. So that is what led to what looks like a greater-than-expected net sales decline. I think for our portfolio, we have provided guidance that we would be at about mid-single-digit decline. I think we will see that greater for insulin than our net portfolio, but I don\u2019t see anything largely unexpected in 2022 versus where we have seen the trends over the last couple of years. Thank you.\nDavid Ricks: Maybe just to add something there, Chris, that is a dynamic as well as patient assistance. And as you know, Lilly has led over the last three years with a number of solutions to reduce out-of-pocket costs given the problems in the insurance markets. And those have been - in addition to the normal competitive dynamics in terms of gross to net, an important solution for patients actually out-of-pocket costs for - correct me, Mike, if I get this wrong, for patients in the U.S. dropped over the last three years from $34 to $21 per month on average for Lilly insulins. That is quite a bit lower than our competitors, but that does hit the price line for us, either through the now 70% off insulin lispro product, which is available or through the buydowns we do at the point of sale to $35 per month. So that is in the background. There is sort of a terminal quantity to that, but we have seen good adoption. And I guess the good news is patients are taking advantage of that and it is showing up and retaining volume, it does hit the net price line though.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Dave. Chris thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlice Nettleton: This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. So a question on donanemab. The premise of donanemab is that you only dose to plaque negativity. However, to determine plaque negativity, you need a minimum of two PET scan and quite possibly three, maybe even more. The CMS draft guidance only covers one even if it ultimately gets revised to be more generous. If it doesn\u2019t also include increased coverage of PET scanning, then you could argue Lilly is uniquely disadvantaged versus competitors. Would be curious to hear your thoughts on this.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Alice. We will go to Anne White for that question.\nAnne White: Well, thanks. And as you said, we are pleased that CMS acknowledged that there is an important role for amyloid PET in patient identification. We certainly agreed to that as well. And using amyloid PET to monitor plaque reduction and then confirm clearance is incredibly important, we believe, for patients receiving these therapies. And incredibly important for the health care system because it provides clarity as to when you can essentially stopped dosing of medicine. Once you have cleared the target, we believe that is the time to stop dosing. And as you know, in our data, we have shown that 40% even clear their plaque in six months. So incredibly important and we believe that the value that, that brings to the health care system far outweighs any cost that it might bring. And we have done those analyses. So it is very, very clear that when you take into account all the costs of these medicines, the infusion, the safety monitoring, you are much better off with clarity of when that plaque is cleared and stopping dosing. It is a unique attribute of donanemab that we have certainly talked to CMS and others about and they have recognized. So we believe the value proposition here is quite strong and look forward to working with CMS to get the amyloid PET CED revised in the near future.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Anne. Alice thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next caller is Andrew Baum with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A question on lebrikizumab and then one on Verzenio. So on lebrikizumab, part of the premise in terms of differentiation versus dupi given the IL-3 mechanism is a lower instance of ocular events, particularly conjunctivitis, which are frequent with dupi and patient problematic. I know you haven\u2019t fully shared the data, but I wonder whether you could talk to whether the data will support that premise and positioning in the market. And then second, in relation to Verzenio, given you are now rolling it out for the adjuvant setting, could you talk to what are the key barriers to adoption among oncologists? Is it tolerability in the augment setting? Is it screening for the Ki-67 patients or some are financial factors and how can you resolve them?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. We will go to Patrik for the question on lebrikizumab and then Jake for the question on Verzenio.\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Andrew. Based upon the data that we have seen so far, we believe that we have a competitive asset with a market leader for atopic dermatitis, and we were very encouraged with the efficacy results with more than 50% of the patients achieving at least an EASI of 75 and also consistent across all the different measures, IgAA, EASI9 and RS and met all the key secondary end points. Specific to your question on [indiscernible], we need to wait for the 52-week data. In the induction data, we didn\u2019t see any difference to existing biologics. But the cases that we saw were all mild to moderate and one/third of those had a history of chonictybitis and only a few of them discontinued treatment. So we are looking forward to the database lock of the maintenance treatment during the first half of this year.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Patrik. Jake?\nJacob Van Naarden: Yes, thanks for the question. So I think as it relates to the key barriers to adoption, I think the biggest one in the overlay, and then I will get more specific is just that this represents really the first new standard of care in this setting in 20 years. And so there are just a lot of physicians who have entrenched behavior and comfort with what they are doing. And so the first barrier is really around education and getting a comfort level changing behavior. And so that - we have a lot of tactics in place to do that to make sure that the data on the agent are known and to answer questions that physicians may have. More specifically, you highlighted a few things that are good things to know, which is the Ki-67 testing requirement and the interpretation of those results and integrating them into patient selection is a new thing for docs in this setting. As well as the diarrhea management, which is a real phenomenon with Verzenio. We have protocols in place that allow it to be managed and it tends to be a short-term short-term side effect that can be managed. But there are a lot of physicians out there who have literally never written a prescription of Verzenio because they have been historically large Ibrance users. And for that segment, in particular, there is an education component to get them comfortable and ensure they are using the protocols that we think work really well for diarrhea management. That all having been said, we are happy with what we are seeing so far, but it is early days, obviously, in this launch trajectory.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Jake. Andrew thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Just have a couple of quick ones. For tirzepatide in obesity, what investments have to be made to help evolve the payer attitudes towards obesity as more of a medical condition, obviously, it has a lot to do with benefit risk, starting with SURMOUNT-1 and you have a competitor leading the charge as well. And then the second question is for partibrutinib. Was the decision to file an MCL, was it based more on unmet need and the opportunity versus regulatory feedback? I want to get a little bit more clarity on that. And with the Phase IIIs and CLL not completing for at least a few years, was there more consideration for those towards an interim look being built in? I\u2019m just trying to think of the potential lag in commercial availability between the two indications.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Geoff. We will go to Mike for the first question and then Jake for the second.\nMichael Mason: Yes, it is a good question on BC and what is going to take to unlock and build that marketplace. When you look at historically, the agent just had kind of limited weight loss. And because of that, they didn\u2019t really drive good help outcomes and that limited access, limited positions from writing that. So we think, first of all, just having agent like tirzepatide that could have significant and clinically meaningful weight loss is the first step of the evolution of the marketplace and the interest in that and we have seen that in market research. And then we have got to begin to build the evidence to show that significant weight loss for tirzepatide will lead to hard outcomes. And that is what we are doing in our extended indication focus. We have announced a heart failure HFpEF study. We announced in December a sleep apnea study as well as an important morbidity/mortality study or MMO study that will look at hard outcomes for other potential outcomes like CV and others, we will give you more information on that coming up. We also have a chronic kidney disease mechanism of action Phase II study that will help demonstrate why tirzepatide may work for that patient population and doing work in NASH. And so I think it is important for us to demonstrate. I think we are confident that with the level of weight loss that we will see with tirzepatide, but that should lead to hard outcomes, that should then lead to earlier use of agent like tirzepatide to really slow and disrupt the progression of obesity and really turn this into a more of a preventive versus waiting for the heart outcomes to show. But that is going to be the evolution of it. We have got an extensive Phase III program in order to demonstrate the evidence we think we need to - in order to unlock and grow access over time.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Jake, on pirtobrutinib?\nJacob Van Naarden: Yes. So the first part of your question around the decision to file for mantle cell, you framed it as what is an unmet need versus regulatory feedback. And the answer really is both. So we have had a longitudinal conversation with the agency around this indication showing them our clinical data at various snapshots over time. And we got to a point where we had agreement on the key components of what an NDA could look like from a clinical package perspective. And so that informed our decision to file. In other words, this was not a sort of unilateral Lilly decision. This was done very much in concert with FDA. And I think they and us realized the unmet need of patients in the setting and the potential proposition of pirtobrutinib there. Obviously, the ultimate approval is subject to an FDA review. So nothing is done until it is done, of course. As it relates to the potential lag between a mantle cell approval and CLL approval, I think it is just too early to really comment because the latter, CLL is really subject to the enrollment dynamics of the Phase III program. And it is just a little too early days for us to really say exactly which one of those studies will be the first to read out and when, because it is so enrollment kinetics-contingent. So over the course of this year, we will have a lot more information about that, I presume and be in a better position to prognosticate about CLL timing.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Jake. Geoff thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next caller is Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi thanks for taking my questions. So my first question is on lebrikizumab. If it is approved, do you expect sales to come from share gains from DUPIXENT or new patient starts? And then second question is on pirtobrutinib. Do you see an opportunity for the drug in first-line treatment? And if so, do you think you need to wait for the head-to-head results before that becomes a meaningful opportunity for you?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Louise. We will go to Patrik for the question on lebrikizumab\u2019s source of business and then back to Jake on pirtobrutinib.\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Louise. I think first and foremost, if you look at the atopic dermatitis state, it is pretty much where psoriasis was a decade ago. And we see a very low biologic penetration into those patients in need of treatment beyond topicals today. So we definitely see an opportunity to significantly grow the market in atopic dermatitis. But as I mentioned earlier, we also believe that we have an asset here, but it is very competitive with a market leader. So I would foresee that we will see an uptick both in terms of - driven by market growth as well as competing very successfully with the peak end.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Patrick. Jake.\nJacob Van Naarden: So the pirtobrutinib opportunity we see primarily and certainly initially is in patients who have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor or more. Obviously, we think there is a potential for the drug in the first line, and that is why we are running studies there. We have two studies that we are running in first-line CLL. One is, as you mentioned, a head-to-head study against ibrutinib. The other, which will take a long time to read out because of the natural history of the control arm. The other is a study we just recently started against chemoimmunotherapy. That study will read out much, much quicker. And, therefore, allow for the drug to be labeled in the first-line setting. And I think what we have learned, particularly from other newer entrants in this space is that you really need to generate a differentiating data set in some way, shape or form, and then have the labeled indications that allow physicians and patients to have choice. And I think, in particular, the Calquence acalabrutinib program has shown that you really actually don\u2019t necessarily need direct head-to-head data to suggest differentiation or for at least physicians to perceive differentiation in different drugs, so long as you have a labeled indication that allows for on-label prescribing and reimbursement. So one of the reasons that we initiated the first-line chemo immunotherapy study was to have a path to that first-line label more quickly and allow patients and physicians to make choices.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Jake. Louise thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is UmerRaffat with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nMichael DiFiore: This is Mike in for Umer. Just two for me. One on tirzepatide. If tirzepatide is priced at a slight premium over Trulicity on a list basis, that could theoretically mean a massive increase on a net basis. So given where prices are paid in government channels for Trulicity, can you remind us what percent of Trulicity is Medicare, Medicaid and VA? And how different is that price versus your commercial price? And switching gears to donanemab for TRAILBLAZER 3, I was wondering if you guys had finalized the stat methodology for assessing the primary endpoint. I know a little while back, you had a nice poster on TRAILBLAZER 2 showing how the primary endpoints were assessed by basin analysis versus MMRN. Just kind of remind us where - if anything has been finalized for the methodology for assessing the primary endpoint in TRAILBLAZER 3?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. We will go to Mike Mason for the questions around tirzepatide pricing and Trulicity segments in the U.S. and then Dan for the question on TRAILBLAZER 3. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Thanks, Mike, for your question. Obviously, I won\u2019t be able to talk in too much detail around the list price for next price for tirzepatide. Maybe the best way to answer your question is that typically for a new product, you tend to get commercial access first, then Part D, then followed by Medicaid and other channels. And yes, the commercial net prices are typically higher than Part D and Part D is typically higher than Medicaid. So you will see kind of the evolution of any retail product to be a higher net price at the beginning of the life cycle. And then as the lower - if you reach volume in lower-priced segments, you will see that decline like we have talked about over - with Trulicity over the last couple of years. Now we will have extensive patient support programs in the first six months for tirzepatide. So again, I wouldn\u2019t be looking too much at that for tirzepatide in the first six months. But overall, over the first couple of years, I think any product, you will see that dynamic. For your specific question on Medicaid, with Trulicity, that is currently around 10% of the volume. Thanks for the question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question on TRAILBLAZER 3. It is a good question you have raised because this is a really interesting population. These are patients who have amyloid plaque in their brain, but they are still cognitively normal. So what kind of endpoint is appropriate for a population like that. In our view, we are looking at a progression metrics. So do they progress to a CDR rating that indicates that they now have impairment. So it is a bit of a binary outcome for each patient. Did they progress or did they not progress? And then you have an event-driven study with Kaplan-Meier type analysis. So that is how we are thinking about TRAILBLAZER 3 right now and probably we haven\u2019t published this timetable yet, but that may yet be forthcoming, and that study is currently enrolling.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Dan. Mike thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Carter Gould with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: I guess just first for Dan. Maybe to clarify, I mean the language you are using around no longer Q1, I noticed - I guess you guys weren\u2019t explicitly confirming to 2Q. So just maybe just clarifying then, is that sort of time unknown, just still sometime in 2022? Or is it just going to kind of fill over by a couple of weeks or months. And then maybe for Jake, on Tyvyt, when we spoke in December, I thought you were pretty balanced. It is not even maybe negative on the prospects for approval based on some of the commentary around data coming out of China. Now that you have got the questions in hand, I don\u2019t know if your stance has changed or if you have any additional color to add. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Carter. We will go to Dan for the question on donanemab and then Jake on sintilimab in the U.S.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Carter. Exactly, you noted it correctly, which is that we are saying no longer Q1 and not providing a more specificity than that. We do anticipate completing the submission yet this year. I think importantly here, we are trying to take investor focus off of like the exact timing of accelerated approval, given our very limited expectations for the impact of that accelerated approval commercially. We are still pursuing it. We think there is some opportunity to help patients faster through it. But I don\u2019t think investors should look at that as a big commercial inflection point. It is really around our ability to communicate the TRAILBLAZER 2 confirmatory Phase III data and then work with CMS, hopefully, before that or immediately after that to make sure there is access once we have that confirmatory data. So that is the timing, I think investors should be focused on.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Jake?\nJacob Van Naarden: Thanks for the question on sintilimab. So as you know, we have the FDA Advisory Committee meeting with Invent a week from today. Our position on the matter really hasn\u2019t changed nor have our expectations. But we believe that the risk/benefit of the agent is demonstrable on the basis of the well-conducted study and we believe the results of the study are indeed applicable to a U.S. population. And we will make our case in that respect a week from today. That having been said, we understand the stance of the agency may have changed or maybe we may have misinterpreted it a few years ago. And so will await the FDA\u2019s presentation on that topic and the feedback from the ODAC members. But we think this product, if approved, could be meaningful for patients in the United States as a result of our disruptive pricing strategy. But we obviously don\u2019t know if we will be able to execute on that.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Jake. Carter thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nKerry Holford: Hi thank you. Two questions, please. Firstly, on Olumiant, I wonder if you could break out for us a proportion of sales in the quarter that were related to use in COVID and what your expectations are here going forth. And also whether you can expand on the discussions you have had with the FDA on the atopic dermatitis indication and why you think scale out could be forthcoming? If additional studies would it be required, would you continue to pursue in this indication? And then secondly, on the inflammation, we obviously have the positive headline data from the Phase III. So I\u2019m wondering when you will publish the full data and whether we will get to see that ahead of your filings.\nKevin Hern: Okay. Thanks, Kerry. We will go to Patrik for those questions.\nPatrik Jonsson: Okay. Thank you very much. Let\u2019s start with Olumiant in COVID-19. If you look at the Q4 performance of Olumiant, I think you should assume that the underlying business in rheumatoid arthritis outside of U.S. and atopic dermatitis continue to be strong. And in the U.S., the trend hasn\u2019t changed either when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis. In the U.S., a significant chunk of sales from Olumiant is coming from COVID-19 in Q4 and a minor chunk outside of the U.S. as well. It is really hard to predict the pandemic, but we expect to see continued sales from Olumiant also in 2022 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, at an enterprise level, we don\u2019t foresee it to be material. For your second question in terms of atopic dermatitis, let me first reinforce that we are very confident when it comes to the risk benefit profile of Olumiant across all the indications approved and studied. And we conducted eight Phase III studies for atopic dermatitis in U.S. and outside of the U.S. And those were conducted in patients, moderate to severely ill patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in need of systemic treatment. And that is really where we believe Olumiant is bringing the biggest benefits to patients early on in the treatment data time. While FDA currently has a position of saving Olumiant for the refractory patients where we see the incremental value of Olumiant to be quite limited. And if that doesn\u2019t change, it is likely that we will receive a complete response letter. And if so, we will continue to focus our efforts on the very successful launches that we have seen outside the U.S. for atopic dermatitis as well as a very strong rheumatoid arthritis franchise. We have - as well as preparing for, hopefully, an approval of Alopecia Areata in the U.S. and other markets later on this year. Moving on to mirikizumab. Yes, we had recently the readout of LUSN2 just prior to the end of last year. And we met the primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints. And we didn\u2019t only achieve statistical significance, but also clinically meaningful difference when it comes to clinical, symptomatic, hetologic and endoscopic measures. And we have also conducted the first study ever with an IL-23 P19 where we have demonstrated reduced urgency, which we know is a major concern today for both clinicians, but mainly for patients. So therefore, we are looking forward to submit mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis during the first half of this year. And most likely become the first IL-23 19 in this very important space and we have a big unmet need and with a profile that we believe is very competitive versus both currently approved medicines and other biologics and JAKs in development.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Patrik. Kerry thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next caller is Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you very much. A question about the timeline plans for filing for dMAB. It is been an arena of influence from different parties agency, CMS, where it appears as if there is sort of instruction that have breadth of scope across multiple different antibody. So would you say that since we know that competitor data is upcoming for additional approaches later this year, does that impact your view on your approach and timing for filing a DMAB? And then a second question would be on tirzepatide, the anticipated transition in type 2 diabetes. Trulicity has been very strong. But can you perhaps give us a better sense about how you expect that transition to play out? I think broadly, there is confidence in the profile that tirzepatide eventually will succeed in continuing the franchise position in type 2 diabetes. But would you expect for the initial tirzepatide launch that to come primarily and importantly, from the incident population or will there be patient switching? A little insight into how that actual transition could play out in your view would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We will go to Dan for the question around donanemab filing timelines and then Mike for the transition with Trulicity and tirzepatide franchises.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks Chris, you raised a good point with competitor readouts for amyloid-lowering drugs coming yet this year. We have to take into account expectations for those readouts. I think from our perspective, those readouts could be challenging. Obviously, we designed donanemab as a molecule or dosing strategy, our clinical trial strategy, including who we enrolled and what endpoints we look at in order to maximize the ability to see a positive signal. Other trials haven\u2019t done that. So therefore, it is obvious that we would think that those trials should have lower probability of success. . I think if those trials are not successful, competitor readouts fail either because see some of the boxes is just too noisy an endpoint. And that can go ways it could help or it could hurt. We saw that in the two aducanumab readouts or because they have too many patients who are outside the optimal window of tau pathology because they are not doing that or because they lower plaques too slowly. If any of those turn out to be correct and those trials turn out to be negative, I think that could further solidify CMS\u2019s reluctance to reimburse these drugs under accelerated approval. It doesn\u2019t really fundamentally change our thinking, though. As I said before, the key event for us is readout of our Phase III study. I think we have optimized everything for our chances of success. And regardless of competitor readouts, if we have a positive Phase III readout on top of our already first positive randomized controlled trial in TRAILBLAZER 1 that is a very good position for donanemab and our expectation is that is a drug that will become globally available to patients and highly used by patients.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question on Trulicity and tirzepatide. We are blessed to have both products. We are going to be taken, again, from a long-term perspective on tirzepatide and Trulicity. Our goal is to continue to grow the market in type 2 diabetes and then really expand the class into the obesity market. Within type 2 diabetes, our goal not only is to expand the market, but continue to expand our share of market within the market. . When you look at the way we promote our products, we take a very patient-centric approach to identifying those patients who could best benefit from a product like tirzepatide. In our market research as we put the profile of tirzepatide up against the six therapies, including Trulicity, both payers and health care professionals and people who live with diabetes see the superior profile of tirzepatide. When you compare that Trulicity, our Phase III trials that showed greater weight loss, better A1c control and it is in exact same device as Trulicity. So there is obviously interest in the product, and they do see it as a superior product from Trulicity. Now what I believe will happen is that we will grow our overall share, and you will get a portion of patients who may have gone on Trulicity or may be on Trulicity and maybe out of control who needs greater weight loss or greater A1c control and those patients will grow on tirzepatide. So we do anticipate that there will be some conversion from Trulicity over two tirzepatide, but our focus is really going to be making sure that we grow the overall class and grow the overall share of market for the Lilly Ancrogen franchise. We don\u2019t think it is appropriate to necessarily promote conversion of products, we are doing well on Trulicity. So it is not going to be a kind of internally focused conversion strategy. It is going to be very much a patient-focused product for those patients who are out of control or need additional weight loss tirzepatide can offer that. So we are quite excited about the opportunity to have two intro trends in our portfolio and grow the overall class. Thank you for the question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks Mike. Chris thanks for your question. Next caller please.\nOperator: The next call is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nKevin Hern: Alright. Well, if Evan is not there, the queue is exhausted. We will go to Dave for the close.\nDavid Ricks: Okay. Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone\u2019s participation in today\u2019s earnings call and of course, your interest in our Company. 2021 was an incredible year for the Company, as we produced strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients who rely on us. We entered 2022 with positive momentum and great focus on execution to deliver on the meaningful opportunities we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in today, and please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call. Have a good one. Take care.",

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full-year 2021. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q4, revenue grew 8% and revenue, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, increased 6%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Full-year revenue growth was 10% on that latter basis. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 250 basis points to 76.1% in Q4. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven by higher sales of COVID-19 antibodies, with shipments this quarter of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, also having lower gross margin profile compared to bevalinuzumab sales in the base period. Total operating expenses grew 5% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, while R&D expenses increased 7%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage pipeline opportunities, including donanemab, pirtobrutinib and tirzepatide, which were partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 therapies. We invested approximately $40 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q4, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $400 million for the full-year. Operating income increased 3% compared to Q4 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 31.7% for the quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points. This decrease was driven by lower gross margin percent, partially offset by lower marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue. Full-year operating margin was 29.9%, in line with our expectations. Other income and expense was an expense of approximately $7 million this quarter compared to an expense of $31 million in Q4 2020. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 10.3%, a decrease of 280 basis points driven primarily by net discrete tax benefits. At the bottom line, we delivered solid growth as earnings per share - 8% in Q4 and 20% for the full-year. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth, and we continue to be encouraged by the growth seen across key geographies. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 13%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This growth driven by volume was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. The net price decline of 2% in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower realized prices for insulins, primarily due to changes to estimates for rebates and discounts. For the full-year, our U.S. net price decrease of 1% was in line with our expectations. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4 declined 3% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, revenue grew 11% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Olumiant, Taltz and Verzenio. We are encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe, and expect continued growth excluding Alimta. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 14% in constant currency. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity including Cymbalta and Alimta as well as by the COVID pandemic. With key growth products now representing 56% of total Japan revenue, we expect to return to growth beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 13% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume from our continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity as well as the timing of supply for Cialis through the third-party selling the product. Q4 revenue growth was negatively affected by the updated 2022 NRDL price reductions on inventory already in the channel especially for Tyvyt. In 2022, we expect the NRDL price reduction headwind largely offset volume growth in Q1, but we also expect volume growth to accelerate throughout the year and exceed the impact of these price reductions. Moving forward, we are excited about the significant growth we are seeing in China, over 40% in constant currency in 2021, with improved access expected to continue to drive future growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by sales of neuro medicine. We continue to expect a mid-single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan. In China, the expanded NRDL access for our products should lead to significant volume increase, but also high double-digit decline in price. As a result, we expect total company net price decline in the high single digit in 2022. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effect on revenue for all 2021, which shows strong double-digit volume-driven revenue growth across most major geographies. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 14 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to bolster our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated over $4.2 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue. In Q4, these newer medicines grew by 28% and Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz and Verzenio all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are particularly pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and the SGLT2 classes, where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders. We are also encouraged by the strong uptake of Verzenio we saw in Q4, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2021, we invested 9.3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately 3.1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased approximately 1.3 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged as we continue to fund our marketed products and expected launches, invest in our pipeline, evaluate opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 13 is our 2022 financial guidance we issued in December. As I shared then, the financial impact from the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in Europe and Japan will continue in the first half of 2022. While the impact from Alimta's U.S. patent expiry will start with the limited launch from a single generic company in Q1 before the full launch of additional generic entrants starting in Q2. We expect roughly 375 million of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies in Q1 from the shipment of the remaining doses attributable to last November's U.S. Government Purchase Agreement. We continue to invest in our bright future, advance in promising R&D opportunities and preparing for exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline, which we believe will help drive top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Ronny. We believe more than likely, the final NCD in April may not change very much. Really what matters most to us is ensuring rapid availability of donanemab for patients with that confirmatory Phase III data. And so that is going to be our focus with CMS. We believe that well-designed and controlled registration trials like TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and ALZ 2 should certainly provide sufficient evidence of clinical benefit for donanemab and that the CD is not needed or appropriate for donanemab. We are also going to see confirmation with CMS really to your question, once this Phase III efficacy and safety have been established, that donanemab and other medicines with this level of verified evidence, would be fully covered by CMS, and we want that path for this coverage to be clearly laid out. As Dan mentioned, it may take some months after the Tyvyt 2 readout to work through that, we will certainly focus on that. We have been and will continue to meet with CMS to make our points known and to work through what that process is. And I think as Dan alluded to, what we believe is that with Phase III confirmatory data and ultimately, an FDA traditional approval, we cannot envision a reason why CMS would treat Alzheimer's disease differently than any other class of medicines. I mean this would really be unprecedented. And I believe the pushback from the patient community from their caregivers and from those that advocate for them would be significant and CMS would have, we believe, no choice but to change it. So our focus is on that Phase III data. Well, thanks. And as you said, we are pleased that CMS acknowledged that there is an important role for amyloid PET in patient identification. We certainly agreed to that as well. And using amyloid PET to monitor plaque reduction and then confirm clearance is incredibly important, we believe, for patients receiving these therapies. And incredibly important for the health care system because it provides clarity as to when you can essentially stopped dosing of medicine. Once you have cleared the target, we believe that is the time to stop dosing. And as you know, in our data, we have shown that 40% even clear their plaque in six months. So incredibly important and we believe that the value that, that brings to the health care system far outweighs any cost that it might bring. And we have done those analyses. So it is very, very clear that when you take into account all the costs of these medicines, the infusion, the safety monitoring, you are much better off with clarity of when that plaque is cleared and stopping dosing. It is a unique attribute of donanemab that we have certainly talked to CMS and others about and they have recognized. So we believe the value proposition here is quite strong and look forward to working with CMS to get the amyloid PET CED revised in the near future."

            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thank you, Anat. 2021 was a remarkable year for Lilly's pipeline. We delivered positive data on 5 molecules: tirzepatide, tenenumab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, all of which have the potential to launch in the next two years, and we are excited about the potential of these molecules hold for patients. In addition, we launched and submitted several key new indications for in-market products, including important new indications for Verzenio and Jardiance. And also, we advanced our early-stage pipeline. Just a few weeks-ago, we provided an extensive R&D update across our therapeutic areas and shared our excitement about the next wave of innovation coming from Lilly. As a result, today's R&D update will be brief and focus on the progress we have made since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 31, and Slides 15 and 16 show a recap of 2021 key events and potential key events for 2022. In Diabetes, with the recent submission in Japan, we have now submitted tirzepatide across all major geographies for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We look forward to potential approvals for this important medicine this year. We anticipate U.S. regulatory action in type 2 diabetes as well as the top line readout from SURMOUNT-1, both by midyear. In Japan, we submitted Jardiance for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and received approval for Jardiance for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Moving to Oncology. We shared encouraging updated data at ASH for pirtobrutinib for both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma. We continue to progress this molecule and initiated another Phase III study in first-line CLL comparing pirtobrutinib to chemoimmunotherapy. During our December meeting, we also announced the initiation of a rolling submission for pirtobrutinib for MCL in the U.S. We plan to complete this submission this year with anticipated regulatory action in early 2023, and we are excited to potentially bring this important medicine to patients on this accelerated timeline. For Verzenio, we received approval for high-risk early breast cancer in Japan for the Cohort 1 population study to monarchE and are pleased that this approval represents 90% of the intent-to-treat population. We have also made the difficult decision to terminate further enrollment in the Phase III study of Verzenio for HER2 positive early breast cancer in response to the changing treatment landscape and global enrollment challenges. Importantly, this decision does not change our commitment to and investment in breast cancer. In addition, we began a Phase III study for selpetatinib for the treatment of adjuvant RET-positive non-small cell lung cancer and we also dosed the first patient in the U.S. trial of our BCL-2 inhibitor. In Immunology, we announced positive top line data for our Phase III maintenance study of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. We are pleased that the study met all primary and key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to submissions in the first half of this year. We also announced positive top line Phase III results for lebrikizumab in combination with topical corticosteroids, and we are encouraged that data to date has demonstrated a competitive profile for treatment of atopic dermatitis. We await maintenance data for lebrikizumab in the first half of this year in advance of global submissions, which are expected by the end of 2022. Moving to baricitinib. We announced last week that based on top line efficacy results from two Phase III trials, we have decided to discontinue the Phase III development program for lupus. For atopic dermatitis in the U.S., we are in ongoing discussions with the FDA, but do not have alignment with the agency on the indicated population, which could possibly lead to a complete response letter. We expect regulatory action for this indication very soon. Finally, we have submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in the U.S. and hope it will become the first medicine approved for patients living with this disease later this year. In our early phase immunology portfolio, we started a new Phase I study for CD19 antibody and we have discontinued our oral IL-17 inhibitor. Moving to neurodegeneration. In our early-phase pipeline, we announced that we have received breakthrough therapy designation for N3pG4, an additional amyloid lowering agent for which we intend to initiate pivotal trials by the end of this year. We have evidence that this therapy is completely and rapidly cleared amyloid plaque and we are exploring flexible dosing regimens, including subcutaneous dosing. For the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, we also began a Phase II trial for our oglic/nacase inhibitor, an oral small molecule targeting tau. While donanemab has been a primary focus for investors, we are pleased with the continued clinical advancement of the rest of our neurodegeneration pipeline. Now turning to donanemab, in December, we initiated two additional Phase III studies, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, our prevention study for asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease; and TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head plaque clearance study compared to add-a-helm. It has been less than one year since we published a positive randomized controlled TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, which demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits on endpoints of cognition and function. Since then, we have focused investors on the need for replication from our well-designed expanded Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which is now fully enrolled and expected to read out in mid-2023. While a lot has happened in this space during this last year, and more events are likely before we get top line results next year, what hasn't changed for us is the importance of the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout and our confidence in both donanemab and the unique study design. Given the impact of this devastating disease, we believe that if TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 provides positive confirmatory data, we can't see a scenario where there is not global reimbursement, patient access and broad use of donanemab. We noted last year that we had low expectations for the use of donanemab during the period between potential accelerated approval and the availability of confirmatory Phase III data in mid-2023. We are disappointed with the position that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken in its draft national coverage determination decision, and those low expectations could now extend for some months beyond the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 readout if reconsideration of CMS coverage determination is required, given historical timelines for this process. While the accelerated approval pathway was instituted by the FDA to allow for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need, hence providing valuable access to more patients faster than what is available under clinical trials, the NCD is currently written essentially negates that patient benefit in Alzheimer's disease. Still, we intend to complete our application for accelerated approval for donanemab yet this year, but we now move completion of the accelerated approval submission out of Q1. We expect further volatility and expectations as competitor Alzheimer's disease trials read out prior to our definitive data. We remain confident in the differentiation of donanemab and in our uniquely designed TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. And importantly, the long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Lastly, with respect to our progress with COVID-19 therapies. Earlier this year, we submitted a request to the FDA for Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelimumab for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 and for patients at high risk for progression of severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This is the third antibody we have developed for the treatment of COVID-19, and authentic virus and pseudovirus assays demonstrate that bebtelovimab retains neutralization activity against Omicron as well as all other known variants of concern. We have produced several hundred thousand doses of bebtelovimab and stand ready to supply as needed if this antibody receives EUA from the FDA. In addition, we have also submitted a supplemental NDA for baricitinib for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and expect regulatory action by the middle of this year. Baricitinib currently has an EUA for this indication. We are proud of the therapies we have delivered to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to do our part as public health needs emerge. In summary, Q4 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly, capping what was an outstanding year of pipeline progress on behalf of patients. Now I will turn the call back to Dave. Thank you, Seamus. It is a good question. Look, I think, as I said, the purpose of accelerated approvals to try and get medicines and to help patients faster. Without access, that benefit is mainly negated, unfortunately, and clearly, a very frustrating period for patients to have approval of a drug and no reimbursement. So the CMS draft NCD proposal weighed heavily in our considerations around timing and clearly reduces some of the ability to help patients faster than we were hoping for the accelerated approval. With respect to the other part of your question, which is how about requests from the FDA or new data or anything like that, there are none of those factors here. We haven't had such requests. So it is really about CMS and about our own team's ability to just get all of the data together and get the right amount of safety data compiled in a way that the FDA can analyze. So we will continue to work towards accelerated approval yet this year, but no longer in Q1. Thanks, Ronny. On N3pG4, originally, we started working on this molecule because of antidrug antibodies that we saw and continue to see against donanemab. Because of those ADAs, we have dosed donanemab at pretty high levels and that, in combination with the formulation of donanemab, have precluded the ability of generating a subcutaneous dosing form. So that was an important consideration of those two things, I would say, for development of N3pG4. It binds the same epitope as donanemab, so our understanding and data suggests that it clears exactly the same types of plaques. That is important to us. I think we have seen compelling efficacy here in TRAILBLAZER from donanemab, and we want more of the same in the next molecule. So no differences here in type of plaque. I think speed of plaque removal, our expectations are it should be similar to donanemab, which is to say, quite rapid. And the big advantage here is likely to be around dosing and administration. Yes. Thanks, Vamil. You raised a good point on TRAILBLAZER 4, which is a head-to-head against Aduhelm. Of course, there was a lot of excitement in patient interest and investigator interest in this trial because there is two drugs compared to each other. So on the other hand, as you point out, from a commercial perspective, the importance of showing superiority to Aduhelm may have dramatically diminished. But that is okay. We are still committed to doing this trial. I think from a scientific perspective, there will be important conclusions. We have a hypothesis, for example, that the more rapid and deep plaque clearance could lead to greater improvements on biomarkers. I think those kinds of assessments can only be done in a head-to-head study. So this will still be an important contribution to our overall understanding of Alzheimer's disease. Yes. Thanks, Mike, for the question on TRAILBLAZER 3. It is a good question you have raised because this is a really interesting population. These are patients who have amyloid plaque in their brain, but they are still cognitively normal. So what kind of endpoint is appropriate for a population like that. In our view, we are looking at a progression metrics. So do they progress to a CDR rating that indicates that they now have impairment. So it is a bit of a binary outcome for each patient. Did they progress or did they not progress? And then you have an event-driven study with Kaplan-Meier type analysis. So that is how we are thinking about TRAILBLAZER 3 right now and probably we haven't published this timetable yet, but that may yet be forthcoming, and that study is currently enrolling. Yes. Thanks, Carter. Exactly, you noted it correctly, which is that we are saying no longer Q1 and not providing a more specificity than that. We do anticipate completing the submission yet this year. I think importantly here, we are trying to take investor focus off of like the exact timing of accelerated approval, given our very limited expectations for the impact of that accelerated approval commercially. We are still pursuing it. We think there is some opportunity to help patients faster through it. But I don't think investors should look at that as a big commercial inflection point. It is really around our ability to communicate the TRAILBLAZER 2 confirmatory Phase III data and then work with CMS, hopefully, before that or immediately after that to make sure there is access once we have that confirmatory data. So that is the timing, I think investors should be focused on. Thanks Chris, you raised a good point with competitor readouts for amyloid-lowering drugs coming yet this year. We have to take into account expectations for those readouts. I think from our perspective, those readouts could be challenging. Obviously, we designed donanemab as a molecule or dosing strategy, our clinical trial strategy, including who we enrolled and what endpoints we look at in order to maximize the ability to see a positive signal. Other trials haven't done that. So therefore, it is obvious that we would think that those trials should have lower probability of success. . I think if those trials are not successful, competitor readouts fail either because see some of the boxes is just too noisy an endpoint. And that can go ways it could help or it could hurt. We saw that in the two aducanumab readouts or because they have too many patients who are outside the optimal window of tau pathology because they are not doing that or because they lower plaques too slowly. If any of those turn out to be correct and those trials turn out to be negative, I think that could further solidify CMS's reluctance to reimburse these drugs under accelerated approval. It doesn't really fundamentally change our thinking, though. As I said before, the key event for us is readout of our Phase III study. I think we have optimized everything for our chances of success. And regardless of competitor readouts, if we have a positive Phase III readout on top of our already first positive randomized controlled trial in TRAILBLAZER 1 that is a very good position for donanemab and our expectation is that is a drug that will become globally available to patients and highly used by patients."

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "Thank you very much for the question. When we submitted Olumiant for alopecia areata to the FDA late last year, and it is now submitted post the European and the Japanese regulatory bodies, but are currently no treatments approved by alopecia areata, we have an opportunity here to be first in disease with Olumiant. And we have been encouraged with the data that we have seen from both BRAVE-1 and BRAVE-2, both based upon physician assessment as well as self assessment by patients. And that is truly an unmet need in this space. We have currently approximately 360,000 patients diagnosed in the U.S., and we believe that at least 100,000 of those would be eligible for the treatment with JAK. And based upon the profile that we have seen from other assets, we believe that we can launch here with a competitive profile to help patients with alopecia areata. Thank you very much, Andrew. Based upon the data that we have seen so far, we believe that we have a competitive asset with a market leader for atopic dermatitis, and we were very encouraged with the efficacy results with more than 50% of the patients achieving at least an EASI of 75 and also consistent across all the different measures, IgAA, EASI9 and RS and met all the key secondary end points. Specific to your question on [indiscernible], we need to wait for the 52-week data. In the induction data, we didn't see any difference to existing biologics. But the cases that we saw were all mild to moderate and one/third of those had a history of chonictybitis and only a few of them discontinued treatment. So we are looking forward to the database lock of the maintenance treatment during the first half of this year. Thank you very much, Louise. I think first and foremost, if you look at the atopic dermatitis state, it is pretty much where psoriasis was a decade ago. And we see a very low biologic penetration into those patients in need of treatment beyond topicals today. So we definitely see an opportunity to significantly grow the market in atopic dermatitis. But as I mentioned earlier, we also believe that we have an asset here, but it is very competitive with a market leader. So I would foresee that we will see an uptick both in terms of - driven by market growth as well as competing very successfully with the peak end. Okay. Thank you very much. Let's start with Olumiant in COVID-19. If you look at the Q4 performance of Olumiant, I think you should assume that the underlying business in rheumatoid arthritis outside of U.S. and atopic dermatitis continue to be strong. And in the U.S., the trend hasn't changed either when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis. In the U.S., a significant chunk of sales from Olumiant is coming from COVID-19 in Q4 and a minor chunk outside of the U.S. as well. It is really hard to predict the pandemic, but we expect to see continued sales from Olumiant also in 2022 for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, at an enterprise level, we don't foresee it to be material. For your second question in terms of atopic dermatitis, let me first reinforce that we are very confident when it comes to the risk benefit profile of Olumiant across all the indications approved and studied. And we conducted eight Phase III studies for atopic dermatitis in U.S. and outside of the U.S. And those were conducted in patients, moderate to severely ill patients suffering from atopic dermatitis in need of systemic treatment. And that is really where we believe Olumiant is bringing the biggest benefits to patients early on in the treatment data time. While FDA currently has a position of saving Olumiant for the refractory patients where we see the incremental value of Olumiant to be quite limited. And if that doesn't change, it is likely that we will receive a complete response letter. And if so, we will continue to focus our efforts on the very successful launches that we have seen outside the U.S. for atopic dermatitis as well as a very strong rheumatoid arthritis franchise. We have - as well as preparing for, hopefully, an approval of Alopecia Areata in the U.S. and other markets later on this year. Moving on to mirikizumab. Yes, we had recently the readout of LUSN2 just prior to the end of last year. And we met the primary endpoint and all the secondary endpoints. And we didn't only achieve statistical significance, but also clinically meaningful difference when it comes to clinical, symptomatic, hetologic and endoscopic measures. And we have also conducted the first study ever with an IL-23 P19 where we have demonstrated reduced urgency, which we know is a major concern today for both clinicians, but mainly for patients. So therefore, we are looking forward to submit mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis during the first half of this year. And most likely become the first IL-23 19 in this very important space and we have a big unmet need and with a profile that we believe is very competitive versus both currently approved medicines and other biologics and JAKs in development."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. We are excited to see this SURMOUNT-1 data. There is good theory on why someone who live with obesity would have greater weight loss on a product like tirzepatide than those that have type 2 diabetes. Those theories tend to play out when we looked at the novo semaglutides step program where those who didn't have type 2 diabetes had six or seven percentage points greater weight loss than those that had type 2 diabetes. We don't know what it is going to turn out to be for SURMOUNT-1. We do believe that it is going to be higher in the non-type 2 diabetes patient than what we saw in the SURPASS studies. Good thing is we don't have to wait too long for those results. We expect those in the first half of this year. And so we will be patient and look for the results. And I think we will be excited by what we see. Thanks, Steve, for the question. The tirzepatide submission in the U.S. is going quite well. No surprises in that. We are not getting any unusual questions. We are confident in our supply and confident in our supply chain, we will be ready for launch. We did a comprehensive studies for our SURPASS-5 pivotal studies for the U.S. So I think that will give us a broad label and the label we need for success. So I think are progressing quite nicely. We are quite confident going into our launch. Yes. Thanks for the question. As we approach the tirzepatide launch, we will be planning for the long term and making sure that we set the foundations up strongly for long-term success. When you have a retail product like this that goes to nearly 100,000 primary care physicians as well as meeting broad access, there is little that you can do to really accelerate the launch in the first six months. We are also working to get access and having support programs so patients will have a good out-of-pocket experience at launch. And so I wouldn't look for the first six months to see a real accelerated uptake of net revenue versus other GLPs in that first six months. I think that, that will be a focus for us of just laying a strong foundations, be in patient focus, getting access, driving awareness through a broad subset of physicians that will give us that foundation to be successful long term. And then on insulin, when we look at the Q4 results, we did have a, in particular, a greater-than-usual decline in our price. And that was really due to kind of a double whammy effect. We have a significant adjustments from our gross sales to our net sales. And so if our estimates are off just a little bit, that could have a significant impact on our net revenues. And so what we saw actually was that in the comparison period, in Q4 of 2020, they experienced some positive onetime gains. And then in this quarter, we saw some negative onetime adjustments. So that is what led to what looks like a greater-than-expected net sales decline. I think for our portfolio, we have provided guidance that we would be at about mid-single-digit decline. I think we will see that greater for insulin than our net portfolio, but I don't see anything largely unexpected in 2022 versus where we have seen the trends over the last couple of years. Thank you. Yes, it is a good question on BC and what is going to take to unlock and build that marketplace. When you look at historically, the agent just had kind of limited weight loss. And because of that, they didn't really drive good help outcomes and that limited access, limited positions from writing that. So we think, first of all, just having agent like tirzepatide that could have significant and clinically meaningful weight loss is the first step of the evolution of the marketplace and the interest in that and we have seen that in market research. And then we have got to begin to build the evidence to show that significant weight loss for tirzepatide will lead to hard outcomes. And that is what we are doing in our extended indication focus. We have announced a heart failure HFpEF study. We announced in December a sleep apnea study as well as an important morbidity/mortality study or MMO study that will look at hard outcomes for other potential outcomes like CV and others, we will give you more information on that coming up. We also have a chronic kidney disease mechanism of action Phase II study that will help demonstrate why tirzepatide may work for that patient population and doing work in NASH. And so I think it is important for us to demonstrate. I think we are confident that with the level of weight loss that we will see with tirzepatide, but that should lead to hard outcomes, that should then lead to earlier use of agent like tirzepatide to really slow and disrupt the progression of obesity and really turn this into a more of a preventive versus waiting for the heart outcomes to show. But that is going to be the evolution of it. We have got an extensive Phase III program in order to demonstrate the evidence we think we need to - in order to unlock and grow access over time. Thanks, Mike, for your question. Obviously, I won't be able to talk in too much detail around the list price for next price for tirzepatide. Maybe the best way to answer your question is that typically for a new product, you tend to get commercial access first, then Part D, then followed by Medicaid and other channels. And yes, the commercial net prices are typically higher than Part D and Part D is typically higher than Medicaid. So you will see kind of the evolution of any retail product to be a higher net price at the beginning of the life cycle. And then as the lower - if you reach volume in lower-priced segments, you will see that decline like we have talked about over - with Trulicity over the last couple of years. Now we will have extensive patient support programs in the first six months for tirzepatide. So again, I wouldn't be looking too much at that for tirzepatide in the first six months. But overall, over the first couple of years, I think any product, you will see that dynamic. For your specific question on Medicaid, with Trulicity, that is currently around 10% of the volume. Thanks for the question. Yes. Thanks for the question on Trulicity and tirzepatide. We are blessed to have both products. We are going to be taken, again, from a long-term perspective on tirzepatide and Trulicity. Our goal is to continue to grow the market in type 2 diabetes and then really expand the class into the obesity market. Within type 2 diabetes, our goal not only is to expand the market, but continue to expand our share of market within the market. . When you look at the way we promote our products, we take a very patient-centric approach to identifying those patients who could best benefit from a product like tirzepatide. In our market research as we put the profile of tirzepatide up against the six therapies, including Trulicity, both payers and health care professionals and people who live with diabetes see the superior profile of tirzepatide. When you compare that Trulicity, our Phase III trials that showed greater weight loss, better A1c control and it is in exact same device as Trulicity. So there is obviously interest in the product, and they do see it as a superior product from Trulicity. Now what I believe will happen is that we will grow our overall share, and you will get a portion of patients who may have gone on Trulicity or may be on Trulicity and maybe out of control who needs greater weight loss or greater A1c control and those patients will grow on tirzepatide. So we do anticipate that there will be some conversion from Trulicity over two tirzepatide, but our focus is really going to be making sure that we grow the overall class and grow the overall share of market for the Lilly Ancrogen franchise. We don't think it is appropriate to necessarily promote conversion of products, we are doing well on Trulicity. So it is not going to be a kind of internally focused conversion strategy. It is going to be very much a patient-focused product for those patients who are out of control or need additional weight loss tirzepatide can offer that. So we are quite excited about the opportunity to have two intro trends in our portfolio and grow the overall class. Thank you for the question."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. 2021 was another outstanding year for Lilly as we delivered strong top and bottom-line growth and positive pivotal readouts for five important assets with the potential to launch in the next two years. As we move into 2022, we continue to build on this foundation and are determined to deliver on our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth, expand operating margins and innovate to develop and launch new medicines for patients that address significant unmet needs. Unpacking our 2021 performance on Slide 4, you can see the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables. Q4 revenue was 8% and was driven by volume growth of 11%. While when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full-year. This volume-driven performance is attributable to our key growth products, which grew by 28% and now account for 61% of our core business in Q4. On our non-GAAP, gross margin was 76.1% in Q4, a decrease of approximately 250 basis points, driven by increased sales of COVID-19 antibodies, which have a lower gross margin profile. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 31.7%, representing a decrease of approximately 130 basis points as a result of the lower gross margin percent just mentioned. For pipeline milestones, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call, including additional positive Phase III readouts for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. The initiation of a rolling submission in the U.S. for pertibrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and our submission of bebtelizumab to the FDA for emergency use authorization for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value and recently announced our plans to make significant investments in new manufacturing sites in both North Carolina and Ireland. These investments will bolster the resilience and capacity of our supply chain as we launch new products to drive meaningful long-term growth. In addition, this quarter, we announced a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities as we continue to augment internal discovery capabilities. Finally, on financials, we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fourth consecutive year. And in Q4, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend and completed another $750 million in share repurchases. Moving to Slides 5 and 6, you will see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and COVID-19 therapy updates we are discussing today or that were part of the discussion during our December 15 Investment Community Meeting. So now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full-year 2021 results. Thanks, Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2021. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We continue to invest heavily in our pipeline and made significant progress in 2021 generating positive Phase III data for five new potential medicines: tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab that we expect we will launch in the next two years. We also delivered positive data and launched important new indications for Jardiance and Verzenio, while we continue to bolster our pipeline through business development with a focus on new modalities. Finally, we returned $4.35 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fourth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase. As we move into 2022, we are excited to continue the progress of turning pipeline value into cash flow, starting with the potential launch of tirzepatide and the submissions of donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. These opportunities remind us that our purpose has never been more relevant and highlight the promise of turning science into treatments or cures for some of the most challenging human diseases like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer's, cancers and autoimmune disorders. We are steadfast in our commitment to improve the lives of millions of patients who rely on us and are confident in our business outlook. So now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Maybe just to add something there, Chris, that is a dynamic as well as patient assistance. And as you know, Lilly has led over the last three years with a number of solutions to reduce out-of-pocket costs given the problems in the insurance markets. And those have been - in addition to the normal competitive dynamics in terms of gross to net, an important solution for patients actually out-of-pocket costs for - correct me, Mike, if I get this wrong, for patients in the U.S. dropped over the last three years from $34 to $21 per month on average for Lilly insulins. That is quite a bit lower than our competitors, but that does hit the price line for us, either through the now 70% off insulin lispro product, which is available or through the buydowns we do at the point of sale to $35 per month. So that is in the background. There is sort of a terminal quantity to that, but we have seen good adoption. And I guess the good news is patients are taking advantage of that and it is showing up and retaining volume, it does hit the net price line though. Okay. Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and of course, your interest in our Company. 2021 was an incredible year for the Company, as we produced strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients who rely on us. We entered 2022 with positive momentum and great focus on execution to deliver on the meaningful opportunities we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in today, and please follow up with our IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call. Have a good one. Take care."

        "speaker7": {
            "name": "Jacob Van Naarden",
            "content": "Yes, thanks for the question. So I think as it relates to the key barriers to adoption, I think the biggest one in the overlay, and then I will get more specific is just that this represents really the first new standard of care in this setting in 20 years. And so there are just a lot of physicians who have entrenched behavior and comfort with what they are doing. And so the first barrier is really around education and getting a comfort level changing behavior. And so that - we have a lot of tactics in place to do that to make sure that the data on the agent are known and to answer questions that physicians may have. More specifically, you highlighted a few things that are good things to know, which is the Ki-67 testing requirement and the interpretation of those results and integrating them into patient selection is a new thing for docs in this setting. As well as the diarrhea management, which is a real phenomenon with Verzenio. We have protocols in place that allow it to be managed and it tends to be a short-term short-term side effect that can be managed. But there are a lot of physicians out there who have literally never written a prescription of Verzenio because they have been historically large Ibrance users. And for that segment, in particular, there is an education component to get them comfortable and ensure they are using the protocols that we think work really well for diarrhea management. That all having been said, we are happy with what we are seeing so far, but it is early days, obviously, in this launch trajectory. Yes. So the first part of your question around the decision to file for mantle cell, you framed it as what is an unmet need versus regulatory feedback. And the answer really is both. So we have had a longitudinal conversation with the agency around this indication showing them our clinical data at various snapshots over time. And we got to a point where we had agreement on the key components of what an NDA could look like from a clinical package perspective. And so that informed our decision to file. In other words, this was not a sort of unilateral Lilly decision. This was done very much in concert with FDA. And I think they and us realized the unmet need of patients in the setting and the potential proposition of pirtobrutinib there. Obviously, the ultimate approval is subject to an FDA review. So nothing is done until it is done, of course. As it relates to the potential lag between a mantle cell approval and CLL approval, I think it is just too early to really comment because the latter, CLL is really subject to the enrollment dynamics of the Phase III program. And it is just a little too early days for us to really say exactly which one of those studies will be the first to read out and when, because it is so enrollment kinetics-contingent. So over the course of this year, we will have a lot more information about that, I presume and be in a better position to prognosticate about CLL timing. So the pirtobrutinib opportunity we see primarily and certainly initially is in patients who have been previously treated with a BTK inhibitor or more. Obviously, we think there is a potential for the drug in the first line, and that is why we are running studies there. We have two studies that we are running in first-line CLL. One is, as you mentioned, a head-to-head study against ibrutinib. The other, which will take a long time to read out because of the natural history of the control arm. The other is a study we just recently started against chemoimmunotherapy. That study will read out much, much quicker. And, therefore, allow for the drug to be labeled in the first-line setting. And I think what we have learned, particularly from other newer entrants in this space is that you really need to generate a differentiating data set in some way, shape or form, and then have the labeled indications that allow physicians and patients to have choice. And I think, in particular, the Calquence acalabrutinib program has shown that you really actually don't necessarily need direct head-to-head data to suggest differentiation or for at least physicians to perceive differentiation in different drugs, so long as you have a labeled indication that allows for on-label prescribing and reimbursement. So one of the reasons that we initiated the first-line chemo immunotherapy study was to have a path to that first-line label more quickly and allow patients and physicians to make choices. Thanks for the question on sintilimab. So as you know, we have the FDA Advisory Committee meeting with Invent a week from today. Our position on the matter really hasn't changed nor have our expectations. But we believe that the risk/benefit of the agent is demonstrable on the basis of the well-conducted study and we believe the results of the study are indeed applicable to a U.S. population. And we will make our case in that respect a week from today. That having been said, we understand the stance of the agency may have changed or maybe we may have misinterpreted it a few years ago. And so will await the FDA's presentation on that topic and the feedback from the ODAC members. But we think this product, if approved, could be meaningful for patients in the United States as a result of our disruptive pricing strategy. But we obviously don't know if we will be able to execute on that."

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time to do require assistance during the call, please press star then 0 and an operator will assist you offline. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nKevin Hearn: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2021 earnings call. Kevin Hearn, VP of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO, Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Dan Skowronski (ph), Chief Scientific and medical officer [indiscernible] White (ph) President of Lilly Neuroscience, Jake Van Arden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly and President of Lilly Oncology. Patrick Johnson (ph), President of Lilly immunology, and Lilly U.S.A. and Mike Mason (ph), President of Lilly Diabetes. We're also joined by Lauren Zerki Santueja and Sarah Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.  Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Q and 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I will turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our third quarter results.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Kevin. Once again, Lilly had a very strong quarter growing our newest medicines around the world and continuing to advance significant potential new medicines in the late-stage development. While also building long-term opportunities through early-stage investments in technology and progress in early-stage programs. Q3 2021 was also a period where the resilience of our Company, our people and collaborators were tested by the pandemic. And again, they rose to the challenge on, personally recognize and thank my Lilly teammates for delivering such a strong overall performance. Innovating to maintain pipeline velocity, running our plans to meet the rapidly growing demand of medicines and continuing to serve our customers, whether be in person or online. Turning to our strategic deliverables on slide 4, Q3 revenue grew 18% compared to Q3 2020, or 17% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was 17 percentage points. When excluding COVID-19 therapies, which includes revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew an estimated 11% for the quarter and year-to-date. Revenue attributable to our newer medicines grew over 35% and now represents nearly 60% of our core business this quarter, an important indicator for our long-term growth potential. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3 or 79.3%, excluding for the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, our gross margin decreased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, representing an improvement of over 400 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. And over 100 basis points of sequential improvement from Q2 of this year. We had a number of significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call in August.  Including the FDA approvals for Verzenio and certain people with high-risk early breast cancer. And for Jardiance and collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Regulatory submissions for Tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes in the U.S. to which we applied a priority review voucher, as well as the EU, and Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We initiated a rolling submission in the U.S. for donanemab in early Alzheimer's disease and had positive Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. We also continue to augment our pipeline with these development opportunities as we continue to leverage external innovation to build our discovery capabilities with a focus on new modalities at Lilly. In Q3, we announced a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Lycia Therapeutics to utilize their proprietary protein degradation technology. Finally on financials, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend this quarter. Moving to slides 5 and 6, you'll a see list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including issuing the company\u2019s first sustainability bond with proceeds allocated toward environmental projects, including pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, as well as social projects to increase access to essential services and social economic advancement and empowerment.  We announced a series of leadership and organizational changes this quarter. Recent positive data readouts this year led us to the natural decision to increase our focus on immunology and NeuroScience and to unify the Loxo Oncology and Lilly Oncology organizations. We believe these changes enhance our ability to execute on a broad range of exciting commercial and pipeline opportunities. I'd like to welcome Jake Van Arden, to Lilly's Executive Committee, and look forward to Ann, Patrick and Jake continuing their leadership in their new roles. They'll be focused on increasing our competitiveness in their therapeutic areas and growing our existing medicines while also launching our late-stage pipeline of new medicines which could benefit patients across a diverse set of medical conditions.  Similarly, I'm grateful for Ilias (ph) continued leadership and look forward to him leading our growing international business. Finally, I would like to thank [indiscernible] for his impact on our Company across more than three decades of his commitment to patients, to development of our industry-leading commercial capabilities and his relentless focus on execution and mentorship of countless Lilly leaders. Kudo (ph) thank you for your service to our Company. We have a deep leadership venture at Lilly. They're smart, they're energetic and experienced. And I know they're as excited as I am to take Lilly to another level in the decade ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q3 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2021.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the Third Quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 18% this quarter compared to Q3, 2020 or 11% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for core business, despite the impact of Alimta's OUS [indiscernible] We continue to be pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Paul's, Verzenio and Jardiance as our key growth products made up nearly 60% of our core business during the quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined ten basis points to 79% in Q3. Favorable products mix excluding COVID-19 therapies, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold were more than offset by lower gross margin on COVID-19 therapies. Total operating expenses grew eight percent this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased one percent while R and D expenses increased 17% driven by significant investments in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including the non [indiscernible], [indiscernible]and [indiscernible].  We also invested approximately $50 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q3, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately 350 million year-to-date. Operating income increased 37% compared to Q3 2020. And operating income as a percent of revenue was 30.5% for the quarter, an increase of 420 basis points compared to the prior year with sequential growth for second straight quarter. This increase was driven by revenue growth, outpace, and expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense were expense of $7 million for this quarter compared to income of 10 million in Q3 2020. Our effective tax rate was 14.3%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year.  The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2021 was driven by a mix of earnings and lower tax jurisdiction, partially offset by a decrease in net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2020. At the bottom line, we delivered strong growth as earnings per share increased 38% in Q3, 2021. On slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth, and we're encouraged by the growth seen across the world. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 26% compared to third quarter of 2020. Adjusting for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, revenue grew 14% in the US. This increase, driven largely by volume, was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, and Verzenio.  The higher net realized price in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Unfavorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Trulicity in the third quarter of 2020 and modest list price increases, partially offset by increased rebates to maintain broad patient access for our medicine. Our year-to - date U.S. net price decrease of 1% is in line with the low-to-mid single-digit guidance we gave last December, and our full-year outlook is consistent with those expectations.  Our 340B limited distribution program began September 2020, and so the fourth quarter of 2021 will be the first full quarter where its impact will also be including the base period when calculating year-over-year price changes in the U.S. Given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business. Moving to Europe, revenue grew 3% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the first full quarter of loss of exclusivity for Alimta. Revenue grew 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth, excluding Alimta.  In Japan, revenue decreased 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by the decline of post-patent products. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. Now, including Alimta as well as the by -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our key growth products grew 12% in Q3 in Japan. We expect improved revenue growth in Japan moving forward based on the uptake of these newer products. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency primarily driven by continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity. We're excited by the significant growth we're seeing in China with sales of new medicine continue to drive growth there.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effects on revenue for our September year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15 percentage point of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products.  In total, these brands generated nearly $3.9 billion in revenue this quarter, and made up 58% of our core business revenue. We are encouraged by the strength of our key growth products in Q3, collectively up over 35% compared to the same period in prior year. Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance all continued to outgrow their respective classes. and we're pleased with Taltz growth driven by increased access. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2021, we invested $7 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays, and capital investments. In addition, we returned over 2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and have repurchased $500 million in stock.  We will continue to fund the growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on slide 13, we're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We're increasing the full-year revenue outlook by 200 million at the top end of the range, and 400 million at the lower end of the range to reflect additional COVID-19 antibody revenue. And the outlook for a core business. COVID-19 antibody revenue expectations are roughly 1.3 billion based on the existing U.S. government purchasing agreements for additional doses of etesevimab in Q3 and Q4.  The net impact of these changes is an update revenue range of $27.2 billion to $27.6 billion, up from the previous range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. As we noted last quarter, investments in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches are expected to push us to the top end of our guidance range for operating expenses. Our reported and non-GAAP operating margin guidance is unchanged, Excluding the impact of COVID-19 antibodies, non-GAAP operating margin remains approximately 31%. Our non-GAAP ranges for other income and expense and our expected tax rate remains unchanged as well.  On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of 250 million -- 250 million, reflecting the impact of the charges associated with a repurchase of debt and net mark-to-market losses on investments in equity securities. In the Third Quarter of 2021, the 2021 effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 11% on a reported basis, reflecting the tax impact of the charges associated with the repurchase of debt and acquired IP R&D, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2021. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share has been raised to 795 to 805, while the GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.48. At our Investor's Day in December, we will share our initial 2022 guidance.  Today, before I turn the call over to Dan for the R&D update, I'd like to provide a few reminders on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as we begin thinking about the next year. In Q3, we saw the initial impact of Alimta's OUS patent expiry in Europe and Japan. Next year, we will see its full-year impact, as well as the U.S. patent expiry, with limited launches from a single generic Company in Q1 before the full launch of generic entrants starting in Q2. As for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, we intend to reflect in guidance our expectations related to signed purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies.  Currently we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 therapies in 2022 leading to more difficult year-over-year comparisons. As we do this year, we will provide commentary on our financials excluding the impact of revenue and certain expenses from COVID-19 therapies to enable more healthful year-over-year comparison of the performance of our core business [indiscernible] major use drugs price and reform, our 2022 and mid-term outlook continues to be mid-single-digit net price erosion in the U.S. and globally, is the impact of lower utilization of 340B segments moved into the base pace period as we enter Q4, 2021.  we continue to invest in our bright future as we advance promising R&D opportunities in scale up to support exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline. While these investments may pressure operating margin in the near term, they are critical to maximizing pipeline opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid to long-term. Now I will turn over the call to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. Like 2020 before it, 2021 continues to be a very productive year for R&D at Lilly. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll highlight several updates from our late-stage pipeline. Starting with Tirzepatide. We shared detailed results from tirzepatide SURPASS-4 Study at EASD this quarter. SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest surpass trial completed to-date. And we were encouraged by the continued hemoglobin A1C and weight control, which participants experienced even past the initial 52-week treatment period, and continuing up to 2 years. Looking at slide 14, this shows the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C over time during the study.  A1C reduction plateaued by roughly 24 weeks and was maintained at 52 weeks and thereafter, to 104 weeks across all the Tirzepatide doses. While in the insulin glargine comparator arm, A1C began to increase after 52 weeks. Durability of A1C control is a challenge for type 2 diabetes treatments. While the 104-week data isn't a definitive answer as to whether Tirzepatide could potentially offer even longer-term durable blood glucose control, these data certainly are encouraging. Moving to Slide 15, as you can see, weight loss plateaued at approximately 52 weeks and was maintained thereafter, such that at 2 years, weight difference at the highest dose was approximately 15% compared to insulin glargine.  We've seen in previous incretin therapy trials conducted with GLP-1 s a further increased impact on weight reduction in participants with obesity without type-2 diabetes compared to studies in participants who do have type two diabetes, such as this one. It will be interesting to see if this trend also extends to the dual agonism of Tirzepatide, which has demonstrated weight reductions in type two diabetes trials beyond what has been shown by GLP-1s to-date. We clearly are excited about the weight loss potential here and we believe the data to date bode well for upcoming readouts in obesity, starting with surmount one which reads out next-year. Tirzepatide represents a new class of medicines.  And we're focused on continuing our significant investment for patients with type two diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders who may benefit from Tirzepatide. Moving to slide 16, today we announced the U.S. submission for Tirzepatide and Type II diabetes, and that we used a priority review voucher with the intention of bringing this investigational treatment to patients as quickly as possible. We are delighted that the continued progress for this novel dual agonist incretin and hope to obtain approval in the U.S. by the middle of next year. Moving to donanemab, we have several important updates for this program. First, in the U.S., we initiated a rolling BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval in early Alzheimer's disease.  We intend to complete the submission in the next few months and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2022. We've also completed the original planned enrollment of 1,500 participants for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2. And based on the pre -specified 18-month primary endpoint, expect to have topline results by the middle of 2023. We've added a separate single arm addendum for safety exposures to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which has already enrolled more than 300 patients and is continuing to enroll rapidly. This addendum will provide us with additional safety data to support the rolling submission. Moving to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, this is a prevention study for cognitively unimpaired individuals who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have clinical symptoms. We're excited to report that we have already initiated screening.  This pioneering trial has multiple novel elements to reduce research subject burden, including the use of our phospho-tau217 blood assay currently in development to help detect Alzheimer's disease pathology in the patient screening process. Video call technology for assessing cognitive function in the subject's home, and a large network of infusion centers that allow subjects to select the site most convenient to them in a decentralized clinical trial paradigm. We also announced today our plans to conduct a head-to-head Phase 3 study comparing donanemab to Aducanumab to assess superiority of brain amyloid plaque clearance in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  The co-primary endpoints will evaluate complete amyloid plaque clearance as measured by [indiscernible] pure FAT and PET scan, and will assess superiority on bringing amyloid plaque clearance in the total population, and also the intermediate [indiscernible] population. This study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 is expected to begin enrollment this year. And we expect to share primary endpoint data in the second half of 2022. We're encouraged with the progress we've made with the [indiscernible] and with its potential to positively impact patients with high unmet medical need. We have of course, followed progress in the Alzheimer's disease landscape since our last call, and are watching closely as CMS 's national coverage determination process plays out. We're committed to facing the challenges of effectively communicating donanemab 's, clinical data, and value proposition and to ensuring that the diagnostic and patient management ecosystems are adequately well - prepared. Given the current environment, we think it's reasonable to have modest expectations for the scale of patient impact for anti-amyloid therapies available under accelerated approval prior to the readout of their definitive Phase III data. Assuming potential accelerated approval for donanemab in the second half of 2022, are expected TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 phase three readout by mid-2023 would follow quickly, meaning the window of accelerated approval without definitive Phase II data is likely to be brief. Assuming positive Phase three results, we should be confident in the mid and long-term opportunity for donanemab if approved. Moving on to Verzenio. In-line with the expectations I outlined last quarter, we were pleased with Verzenio 's recent FDA approval as the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, for adult patients with HR-positive, HER2 -negative, node-positive early breast cancer, who are at high risk of recurrence with the Ki-67 index of greater than equal to 20% as detected by an FDA-approved test. This approval in the Adjuvan setting represents the first new addition to endocrine therapy and Adjuvan treatment of HR-positive QAR2 -negative breast cancer in nearly two decades.  We're delighted to bring this important new treatment option to patients. Also, we recently shared updated data from the entire monarchE study at the ESMO Virtual Plenary meeting and co-published these data in Annals of Oncology. These data, which reflect additional follow-ups since our last public presentation, highlight the robustness and the effect size we're seeing for Verzenio in the Adjuvan setting. Notably, with a median follow-up of 27 months, we are pleased to see both IDFS and DRFS benefit extend beyond the two-year study treatment period. These data are not only important for patients, but also to help dispel concerns that the curves would come back together over time.  We're clearly observing -- we've clearly observed continued separation of the curves, if not expanding separation. Since the Adjuvan approval two weeks ago, there's been questions regarding why the FDA approval applied only to a subset of the study population. As previously communicated, overall survival was a secondary outcome measure for the monarchy study. And an important component of the FDA's review. But we do not typically publish immature overall survival data, we feel it's valuable to address these important questions about the difference between the enrolled study population and the approved indication. As a result, while the overall survival data remain immature, we do plan to publish the [indiscernible] data from the additional follow-up analysis, with cut-off of April 1, 2021, in a medical journal in the coming days.  These data will show what we have observed thus far for overall survival trends in the ITT population compared to the approved population. We'll continue to follow patients in the ITT population for more mature overall survival data. If positive OS trend emerges in the ITT population, we plan to work with regulators to expand our Adjuvan indication. Importantly, the collective results from Verzenio clinical development program have demonstrated a differentiated CDK4/6 inhibitor profile. And we look forward to continued investment in Verzenio for breast and prostate cancer and are excited about the opportunity to serve more patients.  Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. They've been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In oncology, in addition to the exciting news for Verzenio, we continue our investment in Pirtobrutinib Phase III program with an additional study starting chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including fixed duration Pirtobrutinib plus Venetoclax and rituximab in relapsed or refractory patients. We plan to start a study in first-line treatment compared to bendamustine plus rituximab before year-end. We prioritize this first-line study rather than the head-to-head study evaluating superiority compared to brutinib as we think this first-line study could provide a faster pathway to bring Pirtobrutinib to patients in the first-line setting.  We expect the head-to-head brutinib CLL study to start in the first half of 2022. We look forward to sharing updated dataset from the Phase 1-2 BRUIN study at a medical meeting later this year, we plan to provide a regulatory update for Pirtobrutinib at our Investor Day in December. [inaudible 00:28:55] our oral [indiscernible], also moved into Phase 3, with the start of its monotherapy study compared to Exemestane or fulvestrant's. Finally, we also publicly identified and presented preclinical characterization for two new agents at the Molecular Targets meeting this month. LOXO 783, which is a highly mutant selective allosteric PI3K alpha inhibitor, and LOXO 435 which is a highly isoform -selective FGFR3 inhibitor.  We look forward to filing IND for both programs in 2022 and subsequently moving them into the clinic. In Diabetes, In addition to the Tirzepatide update, we obtained U.S. approval for Jardiance and HFpEF, presented detailed results from the emperor preserved study at the European Society of Cardiology and submitted for HFpEF in the US and Europe. We're excited about the opportunity Jardiance has to improve outcomes for patients across type II diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. We also started Phase II studies for our GLP-1 non-peptide agonist in collaboration with Chugai in type II diabetes and In obesity, and look forward to sharing some Phase I data from this molecule in December.  In immunology, we were delighted to have multiple positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to the readout of the maintenance data from the ADvocate 1 and 2 studies in the first half of next year, ahead of global submissions expected by the end of 2022. We're pleased with our progress in immunology this year with positive Phase 3 readouts for mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, and look forward to sharing more about our next-generation of early phase immunology assets in December. In neurodegeneration, our anti-tau antibodies Zachatenamab recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's. Zachatenamab failed to meet the primary endpoint and was unable to modulate tau spread in the brain. The placebo population progressed as expected.  While this negative outcome was disappointing. And we're discontinuing development for Zachatenamab, we remain committed to Tao as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease, and plan to continue studying Tao biology, including inhibition of tau aggregation with a small-molecule OGA inhibitor currently in the clinic. In the pain therapeutic area, in collaboration with Pfizer, we discontinued the global clinical development program for tanezumab, following receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain and a negative opinion adopted by the CHMP.  And finally, the FDA expanded the emergency use authorization for Bamlanivimab and Aducanumab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To recap, Q3 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, continuing the positive momentum we've seen with a steady stream of significant pipeline advancements over the last couple of years. As we move closer towards our goal of delivering more faster best-in-class treatment options to patients in areas of unmet need. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks : Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during the quarter. We have seen continued strength in our core business through the first 9 months of the year, with double-digit volume-driven revenue growth net of COVID-19 therapies and strong performance across key brands. We're pleased to see sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansions, as well as strong non-GAAP earnings growth. We have made significant progress developing new medicines. And Q3 was another important quarter for our pipeline as we announced the submission of Tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, the initiation of a rolling submission for donanemab in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease, key life cycle approvals, and submissions for Verzenio and Jardiance, and positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab.We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends in Q3, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we move toward the close of 2021, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. While the past year has seen tremendous advances in our late-stage pipeline, at our Investor Day in December, we look forward to sharing information with you regarding the next generation of assets that we believe will enable us to sustain the flow of innovative medicines to patients and augment our future growth prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Louise, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then were ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Chris Schott, please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks so much for the questions. I guess the first one for me is just on some of the 2022 comments. know you're not giving formal guidance yet, but should we be thinking about margin expansion next year from the roughly 30% or so margins that are implied in this year's guidance? I'm just trying to get my hands around how meaningful of a step-up an OpEx we should be thinking about supporting new, these major new launches coming next year. And the second one was just one related to bibs rollout of aduhelm, it's obviously been a challenging launch.  Are there learnings here or just changes about how you're thinking about your go-to-market strategy for donanemab and I know Dan, you made some comments in the remarks, but should we be thinking about much in the way of revenue at all for donanemab. And I guess in that window between when it's approved and prior to Trailblazer, too, I'm sure a sense of again, just as you look at what's happened, there is there been surprises or changes in your thinking on the market. Thanks so much.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks. Chris we'll go to Anat for the first question on 2022 margin expansion and then the on the thoughts about the uptake and outlook for donanemab.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Great. Thanks. So for 2022, we will provide further details and guidance in a couple -- in December, so not too far from now, and we'll provide additional carry on how we view the year and what investments and pushes and pulls we have going into next year. As you think about our margin expansion and the goals we've set out and we've communicated in terms of getting to mid-to-high 30s, in terms of margin expansion, we still have a clear line of sight to get there, and that's still our goal.  There will be -- but it's not a linear growth, so there will be years that are going to be stronger years, or we're going to be making specific targeted investments. And as you've seen us do this year with donanemab when we have strong convictions in the pipeline asset or when we're preparing to launch very promising opportunities and products, we will invest behind them. So think about this as still growing to mid-to-high 30s, but not necessarily in a linear fashion, but in line with investments we would need to make.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks Anat. Ann.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Well, as Dan stated and as our competitor has shared, they've experienced there clearly is work to do to ensure that the diagnostic and the patient ecosystems are prepared for these medicines. And until there is definitive phase three data, we do believe that we should really expect modest use of these medicine. Now fortunately, as Dan said, for donanemab, this confirmatory data comes quickly in mid-23 for travelers are all too. And so this will be the opportunity to really help patients on a more significant scale. Now, some of the opportunities here, certainly pursuing accelerated approval is really important, both to provide early access. but also to let us begin addressing some of these infrastructure challenges ahead of the Phase three data. We need to build out the diagnostic ecosystem, particularly PET scans and blood tests. We need to make sure that there's adequate infusion capacity. And then very importantly, we need to ensure that there's reimbursements so that the appropriate patients can have access to donanemab. So these are going to be our areas of focus now through our phase 3 window. We're confident in our ability to address these infrastructure challenges over time. And I would say by clearing plaque faster and deeper, we believe that as well as identifying the right patients, we've optimized the chances for showing compelling benefits in the Phase III, which is we said is what was going to show significant uptake in the class. We continue to see the same opportunity for donanemab in the mid to long term once these challenges are addressed and the confirmatory data is available.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks Ann.Chris Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Jeff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meacham: Hey guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. I had two on Alzheimer's probably for Dan. For donanemab, would you expect completion of the rolling submission by the end of this year, and is there a regulatory threshold you need to hit in terms of the safety exposure, I'm just trying to think of the number of patients that you have to get exposed to it and then for Zachatenamab, what are the next steps here? Is it moving to another anti-tau asset altogether, or do you want to optimize monotherapy Zachatenamab, or maybe even move forward in combination with donanemab? Thank you.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Jeff. Dan.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Great. Thanks, Jeff for two good questions. The first is just on the timing of the completion of the donanemab rolling submission. I think you can assume we chose our words carefully here in the call prepared remarks on the timing, you're driving out like what's the regulatory hurdle with respect to safety exposures. You're right, that's the key gating factor on timing. You've heard we've enrolled a lot of patients in the clinical trials, including patients in safety addendum. So, we're extremely confident we'll reach that safety exposure hurdle.  I guess, looking forward, there's probably two risks or question marks. One is just around the timing of exactly when do databases get locked and data get cleaned and submitted to the FDA. So that's why we're a little vague on timing here. I think the second one of course that we don't know and won't know until all that data is in, is what are the safety that actually show. And so the assumption here, of course, is that they continue to be consistent with what we've seen in Phase 2. So if those things work out, then I think that'll be the opportunity to talk a little more specifically about the data.  With respect to zagotenemab, look, I think we have here a very potent anti-tau antibody designed against what we believe is an important species of aggregated tau delivered at a relatively high doses for any monoclonal antibody, and we were unable to slow the spread of tau progression in the brain. So as present, I don't see a path forward for this antibody and I would be reluctant to invest in really any anti -tau antibody, given what we've seen here, Tau is still a great target, it's just hard to hit it with a monoclonal antibody, I think, given that most of the tau that we care about is inside of cells.\nJeff Meacham: Thank you.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dan. Jeff, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: And then next caller is Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my questions here. So my first question is, how are you preparing for the launch of Donanemab and Tirzepatide next year. And how should we think about the costs associated with that launch? And then 2nd question I had for you is, do you think it's the national coverage determination or the price of Aduhelm that is keeping doctors on the sidelines? Thanks.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks. We'll go to Anat for the question on launch prep and the overall costs for both tirzepatide in donanemab how we think about that going into next year. And then we'll go to Ian for the question around the NCD and ADG home.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Sure. So as we're preparing to launch both these medicines, obvious 1 is in an area where we have significant commercial footprint, manufacturing scale up capabilities and the other 1 is an area we're currently building. So, we're investing in advancing both of these efforts forward preparing for potential launch of Tirzepatide mid next year, and then a regulatory decision on donanemab by the second half of next year. Those will be factored into the guidance that we will provide on December 15th as we go into -- as we go into next year. But rest assured we're building the commercial footprint that we needed to launch these effectively and leveraging the existing footprint we have as well.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks Anat. Ann?\nAnne: Well, it's a good question that you've asked and I -- I do think there's a number of things that are challenged here. I think as you look at donanemab what's incredibly important is that we had a positive phase 2 study that cleanly met its primary endpoint, showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, as well we're able to share that we had limited duration dosing to plaque clearance and so we believe that this is going to be important for the decisions that physicians and payers make. So I believe the donanemab data is incredibly strong. And then as I said, following quickly the Phase 3 confirmatory data, which I think is important, and all of this being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So as we're talking to thought leaders and physicians, I do believe that they see the strength of the data that we brought forward in donanemab, and I think that's been a challenge that they've had with some of the competitive space. So I do think that data is one thing on their minds. I think it's well the NCD is playing a role, obviously that will be resolved before we launch and that will be ready for any of the potential out comes there. And I have been working closely with them along the way to make sure that they understand the donanemab data, particularly the rapid clearing of plaques as well as the limited duration dosing that offers we think benefit to them as well. So, it's been a good conversation with them. So far, we really look forward to seeing what they have to say CMS has the same in January and then launching with the strong datasets as Dan said in the second half of next year.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dan. Lousie, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTim Anderson : Hi. Thank you. I have a couple of questions on the pending in CD by CMS. So 2 questions. First, it's commonly said that this upcoming decision will pertain to the whole ABA class. I struggle to see how that can realistically be the case, because that decision will be made on only 1 Company's mixed Phase 3 data, and there's still other really important informative Phase 3 datasets that are on the come. So wouldn't be NCD, whatever it is initially potentially be revised later as CMS has more information from these additional trials. And then second, if this is indeed a decision that pertains to the whole class, and presumably Lilly has a view on what will happen in January. Do you expect CMS will say that Aduhelm and the class more broadly should be covered in a way that will be commercially meaningful. One can envision that there could be lots of restrictions that might impact to limit the commercial market opportunities.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Sam, we'll go to Ann for those questions on the NCD process.\nAnne: Well, thanks. Good questions on the process for the NCD. So CMS has been clear that the NCD, as they are running the process is to cover the class. Now as I said, we are actively participating in the process, including we provided oral comments in July. And additional written comments in August, and we and I'm sure others as well have been meeting with CMS throughout the process to share our specific data and ensure that the differences in these medicines are understood. And so we've asked them really to evaluate each drug based on their own data. And this is, I think, as I said, particularly important considering that there are some differences between these. We share the data later in the air subsequent to the original readout that the degree of donanemab plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit which I know is very important to CMS in this decision as well as the limited duration dosing. So we really look forward to seeing what they have to say in January, and what readout will look like. We do acknowledge there's a lot of skepticism in the national discussion. And so we do really hope and we'll continue to influence that we think it's drugs should be evaluated by CMS, by payers and prescribers on their own data. It is possible that NCD, the NCD will narrow for the patients most likely the benefit that's a possibility out of this. But that's really aligned with the goals that we've had on our clinical trial designs, which has long been to use the diagnostic tools to make sure that the right patients are getting treatment. So we'll look forward to the readout in January. We'll continue to stay very engaged in this. And yes, I believe as additional data comes out, our data and others in the class, that this will continue to influence the process.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, An. Tim, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: The noise coming out of Washington suggests that the Peter's Bill, some of the components of that are gaining traction on some of them are worrying components of price negotiations seem to be more and more limited. I just wonder if you could share any thoughts on what you think, just take the Peter's proposal on out-of-pocket carbs could mean to Lilly and the farmer in terms of increased volume without catastrophic coverage changes. And then second, could you comment on whether you're seeing mutualization of donanemab by the antibody drug antibodies that you see with prolonged usage. And is this one of the factors which is contributing to the finite treatment duration or is neutralization simply not a concern here?\nKevin Hearn: Thanks Andrew and Dave for the first question and Dan for the second.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Obviously, there's a lot of talking and discussing going on in Washington about how to Mig medicines more affordable. I think we've been pretty consistent in our view that both as Lilly and I think I can speak for the industry here we are for progress. We're not for the status quo and the centerpiece of almost every part of legislation being discussed which is I think good news for seniors is some reform to the Part D benefit. That is certainly highlighted in representative Peter's Bill. It's in HR-19, it was in the aggressive widen effort. It's I'm sure in the Senate Finance effort now, and I think that's good news. The contours of that are all kind of different, but the general idea is that industry would pay additional costs into the system, that that would reduce monthly out-of-pocket costs, both below and above the catastrophic phase cap -- catastrophic costs as well as eliminate the donut hole.  I think we're basically for all those things and we think that's a good set of initiatives. Where the debate sort of kicks in is around how to pay for that, or whether pay for from the industry should go to other healthcare priorities. And of course, we have clear positions on that. One piece of Peter's Bill we don't like is the retroactive CPI Cap. I think that's punitive and unfair. It also is disproportionate on some types of medicines versus others. So I think the industry is aligned, [indiscernible] we don't care for that. Although in general, the idea of a CPI regulator on forward price increases is something people have gotten used to talking about.  And then the thing we do, put our foot down and firmly opposed and why we're so against HR3 and other efforts, is taking money out of the pharmaceutical industry for other priorities. Isn't drug pricing a big enough problem? Why don't we take the money out of pharmaceutical industry and give it to patients who want to buy our medicines. And that's a position we've had for a long time. I think it's been a busy week and into next week, probably negotiating out this package, but we're hopeful that some of these messages are resonating and we could land with a Part D reform and modest impact on the industry so we can keep innovating for the future.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dave, Dan.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks Andrew for the question on anti-drug antibodies or ADA's. We do see ADA's with donanemab, they arise pretty early in treatment. There's no connection though with the ADA and our decision on fixed duration dosing. The reason for that is because the doses that we're using are so much higher than the level of anti-drug antibodies that we don't see an effect in our clinical trials that these doses of the ADA's on PK or importantly on PD, which is the plaque clearance effect of donanemab, so no connection there.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dan. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim Securities, please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez : Thanks for the questions. So maybe first on the performance of Verzenio in the quarter and then your conviction that this market can accelerate moving forward now with the Ki-67 approval. We're hearing good things from physicians, but it just doesn't seem to be reflected in the opportunity that I think we all see ahead for Verzenio. And then as a separate question, I'm sure Mike Mason is tracking the opportunity in obesity very closely. Just wondering what feedback is on the types of patients that are going on to [indiscernible] at this point and how Lilly is thinking about the opportunity in obesity, given the attempted acceleration of the launch of Tirzepatide with the PRB. And obviously, that's in diabetes. but just wondering when we might see a full launch in obesity, given all the trials. Thanks.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Jake for the question on Verzenio and then Mike for the question on Tirzepatide.\nJake Van Arden: Thanks, Seamus. So just starting with Verzenio performance in the quarter. As you probably remember, we had some stocking that happened in the channel in the second quarter, and so part of what happened this quarter is just a modest work down of that inventory. I think the fundamentals of where we stand in the metastatic setting continue to look really strong. I like where we are in terms of NBRX share hopping around 30% hopefully we can continue to grow that. I think that we still haven't seen the entire class of CDK46 inhibitors returns of pre - COVID levels of prescriptions. And so that's obviously an important lever for growth going forward. Probably levered to things like mammogram volumes and other types of preventative care measures that get patients diagnosed and into doctor's offices. But we continue to grow our share of NBRX within the market. Turning to Adjuvan, obviously, we're very excited about launching this medicine for men and women with early breast cancer specifically Ki-67 high patients. It's a real opportunity as I think you've probably heard say before. It's about 8,000-10,000 patients. It's obviously a smaller opportunity than the entire study population that we enrolled in monarchy. And as you know, we'll be looking -- again, next year will be the next analysis of survival to potentially expand to that broader population, should OS trend in the direction that we and FDA want to see to do that. But we have a great opportunity ahead of us. I think certainly it's growth from where we stand today. It's a brand-new indication of real size in terms of both patient numbers and duration. In many ways, that -- realizing that is also linked to the prior comments I made about patients returning to the doctor for preventative care to get diagnosed at levels, hopefully that return to pre -COVID. We don't need that obviously to make headway going into next year, but I think for the long term, it's important for patients to make sure they get into the physician's office to get diagnosed.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Jake, Mike.\nMike B Mason: Hi, Seamus. First of all, you are 100% right. We're looking very closely at the obesity opportunity for Tirzepatide. We're very excited about the weight loss that we solve in type 2 diabetes patients, of up to 14% weight loss, and the potential of that being even higher in the obesity population. Obviously, just a massive unmet need 110 million Americans live with obesity. Only about 3% of them are treated with some type of anti-obesity medication. So we think the opportunity is huge to really help people who live with chronic weight management issues. Now, with our program, we have four trials in us surmount obesity registration program.  Our first obesity trial will read out next year or SURMOUNT-1 We're very excited to see that that should happen in mid next year. And then, SURMOUNT-1 2, 3, and 4, we'll get the day of those trials are on track to wrap up in 23. And then so when you look at our obesity submission and approval, it looks like our approval in 2024 is most likely outcome. If everything goes well as we expect in our SURMOUNT program. So very excited about -- with all these launches. I think they've done a nice job. I think not a surprise to us. We thought that what was holding back the current market was just the current products in the marketplace just didn't have clinically meaningful enough weight loss.  We thought if we had products on the marketplace that had clinically meaningful weight loss and those products were able to show good, clinical outcomes, overall medical outcomes for those living with obesity, that position for [inaudible 00:56:27] and payers would provide access for it. So it's not going to develop overnight, but we're very encouraged by the early launch and we go big, and just very excited about Tirzepatide 's opportunity.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Mike, Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore, please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Dan, I was very intrigued by the donanemab versus Aducanumab head-to-head trial. And my question really was I understand the primary endpoints on amyloid plaque. But will the trial be able to gauge clinical efficacy on endpoints like CDR, some of the boxes. I ask because it's -- my understanding it's an open-label trial. And then secondly, I feel like there's been a fair amount of investor debate and perhaps confusion on what exactly is Lilly messaging on the Innovent PD-1 launch in U.S. And the sort of debate rages anywhere from Lilly will be a dominant player or not so much. So just so we're all on the same page, I guess, what are you guys expecting and do you expect it to be a meaningful PD-1 in the U.S. market? And if you could speak to your thoughts on whether data generated in Chinese patients would be a relevant commercial consideration for U.S. oncologists are not?\nKevin Hearn: Thanks Umer. We go to Dan for the first question and Jake for the second.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks. Our question is whether the Nan members that it can amount trial head-to-head trial, will be powered to measure clinical efficacy outcomes. It will not be. It is a small and a shorter trial. So we won't be able to draw conclusions about that. But I'd point out that if we believe that plaque Luring is the appropriate surrogate and that question will certainly be answered in the next year to 18 months as we get data from a number of Phase three plaque-lowering drugs, so if it turns out that plaque lowering is an appropriate surrogate for predicting clinical efficacy, then I think that the degree and speed of plaque lowering could be the basis of comparison across different Alzheimer's drugs in the same way that surrogates in oncology to used to compare different drugs in a class, knowing that the long-term outcome trials would have to be extremely large and long duration, powered for clinical outcomes. I also sort of point out that we we're expecting here to have in the scenario where we're really excited about this, we're expecting to have a positive Phase 3 trial for donanemab, which in itself is a differentiator, I think from current competitors. So head-to-head on efficacy against Adjuvan may not actually be relevant.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dan. Jake.\nJake Van Arden: Hey, Umer, thanks for the question. So Sintilimab, the PD-1 inhibitor from Innovent, we brought in to the Company in terms of ex-China right explicitly with the intent to use pricing as a lever to disrupt the U.S. market starting with the United States and potentially moving to Europe as well. And as we've said publicly over the past couple of months, the intent there is really through price predominantly versus other mechanisms such as rebating etc. There are certain customers out there, certain practices, and care models for which this is going to be an attractive tool for lowering costs to their system. And Unfortunately for the way the system is designed today, they are going to be many channels for which a lower-priced option actually isn't appealing. And so as you -- your question was about whether or not we intend to be a dominant player? It's hard for me to say that with any degree of assertion today. We will be focusing, initially, on the segments for which this is an attractive option, given the way that their payer dynamics work. And today that's not a majority by any stretch, but that will be our focus out of the [indiscernible] should [inaudible 01:00:27] be approved. Onto your second question about whether or not the data package that's been generated for the agent will have issues with prescribers in the United States. Our market research today suggests this won't be an issue.  But obviously we haven't launched the product yet, we haven't gotten it approved yet, so I can't say that with certainty that our market research suggests it won't be an issue. But really in front of us initially is just getting the drug approved, and I think as you know, that's something we hope for in the early part of next year. But the drug will be subject to an advisory committee and we await the details of what that will cover.\nUmer Raffat: Super helpful. Thank you so much.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Jake. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nRonny Gal : Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Two of those, first thing with Umar's points around Sintilimab in the U.S. Essentially two parts on this one. First, any comments about FDA change in policy and use in China only patient population as basis of Commission, the United States, we've heard some things and conferences that suggest that might be some change there. And second, on the same point, you've kind of talked about price as the dominant note here. I guess the question is more around you thinking process You know, pharma has struggled for a long time in commercializing low-cost products and innovative products to the same Company. If PD1 should have a low-cost option, why not pulp why not lebrikizumab why should those not follow a deep discounting strategy giving the clinical profile versus other products in the same class. And 2nd question, given the recent impact of interchangeable Lantus, can you discuss a little bit how the insulin their fast-acting insulin market is different, assuming we will see interchangeable products there, how are the features of the market differ? And would that also be a market which is more amenable to adopting any interchangeable insulin?\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dave for the 1st couple of questions around low - cost entrants and FDA policy, and then we'll go to Mike for the question on the interchangeability of Lantus and how that can potentially [inaudible 01:02:41] a fast-acting insulin.\nDavid Ricks : Sure. Happy to. Maybe before we go to me, Jake do you have any comments on the FDA comments on China data?\nJake Van Arden: Yeah. I think it's a good observation. We've observed the same thing. The tone from DC does seem to have changed a bit over the past 18 months on this topic. So I think we're hearing and reading in some ways, probably the same things that you guys are. We don't have a lot more information than that. And so we await again the regulatory decision from FDA as to the acceptability of the package.\nDavid Ricks : As it relates, Ronny, to the broader question about why not more everyday low-priced strategies in the main and pharmaceuticals. I mean, I think a couple of things come to mind here. First, I think in oncology in particular, it is infeasible quite often to run comparative studies. And so once an incumbent is established, it's very difficult to displace that incumbent. Maybe the one narrow exception might be what Jake highlighted with Sintilimab where you could have a more price-sensitive segment. And here we have analogous data from a different country that was conducted in a time-gap that was prior to other PD-1s being approved in that setting. And so that presents an opportunistic play.  We have of course also pursued this in insulin and Mike can comment on that in a second. But basically, our launch to the 30% discount to the other insulin glargine. We've pursued our own low-cost authorized generic of Humalog, now reducing the price to effectively 70% off the original brand. But here again, it illustrates the point Jake was making is that even in the retail side, it's not universally adopted. Today the half-price form of Humalog and the third off-price of insulin glargine that we provide have minority market shares and that's a little bit counter-intuitive. But of course, we all know the incentives of the supply chain which do tend to favor higher list price products, and that's I think where that shows up. Finally, you asked why don't we pursue this for our whole portfolio?  Well, I think the overriding thought for our portfolio was often to create differentiated datasets. And 1 thing different from [indiscernible] different from [indiscernible] and authorize generic, Humalog is that those aren't differentiated datasets. So they're more or less interchangeable. So when we create a new medicine, we're seeking to create something better. And in the main, that's how the system is set up and that favors typically an introductory price that's similar to other innovative competitors and then rebating and discounting to the channel to get formulary access and use. And that remains our main strategy.  Of course, if there were some big policy shifts that flattened gross to net or reduced, somehow, the incentives of intermediaries, we'd take a look at that. I think our goal would be to deliver lower cost points to consumers if we could. Right now, mostly the system rewards something else and that's how we are forward planning for the portfolio that Dan was talking about. Maybe Mike has any final comments on insulin and interchangeability.\nMike B Mason: Yeah. Thanks, Dave. First of all, when we look at Semglee, it's only interchangeable with the reference product, which is Lantus, not Basaglar, so we do think it's going to have a more of an impact on Lantus versus Basaglar. I mean, you look at the mill time segments, that first reference product will be insulin aspart, not LifePro (PH). Now I think you also have to take a look at the assemblies interchangeable biosimilar.  I think many stakeholders in Washington believe that Semglee interchangeable insulin would launch at a significant discounted price. Now, that hasn't been the case. The net impact of assembly\u2019s interchange will launch is actually the introduction of a higher-priced presentation, not a lower-price presentation. The new presentation is priced at $269 a vial versus $99 a vial of the original singly, which is a 273% increase. So I think what you're not going to see, at least what we haven't seen in the insulin biosimilar space is that the Semglee interchangeable will we're really disrupt the basal insulin market.  Rather, what we'll do is allow it to compete and kind of their traditional healthcare system that we know have gaps which we talked about earlier and which we've been trying to fill with our insulin value program and the senior savings model. When you look at in kind of pivot to the mealtime insulin market, mealtime insulin is a bit more complicated. They require more presentations than what you see with a basal insulin. So, premixes are human insulin are also included on the contract. So I think the mealtime insulin is a little bit different than what you see on the basal insulin.  But what we've seen to-date is that given [indiscernible] and our price point on interchangeability, we don't think it's going to be really disruptive to the system, but more work within the current system, which we feel that we can strongly defend. At the end of day, I think, to reiterate Dave 's point, I think it's better when we're focused on improvements. and with our Connected Care launch with BIF, with our weekly basal insulin, I think we're focused on really driving innovation and better patient outcomes.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Mike. Ronny, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nKerry Holford: Hi. Thank you. 2 questions [inaudible 01:08:42] price. The increase in demand this quarter. Was that [indiscernible][inaudible 01:08:53] When you [indiscernible] higher [indiscernible] So [indiscernible] just talk a bit more about the dynamics [indiscernible] [indiscernible] in any way the upcoming Adjuvan launch. Then secondly, on the Adjuvan Situation [indiscernible] has commented on that call earlier today that the the FDA has stated into them, to mentioned the base with an idea [indiscernible] will be sufficient as long as in their debt effect on the risk making a bad thing to your experience. There be more relaxed approach in the FDA. [indiscernible] I'm just curious as to why you think there might be anything that you can give there. Thank you.\nDavid Ricks : Kerry, you were kind of breaking in and out, but I think these are for Jake. And the 1st question, Jake, if you didn't catch it, was about quarter-on-quarter revenue And whether that was affected by pricing in CDK46th market or rather the stocking point you made earlier. And then I think the 2nd point was about IDFS versus OS in the FDA 's policy [indiscernible] that.\nJake Van Arden: Yes. Thanks. On the 1st point, yes. I mean, the sequential quarters are really mostly related to the inventory stocking and destocking point that I made earlier. We haven't seen a ton of fluctuation in price. On your comment about Adjuvan, I can't comment on the back and forth that Novartis had with FDA, just obviously not privy to that. Though from what you -- the framing of your question, that actually doesn't sound particularly different than the conversation that we've had with the agency. As Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've of course, as you can imagine, gotten a fair number of questions from folks around the nature of the approval in the subgroup versus the enrolled population among RD.  And we'll be publishing in the coming days, the actual OS overall survival data that were part of the regulatory submission. You'll see what those trends look like in both the intent-to-treat population as well as the approved subset. And again, trends in one direction or another that you'll be able to interpret for yourself. But I don't -- from what I can hear, I don't think the Novartis feedback from the agency is all that different from what we've received.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Jake. Carrie (ph), thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities, please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a couple of other topics discussed as much. So one on Emgality. It feels like the CGR P markets has been impacted by COVID more than some others. Maybe you could just sort of give us a sense of the dynamics you're seeing there. And have you seen any impact from the oral CGRPs that have entered or preventing. Is that at any role on Emgality or on the class in the last few months? And then the second one just on the Jake side, obviously, a lot of focus on the FDA, their updates on that space. I'm curious if you have any updated timing around when you expect a new, final updated label for Olumiant in RA and/or a decision on the atopic dermatitis applications. Thank you.\nKevin Hearn: We'll go to answer the question on Emgality and Patrick for the question on Olumiant.\nAnne: Great. Well, thanks for the question on Emgality. So at present, what we've seen is the total migraine prescription market has seen growth but it's driven primarily by the total acute new patient starts and additional concomitant use. With the injectable class, I do think that we're still experiencing headwinds from the pandemic and increased competition in the prevention space overall. We do see some variability of this across the markets, some OUS markets are returning really to pre - COVID growth levels. And while we've seen improvement in the volume of new patient starts, the CGRP MAB class in the U.S. is still about 13% below where we were with the start of the pandemic. So with the new competition and then appropriate treatment for acute and prevention, we're seeing that the market should continue to grow as patient's reengage in the system.  On your question on oral impact, I think it's still a bit early to -- early days in the launches to see how this has impacted the space in this way. So we'll watch that carefully. I think our belief is that with so many patients and so much unmet need, the opportunity for these medicines, particularly the MAB,remains significance. And obviously in the end it comes down to what's best for that patient and how we get them to their migraine-free days. And that's one place that we think we believe [indiscernible] has an advantage. So, we'll continue to watch this space. We continue to believe in the efficacy that [indiscernible]brings to the market. And so, you'll see us continue to push forward in supporting the product.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, An. Patrick?\nPatrick Johnson: Well, thank you very much. In terms of the question related to rheumatoid arthritis, the FDA has requested changes to the box warning for all JAK inhibitors to include serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and deaths. And we believe in life about its most likely that the JAKs will be placed off of the biologic source of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. And that's Mediamath Olumiant is currently played in the U.S. so we don't see any major impact on Olumiant driven by this change. When we moved our atopic dermatitis, we know about the FDA meets their PDUFA due to the ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. And we believe also here, it's most likely above the JAK inhibitors, will end up being placed off to the biologics. Despite that, we also recognize that atopic dermatitis is a very heterogeneous disease. And our clinicians have a use for more tools in the toolbox, but that's what we believe is most likely moving forward. And we would expect some regulatory actions prior to the end of this year.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Patrick, Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first for Dan, just coming back to the head-to-head study. I don't think I've heard you say yet the time period in which you going to be measuring these reductions in amyloid. I believe you did give up second half, '22 a timeline for reading out the result. But, should we be thinking about that as like a three-month or six-month time point or just the number of patients that get to below the lower limit of detection over some period. And then maybe for Jake, on the third class, I know you guys have expressed some cautiousness on the role of [indiscernible] -- in the treatment paradigm in the past, we started to see some of the later stage data roll out from some of your competitors. Wanted to get your latest thoughts there. And if we might start to see some of your third combination data from the original EMBER study before year-end. Thank you.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Carter. We'll go to Dan to the 1st question on the Aducanumab head-to-head and then Jake for the 2nd.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks for your question, Carter. I think you're appropriately pointing out that actually both things matter in terms of plaque clearance, how fast you clear the plaques, and also how deep you clear the plaques. I think in the fullness of time when we have Phase 3 readouts for multiple drugs that look at efficacy, I predict those would be 2 important predictor factors and how well a drug helps patients is, how quickly and how deeply it clears plaques. I think we have significant [indiscernible] there in both aspects with donanemab. So you can be sure we'll be looking at both of those things and reporting that out as I said in the back-half of next year.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Dan. Jake.\nJake Van Arden: Yeah. Thanks for the questions about their old cert program. We're looking forward to seeing the radius Menarini data at San Antonio as I'm sure you are. That's studies. are a little interesting and that is very heavily enriched for ESR-1 mutated tumors. And so, we're interested in seeing the degree to which the effect size observed in the study was really driven by that enriched subgroup where you would expect an outsized effect size versus a drug like fulvestrant versus in the non ESR-1 mutant patients. I think that question has meaningful read-through as to the overall value of the class. If it's really just limited or driven by the ESR-1 mutants. I think that's a very different proposition than a true all-comer effect size. As it relates to the combination data of ours, that -- those are data we'll probably present next year.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Jake. Carter, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala : Thank you. I have a couple of questions. First, is it not possible for Lilly to file Tirzepatide for obesity in 2022 on just the SURMOUNT-1 Trial with supporting weight loss data from the diabetes trials? Other follow-on indications for other drugs have been approved on one study, and SURMOUNT-1 is a trial of 2,400 patients, so it's a big trial. Second question, are you planning to use blood-based biomarkers such as P-tau217 as companion diagnostics with the -- or within the donanemab filing? I think you have used the [indiscernible] diagnostic in the Trailblazer trials. So wondering if that's part of the filing. Thank you.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Mike for the question on Tirzepatide and then Dan for the question on the [indiscernible] and submission of donanemab. Mike?\nMike B Mason: Yes, Steve good question. We -- in our discussions with the FDA, we've agreed upon 4 trials for the [indiscernible]program that make up our submission for the obesity indication for Tirzepatide. As I said earlier, those will read out -- SURMOUNT-1 will read out next year, SURMOUNT 2, 3, and 4 readout in '23 and we'll submit and expect approval in '24. Based on conversation with the FDA, when we set our development program, that's the current plan.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Mike. Dan.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks, too. Good question on companion diagnostics and their role in FDA approval of Alzheimer's drugs. I think based on what we've seen with ADU are base case expectation here is that the FDA is operating under an assumption that standard of care now for Alzheimer's disease, if you are diagnosing efficient for Alzheimer should include BioMark or confirmation of disease. So for that reason, my guess is that they won't be -- BiMark won't be included in prescribing information as companion diagnostics. I would take the opposite position probably with payers where I think they are likely to be required before reimbursement for these medicines but that has to has to be worked out.  So those assumptions I just laid out sort of underlie our thinking about how P-Tau or Amyvid or any other biomarkers, CSF beta will be incorporated into labels, probably not a d into practice, probably yes. And so we're proceeding accordingly to make sure that P-Tau 2017 is as well as other biomarkers can be widely available around the same time as we launched donanemab, so that it can be incorporated into the standards of clinical practice. As a biomarker for detecting Alzheimer's pathology and trashing patients to therapy.\nKevin Hearn: And thanks, Stan, Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. [Operator Instructions]\nMatthew Harrison: Okay. Great. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could comment on lebrikizumab and your sort of views on the market., and in particular, now that you've seen the Ox40 data from Amgen KK, if that has any impact on how you think about the longer-term potential of that market. Thanks.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks. Matthew will go to Patrick for the question on lebrikizumab.\nPatrick Johnson: Well, thank you very much for the question. We're very encouraged by the induction that [indiscernible] lebrikizumab, where we saw more than 50% of patients treated with lebrikizumab achieving an EASI-75 and that we'll also met all the key secondary endpoints and we actually believe that we have an opportunity here to launch a best-in-class [indiscernible]]. And currently we are looking forward to the 52 weeks based on [indiscernible] top of 2022 and a potential submission the second half of next year. When it comes [indiscernible]? days, it doesn't change our outlook for lebri.  As I share, we believe we have a best-in-class IL-13. And we also believe that we have a very competitive asset with the market leader. And base d in a market that we know there is a big unmet need, and by logic, penetration is still very low, and we know that there is a need for many more medications and particularly with the heterogenous need in the marketplace.\nKevin Hearn: Thanks, Patrik. Matthew, thanks for your question. We'll wrap up our Q&A. Go to Dave for our close.\nDavid Ricks : Great. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our Company. We continue to grow our broad commercial portfolio with strong momentum in our core business, supported by many key brands and accelerating classes. This is complemented by a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities. And we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow-up with Investor Relations. if you have any questions we did not address on the call and hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Dr. Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. Like 2020 before it, 2021 continues to be a very productive year for R&D at Lilly. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll highlight several updates from our late-stage pipeline. Starting with Tirzepatide. We shared detailed results from tirzepatide SURPASS-4 Study at EASD this quarter. SURPASS-4 is the largest and longest surpass trial completed to-date. And we were encouraged by the continued hemoglobin A1C and weight control, which participants experienced even past the initial 52-week treatment period, and continuing up to 2 years. Looking at slide 14, this shows the change from baseline in hemoglobin A1C over time during the study.  A1C reduction plateaued by roughly 24 weeks and was maintained at 52 weeks and thereafter, to 104 weeks across all the Tirzepatide doses. While in the insulin glargine comparator arm, A1C began to increase after 52 weeks. Durability of A1C control is a challenge for type 2 diabetes treatments. While the 104-week data isn't a definitive answer as to whether Tirzepatide could potentially offer even longer-term durable blood glucose control, these data certainly are encouraging. Moving to Slide 15, as you can see, weight loss plateaued at approximately 52 weeks and was maintained thereafter, such that at 2 years, weight difference at the highest dose was approximately 15% compared to insulin glargine.  We've seen in previous incretin therapy trials conducted with GLP-1 s a further increased impact on weight reduction in participants with obesity without type-2 diabetes compared to studies in participants who do have type two diabetes, such as this one. It will be interesting to see if this trend also extends to the dual agonism of Tirzepatide, which has demonstrated weight reductions in type two diabetes trials beyond what has been shown by GLP-1s to-date. We clearly are excited about the weight loss potential here and we believe the data to date bode well for upcoming readouts in obesity, starting with surmount one which reads out next-year. Tirzepatide represents a new class of medicines.  And we're focused on continuing our significant investment for patients with type two diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic disorders who may benefit from Tirzepatide. Moving to slide 16, today we announced the U.S. submission for Tirzepatide and Type II diabetes, and that we used a priority review voucher with the intention of bringing this investigational treatment to patients as quickly as possible. We are delighted that the continued progress for this novel dual agonist incretin and hope to obtain approval in the U.S. by the middle of next year. Moving to donanemab, we have several important updates for this program. First, in the U.S., we initiated a rolling BLA submission to the FDA for accelerated approval in early Alzheimer's disease.  We intend to complete the submission in the next few months and expect regulatory action in the second half of 2022. We've also completed the original planned enrollment of 1,500 participants for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2. And based on the pre -specified 18-month primary endpoint, expect to have topline results by the middle of 2023. We've added a separate single arm addendum for safety exposures to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, which has already enrolled more than 300 patients and is continuing to enroll rapidly. This addendum will provide us with additional safety data to support the rolling submission. Moving to TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, this is a prevention study for cognitively unimpaired individuals who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have clinical symptoms. We're excited to report that we have already initiated screening.  This pioneering trial has multiple novel elements to reduce research subject burden, including the use of our phospho-tau217 blood assay currently in development to help detect Alzheimer's disease pathology in the patient screening process. Video call technology for assessing cognitive function in the subject's home, and a large network of infusion centers that allow subjects to select the site most convenient to them in a decentralized clinical trial paradigm. We also announced today our plans to conduct a head-to-head Phase 3 study comparing donanemab to Aducanumab to assess superiority of brain amyloid plaque clearance in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  The co-primary endpoints will evaluate complete amyloid plaque clearance as measured by [indiscernible] pure FAT and PET scan, and will assess superiority on bringing amyloid plaque clearance in the total population, and also the intermediate [indiscernible] population. This study TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4 is expected to begin enrollment this year. And we expect to share primary endpoint data in the second half of 2022. We're encouraged with the progress we've made with the [indiscernible] and with its potential to positively impact patients with high unmet medical need. We have of course, followed progress in the Alzheimer's disease landscape since our last call, and are watching closely as CMS 's national coverage determination process plays out. We're committed to facing the challenges of effectively communicating donanemab 's, clinical data, and value proposition and to ensuring that the diagnostic and patient management ecosystems are adequately well - prepared. Given the current environment, we think it's reasonable to have modest expectations for the scale of patient impact for anti-amyloid therapies available under accelerated approval prior to the readout of their definitive Phase III data. Assuming potential accelerated approval for donanemab in the second half of 2022, are expected TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 phase three readout by mid-2023 would follow quickly, meaning the window of accelerated approval without definitive Phase II data is likely to be brief. Assuming positive Phase three results, we should be confident in the mid and long-term opportunity for donanemab if approved. Moving on to Verzenio. In-line with the expectations I outlined last quarter, we were pleased with Verzenio 's recent FDA approval as the first and only CDK4/6 inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy, for adult patients with HR-positive, HER2 -negative, node-positive early breast cancer, who are at high risk of recurrence with the Ki-67 index of greater than equal to 20% as detected by an FDA-approved test. This approval in the Adjuvan setting represents the first new addition to endocrine therapy and Adjuvan treatment of HR-positive QAR2 -negative breast cancer in nearly two decades.  We're delighted to bring this important new treatment option to patients. Also, we recently shared updated data from the entire monarchE study at the ESMO Virtual Plenary meeting and co-published these data in Annals of Oncology. These data, which reflect additional follow-ups since our last public presentation, highlight the robustness and the effect size we're seeing for Verzenio in the Adjuvan setting. Notably, with a median follow-up of 27 months, we are pleased to see both IDFS and DRFS benefit extend beyond the two-year study treatment period. These data are not only important for patients, but also to help dispel concerns that the curves would come back together over time.  We're clearly observing -- we've clearly observed continued separation of the curves, if not expanding separation. Since the Adjuvan approval two weeks ago, there's been questions regarding why the FDA approval applied only to a subset of the study population. As previously communicated, overall survival was a secondary outcome measure for the monarchy study. And an important component of the FDA's review. But we do not typically publish immature overall survival data, we feel it's valuable to address these important questions about the difference between the enrolled study population and the approved indication. As a result, while the overall survival data remain immature, we do plan to publish the [indiscernible] data from the additional follow-up analysis, with cut-off of April 1, 2021, in a medical journal in the coming days.  These data will show what we have observed thus far for overall survival trends in the ITT population compared to the approved population. We'll continue to follow patients in the ITT population for more mature overall survival data. If positive OS trend emerges in the ITT population, we plan to work with regulators to expand our Adjuvan indication. Importantly, the collective results from Verzenio clinical development program have demonstrated a differentiated CDK4/6 inhibitor profile. And we look forward to continued investment in Verzenio for breast and prostate cancer and are excited about the opportunity to serve more patients.  Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 22 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. They've been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In oncology, in addition to the exciting news for Verzenio, we continue our investment in Pirtobrutinib Phase III program with an additional study starting chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including fixed duration Pirtobrutinib plus Venetoclax and rituximab in relapsed or refractory patients. We plan to start a study in first-line treatment compared to bendamustine plus rituximab before year-end. We prioritize this first-line study rather than the head-to-head study evaluating superiority compared to brutinib as we think this first-line study could provide a faster pathway to bring Pirtobrutinib to patients in the first-line setting.  We expect the head-to-head brutinib CLL study to start in the first half of 2022. We look forward to sharing updated dataset from the Phase 1-2 BRUIN study at a medical meeting later this year, we plan to provide a regulatory update for Pirtobrutinib at our Investor Day in December. [inaudible 00:28:55] our oral [indiscernible], also moved into Phase 3, with the start of its monotherapy study compared to Exemestane or fulvestrant's. Finally, we also publicly identified and presented preclinical characterization for two new agents at the Molecular Targets meeting this month. LOXO 783, which is a highly mutant selective allosteric PI3K alpha inhibitor, and LOXO 435 which is a highly isoform -selective FGFR3 inhibitor.  We look forward to filing IND for both programs in 2022 and subsequently moving them into the clinic. In Diabetes, In addition to the Tirzepatide update, we obtained U.S. approval for Jardiance and HFpEF, presented detailed results from the emperor preserved study at the European Society of Cardiology and submitted for HFpEF in the US and Europe. We're excited about the opportunity Jardiance has to improve outcomes for patients across type II diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. We also started Phase II studies for our GLP-1 non-peptide agonist in collaboration with Chugai in type II diabetes and In obesity, and look forward to sharing some Phase I data from this molecule in December.  In immunology, we were delighted to have multiple positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, and look forward to the readout of the maintenance data from the ADvocate 1 and 2 studies in the first half of next year, ahead of global submissions expected by the end of 2022. We're pleased with our progress in immunology this year with positive Phase 3 readouts for mirikizumab and lebrikizumab, and look forward to sharing more about our next-generation of early phase immunology assets in December. In neurodegeneration, our anti-tau antibodies Zachatenamab recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's. Zachatenamab failed to meet the primary endpoint and was unable to modulate tau spread in the brain. The placebo population progressed as expected.  While this negative outcome was disappointing. And we're discontinuing development for Zachatenamab, we remain committed to Tao as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease, and plan to continue studying Tao biology, including inhibition of tau aggregation with a small-molecule OGA inhibitor currently in the clinic. In the pain therapeutic area, in collaboration with Pfizer, we discontinued the global clinical development program for tanezumab, following receipt of a complete response letter from the FDA for tanezumab in osteoarthritis pain and a negative opinion adopted by the CHMP.  And finally, the FDA expanded the emergency use authorization for Bamlanivimab and Aducanumab administered together to include post-exposure prophylaxis in certain individuals for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To recap, Q3 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, continuing the positive momentum we've seen with a steady stream of significant pipeline advancements over the last couple of years. As we move closer towards our goal of delivering more faster best-in-class treatment options to patients in areas of unmet need. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks. Great. Thanks, Jeff for two good questions. The first is just on the timing of the completion of the donanemab rolling submission. I think you can assume we chose our words carefully here in the call prepared remarks on the timing, you're driving out like what's the regulatory hurdle with respect to safety exposures. You're right, that's the key gating factor on timing. You've heard we've enrolled a lot of patients in the clinical trials, including patients in safety addendum. So, we're extremely confident we'll reach that safety exposure hurdle.  I guess, looking forward, there's probably two risks or question marks. One is just around the timing of exactly when do databases get locked and data get cleaned and submitted to the FDA. So that's why we're a little vague on timing here. I think the second one of course that we don't know and won't know until all that data is in, is what are the safety that actually show. And so the assumption here, of course, is that they continue to be consistent with what we've seen in Phase 2. So if those things work out, then I think that'll be the opportunity to talk a little more specifically about the data.  With respect to zagotenemab, look, I think we have here a very potent anti-tau antibody designed against what we believe is an important species of aggregated tau delivered at a relatively high doses for any monoclonal antibody, and we were unable to slow the spread of tau progression in the brain. So as present, I don't see a path forward for this antibody and I would be reluctant to invest in really any anti -tau antibody, given what we've seen here, Tau is still a great target, it's just hard to hit it with a monoclonal antibody, I think, given that most of the tau that we care about is inside of cells. Thanks Andrew for the question on anti-drug antibodies or ADA's. We do see ADA's with donanemab, they arise pretty early in treatment. There's no connection though with the ADA and our decision on fixed duration dosing. The reason for that is because the doses that we're using are so much higher than the level of anti-drug antibodies that we don't see an effect in our clinical trials that these doses of the ADA's on PK or importantly on PD, which is the plaque clearance effect of donanemab, so no connection there. Thanks. Our question is whether the Nan members that it can amount trial head-to-head trial, will be powered to measure clinical efficacy outcomes. It will not be. It is a small and a shorter trial. So we won't be able to draw conclusions about that. But I'd point out that if we believe that plaque Luring is the appropriate surrogate and that question will certainly be answered in the next year to 18 months as we get data from a number of Phase three plaque-lowering drugs, so if it turns out that plaque lowering is an appropriate surrogate for predicting clinical efficacy, then I think that the degree and speed of plaque lowering could be the basis of comparison across different Alzheimer's drugs in the same way that surrogates in oncology to used to compare different drugs in a class, knowing that the long-term outcome trials would have to be extremely large and long duration, powered for clinical outcomes. I also sort of point out that we we're expecting here to have in the scenario where we're really excited about this, we're expecting to have a positive Phase 3 trial for donanemab, which in itself is a differentiator, I think from current competitors. So head-to-head on efficacy against Adjuvan may not actually be relevant. Yeah. Thanks for your question, Carter. I think you're appropriately pointing out that actually both things matter in terms of plaque clearance, how fast you clear the plaques, and also how deep you clear the plaques. I think in the fullness of time when we have Phase 3 readouts for multiple drugs that look at efficacy, I predict those would be 2 important predictor factors and how well a drug helps patients is, how quickly and how deeply it clears plaques. I think we have significant [indiscernible] there in both aspects with donanemab. So you can be sure we'll be looking at both of those things and reporting that out as I said in the back-half of next year. Yeah. Thanks, too. Good question on companion diagnostics and their role in FDA approval of Alzheimer's drugs. I think based on what we've seen with ADU are base case expectation here is that the FDA is operating under an assumption that standard of care now for Alzheimer's disease, if you are diagnosing efficient for Alzheimer should include BioMark or confirmation of disease. So for that reason, my guess is that they won't be -- BiMark won't be included in prescribing information as companion diagnostics. I would take the opposite position probably with payers where I think they are likely to be required before reimbursement for these medicines but that has to has to be worked out.  So those assumptions I just laid out sort of underlie our thinking about how P-Tau or Amyvid or any other biomarkers, CSF beta will be incorporated into labels, probably not a d into practice, probably yes. And so we're proceeding accordingly to make sure that P-Tau 2017 is as well as other biomarkers can be widely available around the same time as we launched donanemab, so that it can be incorporated into the standards of clinical practice. As a biomarker for detecting Alzheimer's pathology and trashing patients to therapy."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the Third Quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 18% this quarter compared to Q3, 2020 or 11% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for core business, despite the impact of Alimta's OUS [indiscernible] We continue to be pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Paul's, Verzenio and Jardiance as our key growth products made up nearly 60% of our core business during the quarter.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined ten basis points to 79% in Q3. Favorable products mix excluding COVID-19 therapies, and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold were more than offset by lower gross margin on COVID-19 therapies. Total operating expenses grew eight percent this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased one percent while R and D expenses increased 17% driven by significant investments in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including the non [indiscernible], [indiscernible]and [indiscernible].  We also invested approximately $50 million in research and development for COVID-19 therapies in Q3, bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately 350 million year-to-date. Operating income increased 37% compared to Q3 2020. And operating income as a percent of revenue was 30.5% for the quarter, an increase of 420 basis points compared to the prior year with sequential growth for second straight quarter. This increase was driven by revenue growth, outpace, and expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense were expense of $7 million for this quarter compared to income of 10 million in Q3 2020. Our effective tax rate was 14.3%, a decrease of 70 basis points compared with the same quarter last year.  The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2021 was driven by a mix of earnings and lower tax jurisdiction, partially offset by a decrease in net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2020. At the bottom line, we delivered strong growth as earnings per share increased 38% in Q3, 2021. On slide 9, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth, and we're encouraged by the growth seen across the world. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 26% compared to third quarter of 2020. Adjusting for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, revenue grew 14% in the US. This increase, driven largely by volume, was led by Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, and Verzenio.  The higher net realized price in the U.S. this quarter was driven by lower utilization in the 340B segment. Unfavorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Trulicity in the third quarter of 2020 and modest list price increases, partially offset by increased rebates to maintain broad patient access for our medicine. Our year-to - date U.S. net price decrease of 1% is in line with the low-to-mid single-digit guidance we gave last December, and our full-year outlook is consistent with those expectations.  Our 340B limited distribution program began September 2020, and so the fourth quarter of 2021 will be the first full quarter where its impact will also be including the base period when calculating year-over-year price changes in the U.S. Given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business. Moving to Europe, revenue grew 3% in constant currency, excluding the impact of the first full quarter of loss of exclusivity for Alimta. Revenue grew 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz and Verzenio. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth, excluding Alimta.  In Japan, revenue decreased 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by the decline of post-patent products. Revenue in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. Now, including Alimta as well as the by -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, our key growth products grew 12% in Q3 in Japan. We expect improved revenue growth in Japan moving forward based on the uptake of these newer products. In China, revenue grew 30% in constant currency primarily driven by continued uptake of Tyvyt and Trulicity. We're excited by the significant growth we're seeing in China with sales of new medicine continue to drive growth there.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 16% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate and volume effects on revenue for our September year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove 15 percentage point of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products.  In total, these brands generated nearly $3.9 billion in revenue this quarter, and made up 58% of our core business revenue. We are encouraged by the strength of our key growth products in Q3, collectively up over 35% compared to the same period in prior year. Trulicity, Verzenio and Jardiance all continued to outgrow their respective classes. and we're pleased with Taltz growth driven by increased access. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2021, we invested $7 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays, and capital investments. In addition, we returned over 2.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and have repurchased $500 million in stock.  We will continue to fund the growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline, seek external innovation to augment our future growth prospects, and return capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on slide 13, we're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We're increasing the full-year revenue outlook by 200 million at the top end of the range, and 400 million at the lower end of the range to reflect additional COVID-19 antibody revenue. And the outlook for a core business. COVID-19 antibody revenue expectations are roughly 1.3 billion based on the existing U.S. government purchasing agreements for additional doses of etesevimab in Q3 and Q4.  The net impact of these changes is an update revenue range of $27.2 billion to $27.6 billion, up from the previous range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. As we noted last quarter, investments in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches are expected to push us to the top end of our guidance range for operating expenses. Our reported and non-GAAP operating margin guidance is unchanged, Excluding the impact of COVID-19 antibodies, non-GAAP operating margin remains approximately 31%. Our non-GAAP ranges for other income and expense and our expected tax rate remains unchanged as well.  On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of 250 million -- 250 million, reflecting the impact of the charges associated with a repurchase of debt and net mark-to-market losses on investments in equity securities. In the Third Quarter of 2021, the 2021 effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 11% on a reported basis, reflecting the tax impact of the charges associated with the repurchase of debt and acquired IP R&D, as well as unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments in equity securities in the third quarter of 2021. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share has been raised to 795 to 805, while the GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.38 to $6.48. At our Investor's Day in December, we will share our initial 2022 guidance.  Today, before I turn the call over to Dan for the R&D update, I'd like to provide a few reminders on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as we begin thinking about the next year. In Q3, we saw the initial impact of Alimta's OUS patent expiry in Europe and Japan. Next year, we will see its full-year impact, as well as the U.S. patent expiry, with limited launches from a single generic Company in Q1 before the full launch of generic entrants starting in Q2. As for revenue from COVID-19 therapies, we intend to reflect in guidance our expectations related to signed purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies.  Currently we expect minimal revenue from COVID-19 therapies in 2022 leading to more difficult year-over-year comparisons. As we do this year, we will provide commentary on our financials excluding the impact of revenue and certain expenses from COVID-19 therapies to enable more healthful year-over-year comparison of the performance of our core business [indiscernible] major use drugs price and reform, our 2022 and mid-term outlook continues to be mid-single-digit net price erosion in the U.S. and globally, is the impact of lower utilization of 340B segments moved into the base pace period as we enter Q4, 2021.  we continue to invest in our bright future as we advance promising R&D opportunities in scale up to support exciting potential launches from our late-stage pipeline. While these investments may pressure operating margin in the near term, they are critical to maximizing pipeline opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid to long-term. Now I will turn over the call to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Great. Thanks. So for 2022, we will provide further details and guidance in a couple -- in December, so not too far from now, and we'll provide additional carry on how we view the year and what investments and pushes and pulls we have going into next year. As you think about our margin expansion and the goals we've set out and we've communicated in terms of getting to mid-to-high 30s, in terms of margin expansion, we still have a clear line of sight to get there, and that's still our goal.  There will be -- but it's not a linear growth, so there will be years that are going to be stronger years, or we're going to be making specific targeted investments. And as you've seen us do this year with donanemab when we have strong convictions in the pipeline asset or when we're preparing to launch very promising opportunities and products, we will invest behind them. So think about this as still growing to mid-to-high 30s, but not necessarily in a linear fashion, but in line with investments we would need to make. Well, as Dan stated and as our competitor has shared, they've experienced there clearly is work to do to ensure that the diagnostic and the patient ecosystems are prepared for these medicines. And until there is definitive phase three data, we do believe that we should really expect modest use of these medicine. Now fortunately, as Dan said, for donanemab, this confirmatory data comes quickly in mid-23 for travelers are all too. And so this will be the opportunity to really help patients on a more significant scale. Now, some of the opportunities here, certainly pursuing accelerated approval is really important, both to provide early access. but also to let us begin addressing some of these infrastructure challenges ahead of the Phase three data. We need to build out the diagnostic ecosystem, particularly PET scans and blood tests. We need to make sure that there's adequate infusion capacity. And then very importantly, we need to ensure that there's reimbursements so that the appropriate patients can have access to donanemab. So these are going to be our areas of focus now through our phase 3 window. We're confident in our ability to address these infrastructure challenges over time. And I would say by clearing plaque faster and deeper, we believe that as well as identifying the right patients, we've optimized the chances for showing compelling benefits in the Phase III, which is we said is what was going to show significant uptake in the class. We continue to see the same opportunity for donanemab in the mid to long term once these challenges are addressed and the confirmatory data is available. Sure. So as we're preparing to launch both these medicines, obvious 1 is in an area where we have significant commercial footprint, manufacturing scale up capabilities and the other 1 is an area we're currently building. So, we're investing in advancing both of these efforts forward preparing for potential launch of Tirzepatide mid next year, and then a regulatory decision on donanemab by the second half of next year. Those will be factored into the guidance that we will provide on December 15th as we go into -- as we go into next year. But rest assured we're building the commercial footprint that we needed to launch these effectively and leveraging the existing footprint we have as well."

            "name": "Mike B Mason",
            "content": "Hi, Seamus. First of all, you are 100% right. We're looking very closely at the obesity opportunity for Tirzepatide. We're very excited about the weight loss that we solve in type 2 diabetes patients, of up to 14% weight loss, and the potential of that being even higher in the obesity population. Obviously, just a massive unmet need 110 million Americans live with obesity. Only about 3% of them are treated with some type of anti-obesity medication. So we think the opportunity is huge to really help people who live with chronic weight management issues. Now, with our program, we have four trials in us surmount obesity registration program.  Our first obesity trial will read out next year or SURMOUNT-1 We're very excited to see that that should happen in mid next year. And then, SURMOUNT-1 2, 3, and 4, we'll get the day of those trials are on track to wrap up in 23. And then so when you look at our obesity submission and approval, it looks like our approval in 2024 is most likely outcome. If everything goes well as we expect in our SURMOUNT program. So very excited about -- with all these launches. I think they've done a nice job. I think not a surprise to us. We thought that what was holding back the current market was just the current products in the marketplace just didn't have clinically meaningful enough weight loss.  We thought if we had products on the marketplace that had clinically meaningful weight loss and those products were able to show good, clinical outcomes, overall medical outcomes for those living with obesity, that position for [inaudible 00:56:27] and payers would provide access for it. So it's not going to develop overnight, but we're very encouraged by the early launch and we go big, and just very excited about Tirzepatide 's opportunity. Yeah. Thanks, Dave. First of all, when we look at Semglee, it's only interchangeable with the reference product, which is Lantus, not Basaglar, so we do think it's going to have a more of an impact on Lantus versus Basaglar. I mean, you look at the mill time segments, that first reference product will be insulin aspart, not LifePro (PH). Now I think you also have to take a look at the assemblies interchangeable biosimilar.  I think many stakeholders in Washington believe that Semglee interchangeable insulin would launch at a significant discounted price. Now, that hasn't been the case. The net impact of assembly's interchange will launch is actually the introduction of a higher-priced presentation, not a lower-price presentation. The new presentation is priced at $269 a vial versus $99 a vial of the original singly, which is a 273% increase. So I think what you're not going to see, at least what we haven't seen in the insulin biosimilar space is that the Semglee interchangeable will we're really disrupt the basal insulin market.  Rather, what we'll do is allow it to compete and kind of their traditional healthcare system that we know have gaps which we talked about earlier and which we've been trying to fill with our insulin value program and the senior savings model. When you look at in kind of pivot to the mealtime insulin market, mealtime insulin is a bit more complicated. They require more presentations than what you see with a basal insulin. So, premixes are human insulin are also included on the contract. So I think the mealtime insulin is a little bit different than what you see on the basal insulin.  But what we've seen to-date is that given [indiscernible] and our price point on interchangeability, we don't think it's going to be really disruptive to the system, but more work within the current system, which we feel that we can strongly defend. At the end of day, I think, to reiterate Dave 's point, I think it's better when we're focused on improvements. and with our Connected Care launch with BIF, with our weekly basal insulin, I think we're focused on really driving innovation and better patient outcomes. Yes, Steve good question. We -- in our discussions with the FDA, we've agreed upon 4 trials for the [indiscernible]program that make up our submission for the obesity indication for Tirzepatide. As I said earlier, those will read out -- SURMOUNT-1 will read out next year, SURMOUNT 2, 3, and 4 readout in '23 and we'll submit and expect approval in '24. Based on conversation with the FDA, when we set our development program, that's the current plan."

            "content": "Well, thank you very much. In terms of the question related to rheumatoid arthritis, the FDA has requested changes to the box warning for all JAK inhibitors to include serious heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and deaths. And we believe in life about its most likely that the JAKs will be placed off of the biologic source of the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. And that's Mediamath Olumiant is currently played in the U.S. so we don't see any major impact on Olumiant driven by this change. When we moved our atopic dermatitis, we know about the FDA meets their PDUFA due to the ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. And we believe also here, it's most likely above the JAK inhibitors, will end up being placed off to the biologics. Despite that, we also recognize that atopic dermatitis is a very heterogeneous disease. And our clinicians have a use for more tools in the toolbox, but that's what we believe is most likely moving forward. And we would expect some regulatory actions prior to the end of this year. Well, thank you very much for the question. We're very encouraged by the induction that [indiscernible] lebrikizumab, where we saw more than 50% of patients treated with lebrikizumab achieving an EASI-75 and that we'll also met all the key secondary endpoints and we actually believe that we have an opportunity here to launch a best-in-class [indiscernible]]. And currently we are looking forward to the 52 weeks based on [indiscernible] top of 2022 and a potential submission the second half of next year. When it comes [indiscernible]? days, it doesn't change our outlook for lebri.  As I share, we believe we have a best-in-class IL-13. And we also believe that we have a very competitive asset with the market leader. And base d in a market that we know there is a big unmet need, and by logic, penetration is still very low, and we know that there is a need for many more medications and particularly with the heterogenous need in the marketplace."

Once again, Lilly had a very strong quarter growing our newest medicines around the world and continuing to advance significant potential new medicines in the late-stage development. While also building long-term opportunities through early-stage investments in technology and progress in early-stage programs. Q3 2021 was also a period where the resilience of our Company, our people and collaborators were tested by the pandemic. And again, they rose to the challenge on, personally recognize and thank my Lilly teammates for delivering such a strong overall performance. Innovating to maintain pipeline velocity, running our plans to meet the rapidly growing demand of medicines and continuing to serve our customers, whether be in person or online. Turning to our strategic deliverables on slide 4, Q3 revenue grew 18% compared to Q3 2020, or 17% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume. Volume growth was 17 percentage points. When excluding COVID-19 therapies, which includes revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew an estimated 11% for the quarter and year-to-date. Revenue attributable to our newer medicines grew over 35% and now represents nearly 60% of our core business this quarter, an important indicator for our long-term growth potential. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3 or 79.3%, excluding for the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, our gross margin decreased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 30.5%, representing an improvement of over 400 basis points compared to Q3 of last year. And over 100 basis points of sequential improvement from Q2 of this year. We had a number of significant pipeline milestones since our last earnings call in August.  Including the FDA approvals for Verzenio and certain people with high-risk early breast cancer. And for Jardiance and collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Regulatory submissions for Tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes in the U.S. to which we applied a priority review voucher, as well as the EU, and Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We initiated a rolling submission in the U.S. for donanemab in early Alzheimer's disease and had positive Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis. We also continue to augment our pipeline with these development opportunities as we continue to leverage external innovation to build our discovery capabilities with a focus on new modalities at Lilly. In Q3, we announced a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Lycia Therapeutics to utilize their proprietary protein degradation technology. Finally on financials, we distributed nearly $800 million to shareholders via the dividend this quarter. Moving to slides 5 and 6, you'll a see list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including issuing the company's first sustainability bond with proceeds allocated toward environmental projects, including pollution prevention, energy efficiency, and renewable energy, as well as social projects to increase access to essential services and social economic advancement and empowerment.  We announced a series of leadership and organizational changes this quarter. Recent positive data readouts this year led us to the natural decision to increase our focus on immunology and NeuroScience and to unify the Loxo Oncology and Lilly Oncology organizations. We believe these changes enhance our ability to execute on a broad range of exciting commercial and pipeline opportunities. I'd like to welcome Jake Van Arden, to Lilly's Executive Committee, and look forward to Ann, Patrick and Jake continuing their leadership in their new roles. They'll be focused on increasing our competitiveness in their therapeutic areas and growing our existing medicines while also launching our late-stage pipeline of new medicines which could benefit patients across a diverse set of medical conditions.  Similarly, I'm grateful for Ilias (ph) continued leadership and look forward to him leading our growing international business. Finally, I would like to thank [indiscernible] for his impact on our Company across more than three decades of his commitment to patients, to development of our industry-leading commercial capabilities and his relentless focus on execution and mentorship of countless Lilly leaders. Kudo (ph) thank you for your service to our Company. We have a deep leadership venture at Lilly. They're smart, they're energetic and experienced. And I know they're as excited as I am to take Lilly to another level in the decade ahead. Now I will turn the call over to Anat to review our Q3 results and provide an update on our financial guidance for 2021. Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during the quarter. We have seen continued strength in our core business through the first 9 months of the year, with double-digit volume-driven revenue growth net of COVID-19 therapies and strong performance across key brands. We're pleased to see sequential and year-over-year operating margin expansions, as well as strong non-GAAP earnings growth. We have made significant progress developing new medicines. And Q3 was another important quarter for our pipeline as we announced the submission of Tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes, the initiation of a rolling submission for donanemab in the U.S. for early Alzheimer's disease, key life cycle approvals, and submissions for Verzenio and Jardiance, and positive Phase 3 readouts for lebrikizumab.We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends in Q3, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we move toward the close of 2021, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. While the past year has seen tremendous advances in our late-stage pipeline, at our Investor Day in December, we look forward to sharing information with you regarding the next generation of assets that we believe will enable us to sustain the flow of innovative medicines to patients and augment our future growth prospects. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Obviously, there's a lot of talking and discussing going on in Washington about how to Mig medicines more affordable. I think we've been pretty consistent in our view that both as Lilly and I think I can speak for the industry here we are for progress. We're not for the status quo and the centerpiece of almost every part of legislation being discussed which is I think good news for seniors is some reform to the Part D benefit. That is certainly highlighted in representative Peter's Bill. It's in HR-19, it was in the aggressive widen effort. It's I'm sure in the Senate Finance effort now, and I think that's good news. The contours of that are all kind of different, but the general idea is that industry would pay additional costs into the system, that that would reduce monthly out-of-pocket costs, both below and above the catastrophic phase cap -- catastrophic costs as well as eliminate the donut hole.  I think we're basically for all those things and we think that's a good set of initiatives. Where the debate sort of kicks in is around how to pay for that, or whether pay for from the industry should go to other healthcare priorities. And of course, we have clear positions on that. One piece of Peter's Bill we don't like is the retroactive CPI Cap. I think that's punitive and unfair. It also is disproportionate on some types of medicines versus others. So I think the industry is aligned, [indiscernible] we don't care for that. Although in general, the idea of a CPI regulator on forward price increases is something people have gotten used to talking about.  And then the thing we do, put our foot down and firmly opposed and why we're so against HR3 and other efforts, is taking money out of the pharmaceutical industry for other priorities. Isn't drug pricing a big enough problem? Why don't we take the money out of pharmaceutical industry and give it to patients who want to buy our medicines. And that's a position we've had for a long time. I think it's been a busy week and into next week, probably negotiating out this package, but we're hopeful that some of these messages are resonating and we could land with a Part D reform and modest impact on the industry so we can keep innovating for the future. Sure. Happy to. Maybe before we go to me, Jake do you have any comments on the FDA comments on China data? As it relates, Ronny, to the broader question about why not more everyday low-priced strategies in the main and pharmaceuticals. I mean, I think a couple of things come to mind here. First, I think in oncology in particular, it is infeasible quite often to run comparative studies. And so once an incumbent is established, it's very difficult to displace that incumbent. Maybe the one narrow exception might be what Jake highlighted with Sintilimab where you could have a more price-sensitive segment. And here we have analogous data from a different country that was conducted in a time-gap that was prior to other PD-1s being approved in that setting. And so that presents an opportunistic play.  We have of course also pursued this in insulin and Mike can comment on that in a second. But basically, our launch to the 30% discount to the other insulin glargine. We've pursued our own low-cost authorized generic of Humalog, now reducing the price to effectively 70% off the original brand. But here again, it illustrates the point Jake was making is that even in the retail side, it's not universally adopted. Today the half-price form of Humalog and the third off-price of insulin glargine that we provide have minority market shares and that's a little bit counter-intuitive. But of course, we all know the incentives of the supply chain which do tend to favor higher list price products, and that's I think where that shows up. Finally, you asked why don't we pursue this for our whole portfolio?  Well, I think the overriding thought for our portfolio was often to create differentiated datasets. And 1 thing different from [indiscernible] different from [indiscernible] and authorize generic, Humalog is that those aren't differentiated datasets. So they're more or less interchangeable. So when we create a new medicine, we're seeking to create something better. And in the main, that's how the system is set up and that favors typically an introductory price that's similar to other innovative competitors and then rebating and discounting to the channel to get formulary access and use. And that remains our main strategy.  Of course, if there were some big policy shifts that flattened gross to net or reduced, somehow, the incentives of intermediaries, we'd take a look at that. I think our goal would be to deliver lower cost points to consumers if we could. Right now, mostly the system rewards something else and that's how we are forward planning for the portfolio that Dan was talking about. Maybe Mike has any final comments on insulin and interchangeability. Kerry, you were kind of breaking in and out, but I think these are for Jake. And the 1st question, Jake, if you didn't catch it, was about quarter-on-quarter revenue And whether that was affected by pricing in CDK46th market or rather the stocking point you made earlier. And then I think the 2nd point was about IDFS versus OS in the FDA 's policy [indiscernible] that. Great. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our Company. We continue to grow our broad commercial portfolio with strong momentum in our core business, supported by many key brands and accelerating classes. This is complemented by a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities. And we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all of our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow-up with Investor Relations. if you have any questions we did not address on the call and hope you have a great day."

            "name": "Jake Van Arden",
            "content": "Thanks, Seamus. So just starting with Verzenio performance in the quarter. As you probably remember, we had some stocking that happened in the channel in the second quarter, and so part of what happened this quarter is just a modest work down of that inventory. I think the fundamentals of where we stand in the metastatic setting continue to look really strong. I like where we are in terms of NBRX share hopping around 30% hopefully we can continue to grow that. I think that we still haven't seen the entire class of CDK46 inhibitors returns of pre - COVID levels of prescriptions. And so that's obviously an important lever for growth going forward. Probably levered to things like mammogram volumes and other types of preventative care measures that get patients diagnosed and into doctor's offices. But we continue to grow our share of NBRX within the market. Turning to Adjuvan, obviously, we're very excited about launching this medicine for men and women with early breast cancer specifically Ki-67 high patients. It's a real opportunity as I think you've probably heard say before. It's about 8,000-10,000 patients. It's obviously a smaller opportunity than the entire study population that we enrolled in monarchy. And as you know, we'll be looking -- again, next year will be the next analysis of survival to potentially expand to that broader population, should OS trend in the direction that we and FDA want to see to do that. But we have a great opportunity ahead of us. I think certainly it's growth from where we stand today. It's a brand-new indication of real size in terms of both patient numbers and duration. In many ways, that -- realizing that is also linked to the prior comments I made about patients returning to the doctor for preventative care to get diagnosed at levels, hopefully that return to pre -COVID. We don't need that obviously to make headway going into next year, but I think for the long term, it's important for patients to make sure they get into the physician's office to get diagnosed. Hey, Umer, thanks for the question. So Sintilimab, the PD-1 inhibitor from Innovent, we brought in to the Company in terms of ex-China right explicitly with the intent to use pricing as a lever to disrupt the U.S. market starting with the United States and potentially moving to Europe as well. And as we've said publicly over the past couple of months, the intent there is really through price predominantly versus other mechanisms such as rebating etc. There are certain customers out there, certain practices, and care models for which this is going to be an attractive tool for lowering costs to their system. And Unfortunately for the way the system is designed today, they are going to be many channels for which a lower-priced option actually isn't appealing. And so as you -- your question was about whether or not we intend to be a dominant player? It's hard for me to say that with any degree of assertion today. We will be focusing, initially, on the segments for which this is an attractive option, given the way that their payer dynamics work. And today that's not a majority by any stretch, but that will be our focus out of the [indiscernible] should [inaudible 01:00:27] be approved. Onto your second question about whether or not the data package that's been generated for the agent will have issues with prescribers in the United States. Our market research today suggests this won't be an issue.  But obviously we haven't launched the product yet, we haven't gotten it approved yet, so I can't say that with certainty that our market research suggests it won't be an issue. But really in front of us initially is just getting the drug approved, and I think as you know, that's something we hope for in the early part of next year. But the drug will be subject to an advisory committee and we await the details of what that will cover. Yeah. I think it's a good observation. We've observed the same thing. The tone from DC does seem to have changed a bit over the past 18 months on this topic. So I think we're hearing and reading in some ways, probably the same things that you guys are. We don't have a lot more information than that. And so we await again the regulatory decision from FDA as to the acceptability of the package. Yes. Thanks. On the 1st point, yes. I mean, the sequential quarters are really mostly related to the inventory stocking and destocking point that I made earlier. We haven't seen a ton of fluctuation in price. On your comment about Adjuvan, I can't comment on the back and forth that Novartis had with FDA, just obviously not privy to that. Though from what you -- the framing of your question, that actually doesn't sound particularly different than the conversation that we've had with the agency. As Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've of course, as you can imagine, gotten a fair number of questions from folks around the nature of the approval in the subgroup versus the enrolled population among RD.  And we'll be publishing in the coming days, the actual OS overall survival data that were part of the regulatory submission. You'll see what those trends look like in both the intent-to-treat population as well as the approved subset. And again, trends in one direction or another that you'll be able to interpret for yourself. But I don't -- from what I can hear, I don't think the Novartis feedback from the agency is all that different from what we've received. Yeah. Thanks for the questions about their old cert program. We're looking forward to seeing the radius Menarini data at San Antonio as I'm sure you are. That's studies. are a little interesting and that is very heavily enriched for ESR-1 mutated tumors. And so, we're interested in seeing the degree to which the effect size observed in the study was really driven by that enriched subgroup where you would expect an outsized effect size versus a drug like fulvestrant versus in the non ESR-1 mutant patients. I think that question has meaningful read-through as to the overall value of the class. If it's really just limited or driven by the ESR-1 mutants. I think that's a very different proposition than a true all-comer effect size. As it relates to the combination data of ours, that -- those are data we'll probably present next year."

            "name": "Anne",
            "content": "Well, it's a good question that you've asked and I -- I do think there's a number of things that are challenged here. I think as you look at donanemab what's incredibly important is that we had a positive phase 2 study that cleanly met its primary endpoint, showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, as well we're able to share that we had limited duration dosing to plaque clearance and so we believe that this is going to be important for the decisions that physicians and payers make. So I believe the donanemab data is incredibly strong. And then as I said, following quickly the Phase 3 confirmatory data, which I think is important, and all of this being published in the New England Journal of Medicine. So as we're talking to thought leaders and physicians, I do believe that they see the strength of the data that we brought forward in donanemab, and I think that's been a challenge that they've had with some of the competitive space. So I do think that data is one thing on their minds. I think it's well the NCD is playing a role, obviously that will be resolved before we launch and that will be ready for any of the potential out comes there. And I have been working closely with them along the way to make sure that they understand the donanemab data, particularly the rapid clearing of plaques as well as the limited duration dosing that offers we think benefit to them as well. So, it's been a good conversation with them. So far, we really look forward to seeing what they have to say CMS has the same in January and then launching with the strong datasets as Dan said in the second half of next year. Well, thanks. Good questions on the process for the NCD. So CMS has been clear that the NCD, as they are running the process is to cover the class. Now as I said, we are actively participating in the process, including we provided oral comments in July. And additional written comments in August, and we and I'm sure others as well have been meeting with CMS throughout the process to share our specific data and ensure that the differences in these medicines are understood. And so we've asked them really to evaluate each drug based on their own data. And this is, I think, as I said, particularly important considering that there are some differences between these. We share the data later in the air subsequent to the original readout that the degree of donanemab plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit which I know is very important to CMS in this decision as well as the limited duration dosing. So we really look forward to seeing what they have to say in January, and what readout will look like. We do acknowledge there's a lot of skepticism in the national discussion. And so we do really hope and we'll continue to influence that we think it's drugs should be evaluated by CMS, by payers and prescribers on their own data. It is possible that NCD, the NCD will narrow for the patients most likely the benefit that's a possibility out of this. But that's really aligned with the goals that we've had on our clinical trial designs, which has long been to use the diagnostic tools to make sure that the right patients are getting treatment. So we'll look forward to the readout in January. We'll continue to stay very engaged in this. And yes, I believe as additional data comes out, our data and others in the class, that this will continue to influence the process. Great. Well, thanks for the question on Emgality. So at present, what we've seen is the total migraine prescription market has seen growth but it's driven primarily by the total acute new patient starts and additional concomitant use. With the injectable class, I do think that we're still experiencing headwinds from the pandemic and increased competition in the prevention space overall. We do see some variability of this across the markets, some OUS markets are returning really to pre - COVID growth levels. And while we've seen improvement in the volume of new patient starts, the CGRP MAB class in the U.S. is still about 13% below where we were with the start of the pandemic. So with the new competition and then appropriate treatment for acute and prevention, we're seeing that the market should continue to grow as patient's reengage in the system.  On your question on oral impact, I think it's still a bit early to -- early days in the launches to see how this has impacted the space in this way. So we'll watch that carefully. I think our belief is that with so many patients and so much unmet need, the opportunity for these medicines, particularly the MAB,remains significance. And obviously in the end it comes down to what's best for that patient and how we get them to their migraine-free days. And that's one place that we think we believe [indiscernible] has an advantage. So, we'll continue to watch this space. We continue to believe in the efficacy that [indiscernible]brings to the market. And so, you'll see us continue to push forward in supporting the product."

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Kevin Hern. Please go ahead.\nKevin Hern: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2021 earnings call. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Oncology; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly Bio-Medicines; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo Oncology at Lilly. We are also joined by Lauren Zierke, [indiscernible] Sara Smith of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Forms 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional, and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  As we transition to our prepared remarks, a reminder that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for a summary of our second quarter results. \nDavid Ricks : Thank you, Kevin. Q2 of last year was the peak of the pandemic\u2019s negative impact to our business. And one year later, I'm proud of the innovation and resilience displayed by my Lilly colleagues to deliver against our objectives in new ways, while also mobilizing to develop treatments to help combat COVID-19. Looking at Q2 2021, we were encouraged by the increasing worldwide vaccination rates, as well as the underlying environment in most of our major markets. COVID-19 related stocking in Q1 followed by destocking in Q2 of last year, complicates quarterly performance comparisons. Therefore, looking at revenue growth in the first half of 2021 better reflects the underlying trends in our business. On today's call, we will provide year-over-year comparisons for both Q2 and the first half of the year. In the first half of 2021, we delivered 11% growth in our core business. This excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, this was buoyed by strong volume driven growth across key brands in major geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and China.  Turning specifically to Q2, revenue grew 23% compared to Q2 2020, or 20% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 22 percentage points. As previously highlighted, in Q2 2020, we saw reversal of the $250 million pandemic related product stocking which occurred in Q1 2020. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue, the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking and the sale of Cialis in China, our core business grew 12% for the quarter, up from 7% in Q1 on the same basis.  We were pleased to see sequential top line growth in the core business this quarter, signaling that healthcare systems continue recovery from the pandemic and the strength of our underlying business. Key growth products continue to drive our revenue growth and represent 54% of our core business this quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% in Q2, or 79.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding the FX impact, our gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 29.4%, representing an improvement of nearly 140 basis points. We were pleased to see operating margin expand year-over-year and we expect continued expansion in the second half of this year.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our earnings call in April, including receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation for donanemab and announcing our plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway; announcing positive Phase 3 results for tirzepatide SURPASS-4 trial with planned global submissions of the SURPASS program for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes by the end of 2021; obtaining approval for Jardiance in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for HFrEF in Europe; and announcing positive Phase 3 results from the EMPEROR-Preserved trial for Jardiance in HFpEF, the first and only successful trial for this patient population; and initiating Phase 3 trial results for pirtobrutinib in mantle-cell lymphoma, tirzepatide in HFpEF and Verzenio in HR+ HER2+ early breast cancer, and now, prostate cancer.  We also continue to augment our pipeline with business development deals and announced the acquisition of Protomer Technologies. We welcome the Protomer team to Lilly and are excited to bring this technology to our diabetes pipeline. As we believe glucose sensing is one, maybe become the next generation for insulin treatment to improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes.  Lastly, on financials, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in the quarter and authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion in stock in addition to the $500 million authorization remaining under our 2018 share repurchase program. Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including a May webcast, which highlighted our updated environmental, social and governance strategy and our sustainability efforts, as well as the launch of a new ESG website to serve as a comprehensive resource to provide increased transparency regarding the company's ESG goals and progress. Further, as part of our goal to become carbon-neutral in our own operations at our manufacturing plant in Kinsale, we recently inaugurated a new solar field, which is now the largest in Ireland. We also announced donations of COVID-19 therapies at no cost to low income and lower middle income countries, heavily impacted by the pandemic, and are proud of the impact we\u2019re having around the world, as we work to combat COVID-19. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slides 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 23% this quarter compared to Q2 2020 or 12% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for our core business. Given the COVID-19 related stocking, and destocking seen between Q1 and Q2 of 2020, our first half performance of 11% revenue growth or 8% in constant currency, excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance, and the sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue growth better represent the strength in our core business. Sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 for core business, increase in vaccination rates in many major markets, and the majority of our sales reps now being back in the field, suggests the recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We're particularly pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio in the U.S. grew nearly 6 percentage points in share total prescription exiting June, compared to the prior year. While Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance increased their leading market share in the same period, while class growth accelerated. These products along with other key growth products represented 54% of revenue in the core business this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 30 basis points to 79.3% in Q2. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven primarily by unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, gross margin as a percent of revenue grew 60 points this quarter. Total operating expenses grew 18% this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% as the base period in Q2 2020 included a meaningful reduction in direct-to-consumer marketing and customer-facing expenses as health care system closed. R&D expenses increased 20% driven by investment in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including pirtobrutinib, tirzepatide, donanemab and lebrikizumab. In Q2, we also invested approximately $85 million in COVID therapy\u2019s R&D bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $300 million year-to-date. Net of COVID-19 R&D investment, operating expense growth was 18% compared to Q2 of 2020, and 10% for the first half of the year.  Operating income increased 29% compared to Q2 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 29.4% for the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by revenue growth outpacing expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the second half of 2021. Other income and expense was income of $5 million this quarter, compared to expense of $57 million in Q2 2020, driven by income from European patent settlements for Alimta.  Our effective tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 350 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods were reduced by net discrete tax benefit, with the lower net discreet tax benefit reflected in the second quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 29% in Q2, and 22% year-to-date or 30% and 24%, respectively, in constant currency.  On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. And we are encouraged by the growth seen across most of our major geographies. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue, and the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking, the core business grew 8% in the U.S., up from 5% in Q1 on that same basis. These results were driven entirely by volume laid by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, with increased rebates to maintain excellent access and higher growth in lower net price segments, largely offset by lower utilization into 340B segment, changes for estimates to rebates and discounts, and to a lesser extent, modest list price increases. The year-to-date price decline of 3% in the U.S. is in line with our net price expectations for the full-year.  Specific to Taltz in the U.S., performance for the quarter was in line with the expectation we described on the Q1 earnings call. And we were pleased to see a return to net sales growth this quarter, as volume gains more than offset price decline. Taltz Q2 performance benefited from a favorable change to prior estimates for rebates and discounts, and COVID-19 related inventory destocking last year. Excluding these items, Taltz still returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter. We believe the net price decline for Taltz in the first half of 2021 represents the underlying full price trend, and that continued volume growth will drive net sales acceleration in the second half of the year. While midterm price trends are currently stable, given increasing variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business.  Moving to Europe, revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the negative impact of Q2 2020 COVID-19 related customer buying patterns, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, primarily for Trulicity, Taltz, Alimta and Olumiant. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth in the second half of this year, excluding the expected impact from the loss of exclusivity for Alimta. In Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency, driven primarily by the launches of Olumiant and Emgality. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by the decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. But our key growth products grew 21% in Q2 in Japan, and represented approximately 50% of the business there. Recent surges of COVID-19 cases continue to negatively impact recovery in Japan. So, we currently expect improved revenue growth in the second half of the year, based on the uptake of newer products. In China, revenue grew 106% in constant currency, primarily driven by the divestiture of Cialis and the launches of Tyvyt and Trulicity. Excluding the impact from the Cialis transaction, our revenue in China grew 35% in constant currency. We are excited about the continued momentum in China as sales of new medicines have accelerated significantly in the past 3 quarters. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate volume effect on revenue for our June year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies, except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 17 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.5 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 54% of our core business revenue in Q2. We're encouraged by the strength of our key products in Q2, collectively up over 34% compared to the same period last year. Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance, all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are now tracking above pre-COVID-19 new-to-brand prescription baseline in the U.S. across all major therapeutic areas, with the exception of oncology and the CGRP antibody class, which we expect will continue to recover in the second half of the year. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first half of 2021, we invested $5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of after-tax investments in R&D, business development and capital investments. In addition, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchase. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we will continue to fund our growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline and seek external innovation to augment our future prospects as well as returning capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. While the COVID-19 pandemic is still impacting countries around the world, the pace of recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectations in Q2. New-to-brand scripts in most of the classes in which we compete with are tracking above pre-COVID baseline in the U.S. and health care systems in most major markets are largely returning to normal as we enter the second half of 2021. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook for the core business by $200 million to reflect the strong performance and favorable impact from foreign exchange. We are, however, lowering the top end of the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue by $400 million and confirming the bottom end of that range. Moving forward, we expect COVID-19 antibody revenues to be less of a factor, as demonstrated by Q2 revenue declining to $150 million from $810 million in Q1. As variants are growing, we recognize the situations across the globe can evolve quickly and we plan to adapt as required. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged at approximately 79%. On a reported basis, we've lowered guidance for gross margin percent to approximately 75% to reflect the impact of COVID-19 antibodies' excess inventory charge due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from the U.S. and international government and near-term expiry of COVID-19 antibodies inventory. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. However, investment in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches could push us towards the top end of our guidance range for both R&D and SG&A. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 30%, driven by lower COVID-19 antibody revenue. However, it remains approximately 31%, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Our GAAP operating margin is now expected to be approximately 24%. We are increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $0 to $100 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlements in Europe I noted earlier. And our GAAP range is now income of $375 million to $475 million, which also reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our expected tax rate remains unchanged. And on a reported basis, we've lowered our expected tax rate to approximately 12%. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share remains unchanged at $7.80 to $8, while GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.73 to $6.93, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 antibody inventory charge, the impact of equity investment gains and the Alimta patent settlements in Europe. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. As we look at the underlying volume and share trends across our key growth products, we're confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first half of this year strengthen our conviction in our midterm and long-term outlook for continued top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. 2021 has clearly been a productive year for R&D at Lilly, with continued strong progress in our pipeline and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting several updates for our late-stage pipeline. I'll start with donanemab.  In Q2, the first amyloid lung agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway based on plaque lowering, which we believe reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer's drug approval in the U.S. Lilly has long been an advocate for using biomarkers for amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles to identify patients for treatment and to monitor their response to therapy. We were pleased to see the FDA's conclusion that improvements in brain pathology are appropriate surrogates for clinical efficacy of Alzheimer's drugs. Based on data we've seen to date, we believe donanemab clears plaque faster and deeper than previously seen with other therapies and achieved complete plaque clearance in a majority of patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ after only limited duration of dosing. On the basis of the clinical evidence for donanemab, we were pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference last week, we shared additional important analyses from donanemab TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Briefly, I'll highlight several findings. First, we shared detailed exploratory statistical analyses comparing a variety of methods beyond MMRM and DPM, as summarized on Slide 14. We are pleased to see that these new analyses showed consistency of effects on primary and secondary outcomes across all statistical methods. Notably, all of the new analyses conducted showed good separation of treatment from placebo with statistical significance achieved for most endpoints at nearly all relevant time points measured. The robustness of the treatment efficacy across analytical methods increases our confidence in the potential clinical benefit of donanemab. While all statistical methods evaluated showed similar results, we note that the Bayesian disease progression model, DPM, closely reflected the raw observed data with the smallest standard error of any method. These results reinforced our hypothesis that DPM is a preferred analytical method for Alzheimer's trials. Additionally, we shared new data showing a relationship of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline, as shown on Slide 15. To our knowledge, this is the first time such results have been available. When we initially reported the results of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we commented that at a group level, patients treated with donanemab showed both statistically better plaque reduction and statistically better slowing of cognitive decline at 18 months. But patient-level correlations between degree of plaque reduction and magnitude of slowing or cognitive decline were not significant. Now using a more sophisticated PK iADRS exploratory analysis that uses all of the available time course data, we showed a highly significant relationship between degree of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline with P less than 0.001.  The Conrado model, shown here, was published in 2014 and is the result of efforts from the Coalition Against Major Diseases, CAMD, which collected placebo data from 15 randomized trials, including almost 4,500 participants. We introduced a treatment arm and incorporated percent amyloid plaque removal into this model to generate these results. And we believe this is important support for the use of amyloid plaque reduction as a surrogate for clinical efficacy. Notably, these data suggests that full clearance of amyloid plaque is required for highest efficacy as model results predict that patients achieving a 100% clearance of amyloid plaque could have more than 40% slowing of disease progression. Moving to Slide 16. We show an exploratory analysis looking at the effect of donanemab's plaque clearance on development of tau pathology. Tau pathology is an exciting biomarker since measures of Alzheimer's disease tau, unlike measures of amyloid plaque, have been correlated with clinical measures of cognitive and functional decline as noted here. Importantly, we have previously shown that donanemab-treated patients had slower accumulation of regional brain tau pathology than placebo-treated patients. This is an important finding because the amount of brain tau pathology is an excellent predictor of subsequent cognitive decline, a finding we observed with solanezumab in EXPEDITION3 and reproduced once again in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Now we've extended these results to show that the donanemab-treated patients who achieved complete clearance of amyloid plaque by 6 months had the most marked slowing of tau spread with nearly complete abrogation of progression in the frontal lobe. This reinforces our hypothesis that both deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance are required for optimal drug efficacy. With this new data we presented last week, we have now linked degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of clinical benefit as well as degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of benefit on brain tau pathology, which is itself linked to clinical benefit. As displayed on Slide 17, we have just recently obtained data with our plasma tau biomarker, phospho-tau217. These new data demonstrate that amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab also resulted in reversal of the typical increases of phosphorylated tau seen in the blood with decreases from baseline of more than 24% and a change from the untreated arm with a P-value of less than 0.0001. This highly significant effect was seen as early as 3 months following initiation of treatment and could reflect a combination of less tau spread in the brain as well as less neuronal damage, which could account for tau leakage into the periphery. You can see on the right side of the slide that the effect on plasma tau is also correlated to a degree of plaque reduction with nearly every patient on treatment who achieved substantial plaque clearance showing flat or declining plasma phospho-tau. We are delighted to see the potential utility of P-tau217 not just for diagnosing disease, but also for monitoring treatment efficacy. We believe this could be another important contribution to the Alzheimer's field. Finally, on Slide 18, the significant relationship between plasma P-tau217 reduction and the slowing of cognitive decline is shown. This additional biomarker for efficacy links the donanemab mechanism of amyloid plaque clearance with positive effects on both clinical outcomes and tau pathology. These data suggest that patients who achieved a 30% decrease in P-tau217 from baseline showed more than 40% slowing of disease progression. The 3 main findings I just discussed. One, the consistency of clinical benefit across statistical methods; two, the correlation of plaque lowering the clinical benefit, the patients who achieved the greatest plaque clearance. I mean, the greatest opportunity for benefit; and three, the correlation between achieving complete plaque clearance and beneficial effects on tau pathology seen in the brain and measured in the periphery, which themselves are predictors for clinical benefit, strongly support the efficacy of donanemab and give us confidence that the remarkable levels of amyloid plaque clearance achieved by donanemab could translate into a meaningful breakthrough for patients. Moving to Slide 19. Accordingly, we've announced that we plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway before the end of this year based on data from completed studies, supplemented by additional safety data from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. We remain focused on enrolling TRAILBLAZER-2 with the aim to replicate the positive results of TRAILBLAZER-1. Replication is important to overcome skepticism in the field. We hope that TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 will generate important confirmatory data for patients, physicians and payers and help us understand how to make sure the right patient gets the right duration of therapy at the right stage of disease. We are pleased to announce today that we have closed screening for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, with an adequate number of subjects now in the trial's screening process to fully enroll the study. Given that conducting and processing and imaging studies used during screening take several weeks to complete, we expect that the final subject to complete screening procedures and receive their first dose of donanemab or placebo by the end of the third quarter and the study will complete 18 months later. Given this progress in enrollment, we are confident that we will achieve the number and duration of drug exposures needed to appropriately characterize the safety profile of donanemab, allowing for regulatory submission by the end of this year. Discussions with the FDA are consistent with our prior statement supporting a submission before the end of 2021. I also want to provide a few comments on how we believe the national coverage determination opened for monoclonal antibody therapies targeting amyloid by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may impact Lilly and donanemab. We believe this NCD is a clear opportunity to focus treatment on the patients most likely to benefit from amyloid plaque-reducing therapies. This would align with our goals, which have long been to use advanced diagnostic tools to identify the right patients that can benefit the most from amyloid-reducing therapies. We're particularly encouraged that our progress with the plasma P-tau217 assay could open up broader access to diagnostic tools. Still, despite the advances in diagnostics and the promise of donanemab, we acknowledge the current skepticism in the national discussion. And we hope that each drug will be evaluated by payers and prescribers based on its own data. This could be particularly important given the data I've shared today, which suggests that the degree of donanemab's amyloid plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit. In summary, we look forward to submitting donanemab to the FDA later this year with the potential to bring a robust amyloid plaque-clearing agent with limited treatment duration to market for early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients in 2022 with potential replicated clinical efficacy results expected in 2023. Transitioning now to Verzenio. On the last earnings call, we commented that FDA had asked to see an overall survival trend in favor of Verzenio in the monarchE trial in adjuvant breast cancer. We also noted that the OS data set is quite immature in the overall population, which makes interpretation challenging. We have now provided to the FDA additional data from the monarchE study, and we were encouraged to see continued strengthening of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival, IDFS, as well as consistent benefit in the key secondary endpoint of distant recurrence-free survival, DRFS. Of note, with this continued follow-up, we can now confirm this benefit extends beyond the 2-year Verzenio treatment period. We look forward to disclosing this new analysis at a medical meeting this fall. Our discussions with the FDA have focused on the prespecified subpopulation of patients with high Ki-67 index, a marker of increased cell proliferation. These patients have more aggressive disease and higher risk of relapse and thus are more mature for overall survival analysis. This group, which makes up approximately half of the monarchE population, are demonstrating an overall survival trend that favors the treatment arm. And based on FDA feedback, we expect an initial approval in adjuvant breast cancer in this population before the end of the year, in line with the current review cycle. Importantly, since the IDFS and DRFS hazard ratios favoring Verzenio are similar in patients with high and low Ki-67 index, we expect that the OS trend first seen in the Ki-67 high population will, in time, be replicated in the broader study population. We hope to expand the label to the entire enrolled population in the future once we see more overall survival events in the broader population. To date, regulators outside the U.S. have not raised the same questions on overall survival. Finally, moving to Olumiant. We shared in July that the FDA will not meet the PDUFA action date for the supplemental new drug application for atopic dermatitis. This delay is related to the FDA's ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. Patient safety is critical to Lilly, and we continue to further evaluate baricitinib's safety profile with ongoing randomized and observational safety studies. We're confident that the efficacy and safety data for baricitinib support a favorable benefit risk profile for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA during the remainder of the review process. We do not have additional information on timing or specific action date from the FDA, but we see potential for regulatory action for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. later this year. We're committed to bringing Olumiant to market in the U.S. to help meet the needs for people living with atopic dermatitis. Slide 20 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 30, and Slide 21 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several additional major developments since our last earnings call and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In May, we shared the positive results for tirzepatide in SURPASS-4 and announced that the SURPASS program met regulatory submission requirements for evaluating cardiovascular risk and confirmed our intention to submit a registration package for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to global regulatory authorities by the end of 2021. At ADA in June, tirzepatide was a large focus as we shared detailed data for the first 4 studies from the tirzepatide SURPASS program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These results support our belief that tirzepatide may represent a substantial improvement in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, with early and unsurpassed improvements in A1c and body weight reduction across doses. We remain on track for global regulatory submissions before the end of this year. We are also excited about tirzepatide's opportunity across multiple indications, including cardiovascular outcomes, obesity, NASH and heart failure. In Q2, we initiated SUMMIT, our planned Phase 3 study for tirzepatide in heart failure. In July, we achieved an important milestone with Jardiance as the first and only medicine to achieve a primary endpoint for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. The EMPEROR-Preserved Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated significant risk reduction with Jardiance for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with HFpEF. This is a significant breakthrough for patients, and we're proud of what we've achieved here in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim. We look forward to presenting detailed results from this study at the European Society of Cardiology on August 27, and we expect to submit this indication to regulators later this year. We also received approval in the EU for Jardiance HFrEF in June and expect regulatory action in the U.S. and Japan later this year for this indication. Additionally, we've advanced our GGG tri-agonist into Phase 2 for diabetes based on the promising data we shared at ADA, which supports the potential for differentiated efficacy from tirzepatide with respect to body weight while maintaining glycemic control. We also started 2 Phase 1 studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lastly, we removed one of our oral GIP/GLP Phase 1 molecules from our pipeline. In oncology, we also continue to make important progress. Starting with Verzenio, we've initiated 2 Phase 3 studies since our last update. As planned, we've initiated an adjuvant study for HR+ HER2 breast cancer. And we are announcing today that a result -- as a result of a favorable blinded interim analysis for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we've also initiated the Phase 3 portion of this adaptive study. This action was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC. The IDMC reviewed interim efficacy and safety data and concluded that the results met the prespecified expansion criteria based on radiographic progression-free survival and recommended advancing the study to the registrational Phase 3 stage. While Lilly remains blinded to the study, we are obviously very pleased with this development and have already begun dosing patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial. Given that the expansion of Phase 3 includes the cohort of patients who are in the Phase 2 study, these data remain blinded and we will not be disclosing these at medical meeting. On the development front in oncology, we also made progress with pirtobrutinib and our oral SERD. We've initiated the Phase 3 study for pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory MCL monotherapy, executing on our commitment to a robust Phase 3 program for this molecule. Regarding oral SERD, we announced our plans to begin a Phase 3 study later in 2021 based on the Phase 1 results we shared at ASCO in June that showed an efficacy and safety profile in line with our expectations. In addition, we've now achieved the first human dose for our next-generation KRAS G12C inhibitor. Lastly, in oncology, we announced that the FDA has accepted our submission of sintilimab for non-small cell lung cancer. This submission is an encouraging start for our collaborative efforts with Innovent to make sintilimab available in countries beyond China. In neurodegeneration, in addition to donanemab news I just shared, we anticipate a Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab later this year and note that our GBA1 gene therapy asset from PREVAIL started a Phase 2 study in type 2 Gaucher disease. For immunology, we do not have additional significant updates in Q2 but we're looking forward to the Phase 3 readouts of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis and baricitinib for lupus later this year. We also submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in Japan. Lastly, we're moving our COVID-19 antibody therapy, LY-CoV1404, now known as bebtelovimab, into Phase 2 to address viral variants as part of our ongoing commitment to help combat COVID-19, if needed. To recap, Q2 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, and we're excited about a number of further readouts and important milestones coming later this year, reflecting continued advances on behalf of patients suffering from disease. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks a lot, Dan. I appreciate that. Before we go to the Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during this quarter. We've seen strength in our core business in the first half of this year and increased momentum in Q2. This is driven by strong volume-driven growth across key brands in most major geographies. We're pleased to see sequential top line growth this quarter as well as year-over-year margin expansion. We made significant progress developing new medicines, and Q2 was another positive quarter for our pipeline as we announced plans to submit tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes and donanemab in Alzheimer's disease later this year as well as an approval for Jardiance in HFrEF, and as Dan outlined, positive results in HFpEF. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and completed $500 million in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are quite confident in our long-term prospects. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to share -- also like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to highlight our R&D pipeline and progress for investors. We will also provide our initial 2022 guidance at this meeting. Given the limited physical space available, this event will have an accompanying webcast. We're hopeful that we can host this event in person, but are watching the evolution of the pandemic closely and we'll adjust accordingly to a virtual event, if needed. Our IR team will be in contact in the coming weeks to issue invitations and provide more logistical details on this meeting. Now let me turn it over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session.\nKevin Hern : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Lois, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn : Maybe, Dan, I was just wondering if you could elaborate at all on your comments regarding your discussions with the FDA on donanemab. It sounds like they're consistent with your expectations. But any more color you can provide if they've actually signed off fully on your plans to file the BLA? And then how much additional safety data would they want to see from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-2 study?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Terence. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Sure, Terence. Thanks for that question on donanemab and FDA and safety. In June, when we got the Breakthrough Therapy designation and we announced our expectations to file the BLA by the end of the year, that was based on our current understanding of the situation. Since then, things have progressed and I would say I'm even more confident now than I was then, that we should have an adequate package to support a complete submission by the end of this year. That includes, of course, our confidence that we have enough safety data to support a full evaluation of the benefit/risk of this drug. I think given limited duration of dosing, that helps as well as given the near completion now of enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-2. So it's our intent then to use combined safety data from the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies as well as an early look at safety data from that ongoing Phase 3 study to support the package. Now of course, with any ongoing study, there's always risk. We don't know what that safety data is going to show. If it's consistent with safety data we've collected prior to the study, then I think we should also be confident that, that would support a positive benefit/risk assessment and put us on track to launch next year, as we said.\nOperator: And the next question is from Ronny Gal from Bernstein.\nAaron Gal : Two, the first one, I'll stay with donanemab. You have kind of suggested in your comments there that there will be a good chance to use some of the biomarkers that you are developing in the early commercial use of donanemab. Can you talk a little bit about what markets do you expect to have proved by when? And how do you see the -- essentially, the entire patient passage through the use of donanemab going forward? And how does it differ from other amyloid \u03b2? And second, Basaglar seems to have a bit of a price drop this quarter. Can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing here? What are you expecting with the approval of the first interchangeable biosimilars? Any impact there? And as we go forward, how should we think about that franchise?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Dan for the questions on donanemab, and then Mike Mason for the questions on Basaglar.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Ronny, for the question on biomarkers and their commercial use. Of course, this has been an area of great progress and great investment by Lilly. We continue to put a lot of emphasis here. I think objectively, you wouldn't have had the progress that we're seeing now in Alzheimer's disease had it not been for the ability to select patients for treatment and follow their response treatment with biomarkers. We don't see that as a research-only application. That should be available, those kinds of tools, to patients in the clinical -- who are being clinically treated for Alzheimer's disease in the future. So the status of the tools right now is both of the PET agents, the tau PET imaging with Tauvid that we use in the amyloid PET imaging with Amyvid. Those are both, of course, FDA approved and availability is somewhat limited right now, particularly for Tauvid, but could quickly be scaled with the launch of donanemab in the future. The third agent, which is probably the one that will be the most accessible to patients is the phospho-tau217 assay. Just as we continue to work on that assay, we're more and more impressed with its performance, its ability to identify patients, and even as I've shown today, track their progression. So this could be an answer for patients in the near term. We'll work hard to make that available. The bar is often lower for in vitro diagnostics and in vivo diagnostics. And I think there's good potential there. You asked about the patient flow once all these things are approved and available and presumably, that happens around the time that donanemab launched but not before. I think it would make sense and fit with medical practice if screening starts with some sort of simple cognitive exams by a physician to assess the patient's eligibility to early Alzheimer's, then they would move on to probably a blood-based test like phospho-tau217. If that's positive, that could either be a basis for treatment depending on if data support that or that could triage patients to PET scans for further evaluation.\nKevin Hern : Thanks, Dan. Now to Mike for the questions around Basaglar Q2 performance and Semglee interchangeability.\nMichael Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question on Basaglar. The performance that you're seeing in the second quarter of '21 has primarily been driven by pricing pressure and volume pressure in the Medicaid segment for Basaglar. Let me give you a little bit of color on how the Medicaid segment works. There's really 2 different types of states: those that have one signal unified preferred drug list across managed Medicaid and fee-for-service; and then others that have 2 different kind of unique preferred drug list across fee-for-service and a different one for managed Medicaid. What we've seen with Basaglar is when states decide to transition from having 2 preferred drug list to a unified preferred drug list, the economics for the state tends to favor the long-standing brands like Lantus. And so at that point, you see if we have one estate for -- in a managed Medicaid, you'll see the transition back to Lantus. So that's what you've seen driving our Q2 performance. Also in the managed Medicaid space, we have seen some pricing pressure there from Semglee that has required us to put more rebates on the -- in order to preserve volume for that. Now let me turn to kind of -- well, first of all, before turning to Semglee, know that the trends for Basaglar are fully baked into our guidance for the remaining part of 2021. Now let me turn to Semglee. First of all, understand that Semglee has gained interchangeability just with Lantus, not with Basaglar. So we don't anticipate any immediate impact on Basaglar. If you look at Semglee performance to date, they've captured about 2% share of market on the TRx and about 1% of new treatment starts. And the vast majority of that has come from Medicare Part A, which is hospitals, and the Medicaid segment. If you look at the price point for Semglee, it's currently at $99 per vial and about $150 for 5 pack of pens.  And with the move to interchangeability, we really support any actions that help patients with diabetes have more affordable out-of-pocket experience, which is why anyone, regardless of insurance status, is eligible to buy their monthly prescription of Lilly insulin for $35 or less through our Insulin Value Program. The Insulin Value Program has helped lower the average out-of-pocket costs for a monthly prescription of Lilly insulin, which also requires -- or includes multiple vials or insulin pen packs to $28.05 in the face of raising health insurance deductibles. So it's great that people living with diabetes has access to many options to lower their out-of-pocket costs. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And the next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson : A couple of questions. Just your general thoughts on subcu dosing with antibodies to plaque, does that offer meaningful differentiation? At a high level, the benefits would seem quite obvious to being able to dose a drug at home. But some argue that it falls outside of a Medicare Part B framework, so maybe docs would be more inclined to stick with an infusion. And I believe you originally did not pursue subcu because you're worried you wouldn't get enough drug across the blood brain barrier. Roche has shown us that they can achieve that. So can we expect Lilly might also pursue a subcu? And would this require a formal Phase 3 study looking at plaque reduction as a primary endpoint? And then last quick question, why wouldn't something like P-tau217 become a separate meaningful revenue stream in its own right for Lilly?\nKevin Hern : Thanks, Tim. We'll go to Dan for all those questions.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Thanks. No, it's a good question and line of questions here on subcu dosing for anti-amyloid therapies. Probably 2 factors that we have taken into account in addition to the ones you mentioned. First and most important is efficacy for patients. And I think all of the data that we have so far suggest and support the notion that deep and rapid clearance is key here. And so if you're going to go to subcu dosing, it's important to make sure you do get enough drug in so that you can quickly get patients to clear. That's not going to always be possible with every drug. I think the second consideration with subcu dosing is the duration of therapy. So if it's a limited duration of therapy, the difference between IV and subcu, if it's once a month for 6 months, that's not a big difference between IV and subcu. Whereas if it's for the rest of your life, maybe that is a bigger difference. Finally, with respect to our plans for subcu, I do think it's an important option to offer patients, notwithstanding the previous comments, even for a limited duration therapy, some patients may prefer it, assuming you can get the same kind of efficacy. I think with donanemab, that's unlikely to be possible, and we're not pursuing it given the doses we need and the formulation we have. However, we have a second-generation antibody here that we call N3pG4, which I think is quite likely to be viable in a subcutaneous presentation. And that is our focus of development around N3pG4. My expectation around that is that it should be able to show comparable amyloid plaque lowering with subcutaneous dosing as donanemab does with IV dosing. If so, given the similarities between the drugs, we would seek an accelerated approval pathway for that drug in the future as sort of a subcutaneous version of donanemab, although it is a new enemy. Your second question was around the phospho-tau assay and whether that's a significant revenue stream. It's certainly conceivable and we haven't sort of thought through all of our commercial plans around that. But really for Lilly, and it may be significant for some companies, I think for Lilly, though, our focus is on removing barriers for treatment to patients. And so as we think about how we position diagnostics and therapeutics in the marketplace, our focus will be on really making sure that most patients possible can get treated appropriately.\nDavid Ricks : And maybe just a comment -- thanks, Dan, Tim, on the access and payment environment, I think our priority at Lilly is always going to be how to make it easier for patients to get to a therapy and then we solve for value on the back end. There are clearly benefits in the short-duration treatment, like Dan said, with donanemab in a Part B. They're going to be watched closely by their physicians initially anyway. There are real and important side effects, which require imaging analysis for this class of drugs. And so it's an intensively managed disease. But through time, as we've seen with other classes, as comfort level will rise in primary care, in particular, in using therapeutic antibodies to treat Alzheimer's, a more convenient form available at our local pharmacy, perhaps for self-injection or injection by a caregiver, would be preferred. So our plans line up with -- in pursuing both those channels, although in early days, probably the intensive nature of the treatment and specialist nature will favor the infusion. But we're committed to both, and we're solving for patient convenience at the end of the day.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Just one on donanemab and then one on Verzenio. Just I guess my bigger question on donanemab is, how are you thinking about the role of A\u03b2 antibodies maybe prior to definitive cognition data being available? So I guess do you see cognition data significantly expanding the market opportunity for these products? Or do you anticipate we're going to see broad usage, even in the event, let's just say, the additional cognitive readouts you see on donanemab were less definitive than what we saw in the Phase 2? I'm just trying to say, do you think the whole market at this point is just going to move to plaque regression or reduction or at least cognition is still very important, I think, in terms of the commercial opportunity? My second question was on the Verzenio update. I just -- just a 2-parter here. Just when do you think you'll have that incremental OS data for the other 50% of the population? And how hard is it to identify these higher-risk patients as we think about maybe the initial commercial opportunity in adjuvant?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Dan for donanemab, and then Anne for the questions on Verzenio.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. So your question is -- maybe I'll break it in two parts. The first part is like how important is in the near term to have additional cognitive benefit data for amyloid plaque [lung] drugs. And then in the longer term, what happens if the confirmatory studies give a negative surprise. So in the short term, I'd just clarify that we have compelling clinical efficacy data for donanemab. The only trial that's going to be successful, a positive Phase II study and its primary endpoint showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, that's different, unique and exciting, published in the New England Journal, that's exciting. And I think that will be helpful even before we have the confirmatory data, being in that unique position. There will be some physicians, I'm sure, as are today, who still say, I don't want to use a drug until I have cognitive data. Fine, for those physicians who are willing to make that link between the surrogate efficacy data and the Phase II data in donanemab, if you believe that lowering amyloid plaque is the good thing to do, you're going to want the drug that lowers amyloid plaque the most. And I think that's an exciting aspect of donanemab as well. But then we come to the confirmatory studies. I think surely everyone have to acknowledge if for multiple sponsors, multiple drugs are all clearly negative, that would be a bad thing and we would retreat and say that this was a wrong way of thinking. I think that scenario is extremely unlikely. I think the most likely scenario is probably a mixed picture. Some drugs will be better than others. Some trials will reach significance, others might not. You've heard me speak about the confidence in our trial, but we have to see the data. I think in that scenario, that will strengthen -- that would be good enough to reinforce the notion that amyloid is an important surrogate and reducing amyloid is a good idea.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anne, on Verzenio?\nAnne White: Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. And as Dan shared, we are incredibly pleased with what we're seeing out of Verzenio and the monarchE data and as he shared key endpoints, such as IDFS have continued to strengthen with further follow-up. And now we have two years of median follow-up. And so very pleased with that, and as he shared, we remain very confident there will be an OS trend favoring Verzenio in the broader population. So we would work with the FDA to expand our label to include these patients in the future. So obviously, this is event driven and so the timing of this will be determined by the event rate. So our next planned analysis is in the second half of '22, and this analysis will help us really further inform the timing of that final analysis. So as you commented, the overall survival data in the broader population is still immature. We still have less than 50% of the events needed to do that final OS analysis. But with what we're seeing, and again, strong performance in both the high and low Ki67, we remain confident to see this trend in OS favoring Verzenio to replicate. As far as Ki67, good news here is that this is really a familiar concept to physicians. It is already accepted as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. And it's really easily performed through an IHC assay, so very simple assay. And these are broadly available in the pathology labs. And the assay and the methodology that we used on monarchE is straightforward and proven to be accurate and really highly reproducible. So our belief is that oncologists will move to quickly adopt this in practice. And really, this clarity in patients with the highest risk, I think, will help to accelerate uptake in this setting. So we look forward to launching in this setting.\nOperator: The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. Surprisingly, I also want to talk about Alzheimer's today. Dan, I have three subparts. First, are you expecting to use interim data from your ongoing Phase III as part of the regulatory filing or during the review? Secondly, once the plaque is cleared, and I think 60% of patients have clearance by 12 months, what rate of onset of new amyloid plaque do you expect subsequently? And I'm just trying to understand your expectation on finite duration of dosing versus Biogen's opinion on continued dosing. And then finally, I'm also trying to reconcile the slide you showed on the nonlinear model, the Conrado model, suggesting a relationship between plaque decrease and a slowing in clinical progression. Are you saying there's a relationship? Or are you saying there's a causality? Because you might recall the New England Journal paper on your Phase II mentioned there was no association between plaque and clinical benefit at patient level 1, Biogen data suggested similar. Thank you very much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Umer. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Three great questions, Umer. Thanks. So the first question, you asked if we'd use interim data, I commented that we'll take a safety cut of data in the right way to support that submission. We don't plan to support that submission or do we see the need to support that submission with any looks at efficacy data. We have adequate efficacy data supporting the plaque lowering, which would be the basis of submission and approval under accelerated approval. Your second question is once plaque clears, how long does it take to come back? We have some data on that that was also presented at AAIC. I didn't highlight it this morning. But what we found is that off therapy, there is very slow, negligible, really, regrowth of plaque. I think if you sort of extrapolate it out, it might take 14 or 15 years or something like that to regrow amyloid plaque. The average age of patients in this trial is 75. And remember, we haven't fully halted progression of disease. So that doesn't feel like a near-term thinking on redosing will be necessary to keep them clear. But we'll have the ability to follow patients for many, many years and confirm that. Finally, I think you've correctly summarized the situation, which is that in our initial analysis, we didn't see a correlation and now we are reporting that we do see a correlation. Why is that? And of course, correlation can't prove causation so it is just a correlation. So why do we see it now? I think what we learned was quite interesting. And that's that the amount of plaque you remove depends a lot on how much plaque you have to start with. So if you only have 50 centiloids of plaque, there's only so much you can remove. If you have 100 centiloids of plaque based on, you can remove a lot more. So that turns out to be a pretty important compound in these kinds of correlations. The people who are -- have the more severe disease, perhaps longer duration, lower cognitive performance, older age, they might have more plaque at baseline, you can remove more but they still might be the worst progressors than people who have lower plaque and you remove less. So, I think our thinking initially, and maybe the field thinking, was a little bit backwards on this to look for a straight correlation between change and change without adjusting for all of those important baseline covariance.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Andrew Baum. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions please. Just going back to interim analysis for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ to not so much as used to support accelerated but to accelerate the readout for the full standard regulatory review, you're using a Bayesian disease progression model. Given that you're getting such a rapid clearance of Alzheimer's and that's linked to cognition in those patients who have that, do we have to assume that the follow-up is going to go out to the full 72 weeks? Or is there a possibility of early unblinding driven by efficacy in these patients? And then second, perhaps you could comment on the manufacturing capacity for donanemab as well as the regulatory outlook for your P-tau assay, assuming that you attain regulatory approval on the accelerators. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. Dan, we'll go to you for those questions.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. So Andrew, you've asked a follow-up question here, an important one, on the potential even in the face of an accelerated review for accelerated approval, rather, for plaque lowering, whether we'd still be keen to get that kind of data a bit earlier by pulling forward an interim on TRAILBLAZER-2. We haven't ruled that out. We also don't have plans at this moment in time. I think we just need to see where we are and where the field is. But really, the -- maintaining a pristine Phase III trial would probably be a pretty high priority, particularly if accelerated approval gives the path for patients to have access to the medicine, then it becomes less urgent to get that data faster. So that's our current thinking. We've been working hard to make sure we have manufacturing capacity. I feel good about where we are to support launch and growth of donanemab and hopefully someday enter PG4 even to follow that. With respect to the commercialization of a P-tau diagnostic, there are different paths forward for an in vitro diagnostic, including a lab-developed test, or LDT, which can be done in a centralized location, for example, under CLIA. And that's a pretty fast path and that's one of the options that we consider.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first question I had for you is, how do you think about a potential outcome for the national coverage determination of monoclonal antibodies to treat Alzheimer's disease? And then second question is, how would you think about pricing donanemab if it is approved? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Louise. Dan?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Thanks. Two sort of commercially focused questions on donanemab. I mean the first one on the national coverage decision, determination -- of course, that's important. When -- I think it was widely said that when the first approval came, it was quite broad an indication and then subsequently, the FDA working with the sponsor focused the patient population. I think there could still be opportunity for further focusing here. And that's one direction the experts at CMS may take. In that case, it could be requiring patients to have evidence of Alzheimer's pathology in the form of amyloid plaques or even tau pathology. As I said before, I think that matches our goals and what we think is right. It will take some time for that to play out probably over the next nine months or so and surely will be part of some of those discussions and share our data and thinking in the right way. And then on pricing, I think I simply say it's too early to comment on that. We have some time yet.\nOperator: The next call is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Dan, you're popular today, so I just have a couple more for you. On donanemab, is there a hurdle that FDA has provided in terms of number of patients for safety, either for the filing or during the review? And then as the data from TRAILBLAZER matures, what is your estimate on what the duration of therapy benefit could ultimately be? And then real quick on tirzepatide. Just wanted to know as you guys complete the filing. At this point, what's the gating factor as you look at the different geographies and you prepare?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Jeff, we'll go to Dan for the donanemab questions, and then Mike Mason on tirzepatide.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. So with respect to the safety hurdle for donanemab or for any drug, really, it's having adequate exposures and duration of exposures in a broad population to be able to fully assess the benefit risk of a given drug. Now that's not a number that depends on the particulars of the drug, the population, of course, that you hope to treat the duration of therapy, of course, but also the particulars around the safety data and the efficacy data that you collect. So it would be nice and easy, I think, for sponsors and the FDA if there was a particular line in the sand that could be drawn. But as I said, it needs to be tailored for each drug. Based on our current thinking and analysis and discussions, as I said, I think we'll be there comfortably at the end of this year. Your second question was about -- I think it was about the duration of benefit as the TRAILBLAZER data mature. I commented on the duration of plaque lowering, which appears to be sustained. But I think, Geoff, you're getting at the duration of the cognitive benefit. We see a slowing of decline on average between that patients are still declining. You could ask, are the lines coming together or going apart? I think on some of the cuts to the initial data, there might have been a perception that the lines were not diverging at the later time points, I think, as I showed the additional statistical methods. And even as we look at the raw data, we're pretty comfortable here that we have lines that diverge over time. And therefore, I would expect that, that benefit of slowing would continue over time. But too soon to have real data on that.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Mike, on tirzepatide?\nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. Our Phase III SURPASS program for type 2 diabetes is done and completed. So the only gating factor here is how quickly we can summarize the data and submit to the regulators, which we plan to do by the end of the year to major global regulators.\nOperator: And the next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Maybe I guess I'll try to take another stab at the pricing question. I appreciate it's early, but it is sort of the elephant in the room. And just maybe if Dave and team could comment just on the appropriateness of the pricing benchmarks in the space already today in Alzheimer's, as you think about it. And then obviously, 3Q has tripped in the past around Trulicity dynamics. So just hoping, if you could just offer a little bit more clarity there on as you think about pricing headwinds into 3Q specifically? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Carter. So we'll go to Dave for the question on pricing for donanemab, and then Mike on Trulicity pricing dynamics.\nDavid Ricks: Yes. I appreciate the question, and we totally get the curiosity. There's, as you understand, probably lot of limitations of what we would say at this stage. One of the reasons for the limitation is really the ultimate label we have and the value we can demonstrate to customers is a key input at Lilly for pricing. And we have -- fortunately, the only study in the space that hit its pre-specified endpoint for disease reduction -- or disease progression reduction, and those are key. As we demonstrated at AAIC, we continue to cut that data. I think there was an earlier question about how we might differentiate in the NCD process, but that's one of them as we have this completed study with exquisite biomarker profiles of the product and can continue to elucidate what donanemab does in the brains of Alzheimer's patients in ways that perhaps others could not. And those are inputs as well. Finally, Lilly has been a leader in value-based concepts and really partnerships to make sure that the appropriate patients can easily access at low out-of-pocket cost or medicines. And we're applying that thinking to this problem as well in the U.S. as well as outside. Our goal isn't to just get an approval, but to make sure that all of the people millions in the U.S. who could qualify for it could access it on day one. So those are all inputs into that process and without throwing out a number here, which wouldn't be appropriate until we get an approval. That's how we think about it. Hopefully, that gives you some color behind the scenes.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. And then to Mike on Trulicity for pricing dynamics, pricing trends.\nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question, really nothing new to report on Trulicity pricing. At the beginning of the year, we gave guidance that when you take a look at the impact of increased rates and market, second mix and offset by lower utilization, 340B and modest list price increases, that for the year, we would see low single-digit price decline for Trulicity. That's what we're experiencing, so really nothing new to update at this point in the year.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Yes. Let me just add just more general comment on pricing movement through the year, and I know we've had numerous conversations on this. And it does -- there does tend to be some volatility throughout the year. We do tend to see as patient flow through the health care system, more pronounced impact from the coverage gap in the second and third quarter of the year. So you see that dynamic throughout every -- really every year, as Mike said. And we built those assumptions into our full year guidance in terms of pricing dynamics for the year. And obviously, as we have more color and insight, we'll provide that. But right now, as we look at the full year estimate for U.S. pricing dynamic, it's consistent with what we previously discussed in terms of overall erosion. You saw 3% for the first half of the year, which is what you should expect for the full year.\nOperator: The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. So really wanted to kind of focus in on abemaciclib in prostate cancer and the update that was provided, I think in an abstract published at AACR, some of the details were provided with regard to the sort of threshold for moving forward as it relates to the hazard ratio. And it cites a hazard ratio of 0.64, 80% power. So with a P-value of 0.1 to, I think, continue advancing into the next stage of CYCLONE 2. So just wanted to clarify if that information is consistent and a driving force for moving forward, that would seem like a robust piece of information to have as we head into that. And then as incremental to that, just wanted to get a sense of the magnitude of the opportunity that Lilly believes this would represent for Verzenio going forward. And if there are, let's say, RB, so the retinoblastoma-related requirements for enrollment or any other biomarker requirements that could limit the size of the patient population. And then just as a follow-up. In terms of the NCD determination, just wanted to clarify if the pricing of the initially priced product would have any impact on Lilly's ability to independently price its own product, and if that's part of the reason why Lilly has argued for the products being treated independently as part of the NCD rather than as a class.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We're going to toss it to Dan first to start on Verzenio, and then Anne will follow to round that out, and then we'll go back to Dan for the NCD question.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. You're asking, Seamus, very smartly about the criteria to expand the study from our Phase II study to a Phase III study. I don't think we want to get into the very precise details on what that was. But you're correct that it was a very robust threshold. So we're excited to see that happen. We take Phase III starts very seriously at Lilly. We don't want Phase III failures. So when we have studies like this one, in any therapeutic area where we move from Phase II to Phase III without ever seeing the data, we set aggressive bars that data really have to match to move forward to Phase III. So you can expect that's what we did here. Anne for more detail.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anne, for more detail there and also the magnitude of the opportunity we see in prostate?\nAnne White: Yes. I mean, as Dan said, we were incredibly pleased with this outcome and the recommendation by the DMC, and we set a very aggressive threshold on this adaptive design, and we're impressed that it met that threshold. And I think it just continues to be another example of how Verzenio differentiates from the competition. So the Phase III is open. It's already enrolling patients. We anticipate the results of the analysis in 2024. On the question on market size, so CYCLONE 2 is -- it's a metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer trial that really targets patients who have not yet received prior novel hormonal agent, so in earlier settings. So our initial research shows that the addressable market could be in the range of 25% to 50% of metastatic CRPC. So it's depending really a bit on how the market evolves with the use of NHAs in that earlier setting. So in the U.S., for example, based on that, we currently estimate between 7,000 and 14,000 patients would match that inclusion criteria for CYCLONE 2. And exciting in this space is that as long as being a high unmet need in a large patient population, there's also a long length of anticipated treatment duration. So this could be a treatment duration of up to two years or longer. So that's why we're particularly excited about this opportunity, is what it delivers there. There is no RB or other biomarker requirements in the study.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Dan, on NCD?\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Last question was on NCD and why did I say that we think we -- each drug should be evaluated on its own merits. Is that an allusion to pricing or something like that? No, my primary focus here is on the patient and the outcomes that a drug could deliver, which, even within the same class, could be different. Our theory and I presented data today to support that theory, is that the amount of amyloid you remove and how quickly you do that is important for predicting outcomes. If that's the case, you can easily imagine different drugs, even with the same class having different benefits for patients and some of those benefits may be above a threshold for coverage and others may not. That's conceivable. Not what I anticipate is the most likely scenario, but we want to be prepared for all scenarios here.\nOperator: The next question is from Vamil Divan from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: Thanks for all the updates on the pipeline. So maybe a couple sort of separate topics that have been covered more on the call. So for one on lebrikizumab, clearly that one maybe gets underappreciated a little bit. We got Phase III data coming up. Can you maybe just set some expectations and what you're hoping to see? I know you have a dosing advantage potentially with that product, but obviously, dupi's a pretty formidable competitor there. So maybe you can just sort of frame what you're hoping to see. And then tirzepatide, just one quick follow-up. I know you mentioned you started, I think you said, the HFpEF study for that product. Are you looking at that for HFrEF as well? I just -- I don't remember you mentioning that. And if not, I'm just curious why you wouldn't pursue that.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Ilya for the question on lebrikizumab, and then Mike for tirzepatide.\nIlya Yuffa: Great. Thank you for the question on lebrikizumab. We're excited to -- for the second half of the year to see the data related to our induction phase for lebrikizumab across a number of trials. And so what we're hoping to see and expect to see is replicating some of the positive signals we saw in Phase II, where we have strong efficacy in skin itch, and we believe have a very good safety profile. And so we anticipate that lebrikizumab will have a very competitive profile versus DUPIXENT in a growing and a significant unmet need. And we see lebrikizumab being an important asset for us as we think about not only atopic dermatitis, but our overall presence and strength in dermatology and our growing immunology franchise.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ilya. Mike?\nMike Mason: Okay. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have only announced a HFpEF study for tirzepatide, and that's currently all we're planning on announcing at this point. I think we're very confident in the opportunity of tirzepatide in the HFpEF. When you look at patients that have HFpEF, there's a large segment that also are obese and obesity is a [steep] phenotype within this patient population. So I think we feel good about our -- the results we've seen in our Phase II studies that give us, I think, confidence that we'll be successful in HFpEF. And so right now, our efforts are focused on HFpEF.\nOperator: The next caller is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Two questions. First, on the Q1 earnings call, Lilly said in monarchE, there had been 76 events, 39 on abemaciclib, 37 on control. Can you provide an update with numbers on a like-for-like basis? And then secondly, on your oral SERD, did Lilly see potential for differentiation in the ASCO data? And if so, what differentiation did it see, particularly as competitor data and news flow evolves? Lilly has previously said, it would not pursue a me-too SERD. So I'm wondering what is different about yours.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Anne for the first question on Verzenio, and then Jake for the question on oral SERD differentiation.\nAnne White: Well, thanks, Steve. And as Dan shared, we're going to be presenting data from this recent analysis at a medical meeting later this year. So we won't be able to share further details and then, obviously, due to the embargo. But as you can tell, we are very pleased to see the data continue to strengthen in this latest analysis with more than two years of follow-up. As we stated previously, the overall survival data remains immature. So at this point, what I can share is we have less than half of the events needed, so less than 50% of the events needed for the prespecified OS analysis. So the data remains immature. Again, we were really pleased, even with that immaturity, to see that the patients with highest risk already had this favorable trend. But thanks for the question and look forward to sharing more at a meeting later on.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ann. Jake?\nJake Van Naarden: Sure, happy to take the question on SERD. We're pleased with how the drug is performing clinically. It's doing everything that we expected it to do from a pharmacology safety and efficacy perspective. I think the data package that we presented at ASCO and that which we continue to see in the trial subsequent to ASCO, placed the drug in a vacuum on par with the best agents in development from our peers. But this is not a class of medicine that stands on its own period. This is really a development program. And I think as it relates to me-tooism, what I would say is that we're not interested in pursuing a me-too development program, and we stand by that statement. And frankly, our leadership position in breast cancer, in particular, with emerging Verzenio data as we've been talking about today, I think, put us in a unique position as it relates to this class of medicines. That all having been said, I also think we are a bit more cautious about the long-term role of SERDs in this landscape, and we're looking forward to some randomized data for the first time from some of our competitors later this year that I think will shed some light on where these drugs ought to fit in the overall treatment paradigm.\nOperator: And that comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Harrison: Great. I guess two for me. So first, just a follow-up with two parts on the Conrado model, one, do you know regulators view of this model? And then secondly, maybe if you can just explain what we're seeing in a little bit more detail, it looks like you're seeing about a 40% regression, slowing at 100% clearance. I assume this is over 18 months. Would you expect that to continue to compound? I'm just wondering why only sort of 40% slowing when you've cleared all the plaque. And then just a second follow-up on SERD, any plans to look at that in combination with CDK4/6 or other combinations?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Matthew. We'll go to Dan for the questions on the Conrado model, and then Jake on SERD.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Matthew, for the question there. No, we don't have a regulator's view on the Conrado model. But we're encouraged that this model was built, as I said earlier, by the CAMD -- by data from the CAMD consortium and has been around for a while and used for various applications. What we're doing here, though, to be clear, is checking a patient's progression against what we predict their progression would be. So knowing all of their baseline factors, how much would the predicted to have progressed had they not been on drug versus how much did they actually progress. And so that's essentially what you're seeing in the graph. You're right, even with full plaque clearance, there's still some progression. There's only a 40% decrease. Now that's as big an effect as anyone ever has talked about in Alzheimer's disease, but surely, over time, we're going to need additional therapeutics for Alzheimer's beyond just clearing the plaque, at least in this stage of disease. And I think that's probably where tau therapeutics come into play. So that's how we think about it. I think earlier in the disease course, it could be quite different. Perhaps if you get it early enough, you could have 100% disease slowing in progression and in essence, no Alzheimer's, but that is yet to be proven.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Going to Jake for that question on SERD?\nJake Van Naarden: Yes, a question on SERD. Of course, we plan to explore combining our oral SERD with CDK4/6, in particular, with abemaciclib. We're doing that right now in the context of an expansion cohort of the Phase I/II trial, the same trial for which we presented data at ASCO has expansion cohorts that contemplate rational combinations, including with abemaciclib.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Jake. Matthew, thanks for your questions, and we've exhausted the queue. We'll go to Dave for the close.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. Thanks to Dan for answering all those questions. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in the Company, of course. We continue to see growth with our broad commercial portfolio. And we have strong momentum across our core business supported by a breadth of brands and accelerating classes and robust growth across U.S., Europe and China. In addition, as you heard today, we believe we have a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities, and we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with Investor Relations team if you have any questions we have not addressed today, and hope you have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dr. Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. 2021 has clearly been a productive year for R&D at Lilly, with continued strong progress in our pipeline and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting several updates for our late-stage pipeline. I'll start with donanemab.  In Q2, the first amyloid lung agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease was approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway based on plaque lowering, which we believe reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer's drug approval in the U.S. Lilly has long been an advocate for using biomarkers for amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles to identify patients for treatment and to monitor their response to therapy. We were pleased to see the FDA's conclusion that improvements in brain pathology are appropriate surrogates for clinical efficacy of Alzheimer's drugs. Based on data we've seen to date, we believe donanemab clears plaque faster and deeper than previously seen with other therapies and achieved complete plaque clearance in a majority of patients in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ after only limited duration of dosing. On the basis of the clinical evidence for donanemab, we were pleased to have received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference last week, we shared additional important analyses from donanemab TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Briefly, I'll highlight several findings. First, we shared detailed exploratory statistical analyses comparing a variety of methods beyond MMRM and DPM, as summarized on Slide 14. We are pleased to see that these new analyses showed consistency of effects on primary and secondary outcomes across all statistical methods. Notably, all of the new analyses conducted showed good separation of treatment from placebo with statistical significance achieved for most endpoints at nearly all relevant time points measured. The robustness of the treatment efficacy across analytical methods increases our confidence in the potential clinical benefit of donanemab. While all statistical methods evaluated showed similar results, we note that the Bayesian disease progression model, DPM, closely reflected the raw observed data with the smallest standard error of any method. These results reinforced our hypothesis that DPM is a preferred analytical method for Alzheimer's trials. Additionally, we shared new data showing a relationship of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline, as shown on Slide 15. To our knowledge, this is the first time such results have been available. When we initially reported the results of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we commented that at a group level, patients treated with donanemab showed both statistically better plaque reduction and statistically better slowing of cognitive decline at 18 months. But patient-level correlations between degree of plaque reduction and magnitude of slowing or cognitive decline were not significant. Now using a more sophisticated PK iADRS exploratory analysis that uses all of the available time course data, we showed a highly significant relationship between degree of amyloid plaque reduction and slowing of cognitive decline with P less than 0.001.  The Conrado model, shown here, was published in 2014 and is the result of efforts from the Coalition Against Major Diseases, CAMD, which collected placebo data from 15 randomized trials, including almost 4,500 participants. We introduced a treatment arm and incorporated percent amyloid plaque removal into this model to generate these results. And we believe this is important support for the use of amyloid plaque reduction as a surrogate for clinical efficacy. Notably, these data suggests that full clearance of amyloid plaque is required for highest efficacy as model results predict that patients achieving a 100% clearance of amyloid plaque could have more than 40% slowing of disease progression. Moving to Slide 16. We show an exploratory analysis looking at the effect of donanemab's plaque clearance on development of tau pathology. Tau pathology is an exciting biomarker since measures of Alzheimer's disease tau, unlike measures of amyloid plaque, have been correlated with clinical measures of cognitive and functional decline as noted here. Importantly, we have previously shown that donanemab-treated patients had slower accumulation of regional brain tau pathology than placebo-treated patients. This is an important finding because the amount of brain tau pathology is an excellent predictor of subsequent cognitive decline, a finding we observed with solanezumab in EXPEDITION3 and reproduced once again in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ. Now we've extended these results to show that the donanemab-treated patients who achieved complete clearance of amyloid plaque by 6 months had the most marked slowing of tau spread with nearly complete abrogation of progression in the frontal lobe. This reinforces our hypothesis that both deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance are required for optimal drug efficacy. With this new data we presented last week, we have now linked degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of clinical benefit as well as degree of amyloid plaque reduction with degree of benefit on brain tau pathology, which is itself linked to clinical benefit. As displayed on Slide 17, we have just recently obtained data with our plasma tau biomarker, phospho-tau217. These new data demonstrate that amyloid plaque clearance with donanemab also resulted in reversal of the typical increases of phosphorylated tau seen in the blood with decreases from baseline of more than 24% and a change from the untreated arm with a P-value of less than 0.0001. This highly significant effect was seen as early as 3 months following initiation of treatment and could reflect a combination of less tau spread in the brain as well as less neuronal damage, which could account for tau leakage into the periphery. You can see on the right side of the slide that the effect on plasma tau is also correlated to a degree of plaque reduction with nearly every patient on treatment who achieved substantial plaque clearance showing flat or declining plasma phospho-tau. We are delighted to see the potential utility of P-tau217 not just for diagnosing disease, but also for monitoring treatment efficacy. We believe this could be another important contribution to the Alzheimer's field. Finally, on Slide 18, the significant relationship between plasma P-tau217 reduction and the slowing of cognitive decline is shown. This additional biomarker for efficacy links the donanemab mechanism of amyloid plaque clearance with positive effects on both clinical outcomes and tau pathology. These data suggest that patients who achieved a 30% decrease in P-tau217 from baseline showed more than 40% slowing of disease progression. The 3 main findings I just discussed. One, the consistency of clinical benefit across statistical methods; two, the correlation of plaque lowering the clinical benefit, the patients who achieved the greatest plaque clearance. I mean, the greatest opportunity for benefit; and three, the correlation between achieving complete plaque clearance and beneficial effects on tau pathology seen in the brain and measured in the periphery, which themselves are predictors for clinical benefit, strongly support the efficacy of donanemab and give us confidence that the remarkable levels of amyloid plaque clearance achieved by donanemab could translate into a meaningful breakthrough for patients. Moving to Slide 19. Accordingly, we've announced that we plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway before the end of this year based on data from completed studies, supplemented by additional safety data from the ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. We remain focused on enrolling TRAILBLAZER-2 with the aim to replicate the positive results of TRAILBLAZER-1. Replication is important to overcome skepticism in the field. We hope that TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 will generate important confirmatory data for patients, physicians and payers and help us understand how to make sure the right patient gets the right duration of therapy at the right stage of disease. We are pleased to announce today that we have closed screening for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, with an adequate number of subjects now in the trial's screening process to fully enroll the study. Given that conducting and processing and imaging studies used during screening take several weeks to complete, we expect that the final subject to complete screening procedures and receive their first dose of donanemab or placebo by the end of the third quarter and the study will complete 18 months later. Given this progress in enrollment, we are confident that we will achieve the number and duration of drug exposures needed to appropriately characterize the safety profile of donanemab, allowing for regulatory submission by the end of this year. Discussions with the FDA are consistent with our prior statement supporting a submission before the end of 2021. I also want to provide a few comments on how we believe the national coverage determination opened for monoclonal antibody therapies targeting amyloid by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may impact Lilly and donanemab. We believe this NCD is a clear opportunity to focus treatment on the patients most likely to benefit from amyloid plaque-reducing therapies. This would align with our goals, which have long been to use advanced diagnostic tools to identify the right patients that can benefit the most from amyloid-reducing therapies. We're particularly encouraged that our progress with the plasma P-tau217 assay could open up broader access to diagnostic tools. Still, despite the advances in diagnostics and the promise of donanemab, we acknowledge the current skepticism in the national discussion. And we hope that each drug will be evaluated by payers and prescribers based on its own data. This could be particularly important given the data I've shared today, which suggests that the degree of donanemab's amyloid plaque clearance relates to clinical benefit. In summary, we look forward to submitting donanemab to the FDA later this year with the potential to bring a robust amyloid plaque-clearing agent with limited treatment duration to market for early symptomatic Alzheimer's patients in 2022 with potential replicated clinical efficacy results expected in 2023. Transitioning now to Verzenio. On the last earnings call, we commented that FDA had asked to see an overall survival trend in favor of Verzenio in the monarchE trial in adjuvant breast cancer. We also noted that the OS data set is quite immature in the overall population, which makes interpretation challenging. We have now provided to the FDA additional data from the monarchE study, and we were encouraged to see continued strengthening of the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival, IDFS, as well as consistent benefit in the key secondary endpoint of distant recurrence-free survival, DRFS. Of note, with this continued follow-up, we can now confirm this benefit extends beyond the 2-year Verzenio treatment period. We look forward to disclosing this new analysis at a medical meeting this fall. Our discussions with the FDA have focused on the prespecified subpopulation of patients with high Ki-67 index, a marker of increased cell proliferation. These patients have more aggressive disease and higher risk of relapse and thus are more mature for overall survival analysis. This group, which makes up approximately half of the monarchE population, are demonstrating an overall survival trend that favors the treatment arm. And based on FDA feedback, we expect an initial approval in adjuvant breast cancer in this population before the end of the year, in line with the current review cycle. Importantly, since the IDFS and DRFS hazard ratios favoring Verzenio are similar in patients with high and low Ki-67 index, we expect that the OS trend first seen in the Ki-67 high population will, in time, be replicated in the broader study population. We hope to expand the label to the entire enrolled population in the future once we see more overall survival events in the broader population. To date, regulators outside the U.S. have not raised the same questions on overall survival. Finally, moving to Olumiant. We shared in July that the FDA will not meet the PDUFA action date for the supplemental new drug application for atopic dermatitis. This delay is related to the FDA's ongoing assessment of JAK inhibitors. Patient safety is critical to Lilly, and we continue to further evaluate baricitinib's safety profile with ongoing randomized and observational safety studies. We're confident that the efficacy and safety data for baricitinib support a favorable benefit risk profile for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA during the remainder of the review process. We do not have additional information on timing or specific action date from the FDA, but we see potential for regulatory action for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. later this year. We're committed to bringing Olumiant to market in the U.S. to help meet the needs for people living with atopic dermatitis. Slide 20 shows select pipeline opportunities as of July 30, and Slide 21 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several additional major developments since our last earnings call and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. In May, we shared the positive results for tirzepatide in SURPASS-4 and announced that the SURPASS program met regulatory submission requirements for evaluating cardiovascular risk and confirmed our intention to submit a registration package for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes to global regulatory authorities by the end of 2021. At ADA in June, tirzepatide was a large focus as we shared detailed data for the first 4 studies from the tirzepatide SURPASS program for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These results support our belief that tirzepatide may represent a substantial improvement in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, with early and unsurpassed improvements in A1c and body weight reduction across doses. We remain on track for global regulatory submissions before the end of this year. We are also excited about tirzepatide's opportunity across multiple indications, including cardiovascular outcomes, obesity, NASH and heart failure. In Q2, we initiated SUMMIT, our planned Phase 3 study for tirzepatide in heart failure. In July, we achieved an important milestone with Jardiance as the first and only medicine to achieve a primary endpoint for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. The EMPEROR-Preserved Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint and demonstrated significant risk reduction with Jardiance for the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure in adults with HFpEF. This is a significant breakthrough for patients, and we're proud of what we've achieved here in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim. We look forward to presenting detailed results from this study at the European Society of Cardiology on August 27, and we expect to submit this indication to regulators later this year. We also received approval in the EU for Jardiance HFrEF in June and expect regulatory action in the U.S. and Japan later this year for this indication. Additionally, we've advanced our GGG tri-agonist into Phase 2 for diabetes based on the promising data we shared at ADA, which supports the potential for differentiated efficacy from tirzepatide with respect to body weight while maintaining glycemic control. We also started 2 Phase 1 studies for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Lastly, we removed one of our oral GIP/GLP Phase 1 molecules from our pipeline. In oncology, we also continue to make important progress. Starting with Verzenio, we've initiated 2 Phase 3 studies since our last update. As planned, we've initiated an adjuvant study for HR+ HER2 breast cancer. And we are announcing today that a result -- as a result of a favorable blinded interim analysis for our Phase 2 trial in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, we've also initiated the Phase 3 portion of this adaptive study. This action was based on a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee, or IDMC. The IDMC reviewed interim efficacy and safety data and concluded that the results met the prespecified expansion criteria based on radiographic progression-free survival and recommended advancing the study to the registrational Phase 3 stage. While Lilly remains blinded to the study, we are obviously very pleased with this development and have already begun dosing patients in the Phase 3 portion of this trial. Given that the expansion of Phase 3 includes the cohort of patients who are in the Phase 2 study, these data remain blinded and we will not be disclosing these at medical meeting. On the development front in oncology, we also made progress with pirtobrutinib and our oral SERD. We've initiated the Phase 3 study for pirtobrutinib in relapsed/refractory MCL monotherapy, executing on our commitment to a robust Phase 3 program for this molecule. Regarding oral SERD, we announced our plans to begin a Phase 3 study later in 2021 based on the Phase 1 results we shared at ASCO in June that showed an efficacy and safety profile in line with our expectations. In addition, we've now achieved the first human dose for our next-generation KRAS G12C inhibitor. Lastly, in oncology, we announced that the FDA has accepted our submission of sintilimab for non-small cell lung cancer. This submission is an encouraging start for our collaborative efforts with Innovent to make sintilimab available in countries beyond China. In neurodegeneration, in addition to donanemab news I just shared, we anticipate a Phase 2 readout for zagotenemab later this year and note that our GBA1 gene therapy asset from PREVAIL started a Phase 2 study in type 2 Gaucher disease. For immunology, we do not have additional significant updates in Q2 but we're looking forward to the Phase 3 readouts of lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis and baricitinib for lupus later this year. We also submitted baricitinib for alopecia areata in Japan. Lastly, we're moving our COVID-19 antibody therapy, LY-CoV1404, now known as bebtelovimab, into Phase 2 to address viral variants as part of our ongoing commitment to help combat COVID-19, if needed. To recap, Q2 was another positive quarter for R&D at Lilly, and we're excited about a number of further readouts and important milestones coming later this year, reflecting continued advances on behalf of patients suffering from disease. Now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Yes. Sure, Terence. Thanks for that question on donanemab and FDA and safety. In June, when we got the Breakthrough Therapy designation and we announced our expectations to file the BLA by the end of the year, that was based on our current understanding of the situation. Since then, things have progressed and I would say I'm even more confident now than I was then, that we should have an adequate package to support a complete submission by the end of this year. That includes, of course, our confidence that we have enough safety data to support a full evaluation of the benefit/risk of this drug. I think given limited duration of dosing, that helps as well as given the near completion now of enrollment in TRAILBLAZER-2. So it's our intent then to use combined safety data from the completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies as well as an early look at safety data from that ongoing Phase 3 study to support the package. Now of course, with any ongoing study, there's always risk. We don't know what that safety data is going to show. If it's consistent with safety data we've collected prior to the study, then I think we should also be confident that, that would support a positive benefit/risk assessment and put us on track to launch next year, as we said. Yes. Thanks, Ronny, for the question on biomarkers and their commercial use. Of course, this has been an area of great progress and great investment by Lilly. We continue to put a lot of emphasis here. I think objectively, you wouldn't have had the progress that we're seeing now in Alzheimer's disease had it not been for the ability to select patients for treatment and follow their response treatment with biomarkers. We don't see that as a research-only application. That should be available, those kinds of tools, to patients in the clinical -- who are being clinically treated for Alzheimer's disease in the future. So the status of the tools right now is both of the PET agents, the tau PET imaging with Tauvid that we use in the amyloid PET imaging with Amyvid. Those are both, of course, FDA approved and availability is somewhat limited right now, particularly for Tauvid, but could quickly be scaled with the launch of donanemab in the future. The third agent, which is probably the one that will be the most accessible to patients is the phospho-tau217 assay. Just as we continue to work on that assay, we're more and more impressed with its performance, its ability to identify patients, and even as I've shown today, track their progression. So this could be an answer for patients in the near term. We'll work hard to make that available. The bar is often lower for in vitro diagnostics and in vivo diagnostics. And I think there's good potential there. You asked about the patient flow once all these things are approved and available and presumably, that happens around the time that donanemab launched but not before. I think it would make sense and fit with medical practice if screening starts with some sort of simple cognitive exams by a physician to assess the patient's eligibility to early Alzheimer's, then they would move on to probably a blood-based test like phospho-tau217. If that's positive, that could either be a basis for treatment depending on if data support that or that could triage patients to PET scans for further evaluation. Okay. Thanks. No, it's a good question and line of questions here on subcu dosing for anti-amyloid therapies. Probably 2 factors that we have taken into account in addition to the ones you mentioned. First and most important is efficacy for patients. And I think all of the data that we have so far suggest and support the notion that deep and rapid clearance is key here. And so if you're going to go to subcu dosing, it's important to make sure you do get enough drug in so that you can quickly get patients to clear. That's not going to always be possible with every drug. I think the second consideration with subcu dosing is the duration of therapy. So if it's a limited duration of therapy, the difference between IV and subcu, if it's once a month for 6 months, that's not a big difference between IV and subcu. Whereas if it's for the rest of your life, maybe that is a bigger difference. Finally, with respect to our plans for subcu, I do think it's an important option to offer patients, notwithstanding the previous comments, even for a limited duration therapy, some patients may prefer it, assuming you can get the same kind of efficacy. I think with donanemab, that's unlikely to be possible, and we're not pursuing it given the doses we need and the formulation we have. However, we have a second-generation antibody here that we call N3pG4, which I think is quite likely to be viable in a subcutaneous presentation. And that is our focus of development around N3pG4. My expectation around that is that it should be able to show comparable amyloid plaque lowering with subcutaneous dosing as donanemab does with IV dosing. If so, given the similarities between the drugs, we would seek an accelerated approval pathway for that drug in the future as sort of a subcutaneous version of donanemab, although it is a new enemy. Your second question was around the phospho-tau assay and whether that's a significant revenue stream. It's certainly conceivable and we haven't sort of thought through all of our commercial plans around that. But really for Lilly, and it may be significant for some companies, I think for Lilly, though, our focus is on removing barriers for treatment to patients. And so as we think about how we position diagnostics and therapeutics in the marketplace, our focus will be on really making sure that most patients possible can get treated appropriately. Yes. So your question is -- maybe I'll break it in two parts. The first part is like how important is in the near term to have additional cognitive benefit data for amyloid plaque [lung] drugs. And then in the longer term, what happens if the confirmatory studies give a negative surprise. So in the short term, I'd just clarify that we have compelling clinical efficacy data for donanemab. The only trial that's going to be successful, a positive Phase II study and its primary endpoint showing cognitive benefits for donanemab, that's different, unique and exciting, published in the New England Journal, that's exciting. And I think that will be helpful even before we have the confirmatory data, being in that unique position. There will be some physicians, I'm sure, as are today, who still say, I don't want to use a drug until I have cognitive data. Fine, for those physicians who are willing to make that link between the surrogate efficacy data and the Phase II data in donanemab, if you believe that lowering amyloid plaque is the good thing to do, you're going to want the drug that lowers amyloid plaque the most. And I think that's an exciting aspect of donanemab as well. But then we come to the confirmatory studies. I think surely everyone have to acknowledge if for multiple sponsors, multiple drugs are all clearly negative, that would be a bad thing and we would retreat and say that this was a wrong way of thinking. I think that scenario is extremely unlikely. I think the most likely scenario is probably a mixed picture. Some drugs will be better than others. Some trials will reach significance, others might not. You've heard me speak about the confidence in our trial, but we have to see the data. I think in that scenario, that will strengthen -- that would be good enough to reinforce the notion that amyloid is an important surrogate and reducing amyloid is a good idea. Okay. Three great questions, Umer. Thanks. So the first question, you asked if we'd use interim data, I commented that we'll take a safety cut of data in the right way to support that submission. We don't plan to support that submission or do we see the need to support that submission with any looks at efficacy data. We have adequate efficacy data supporting the plaque lowering, which would be the basis of submission and approval under accelerated approval. Your second question is once plaque clears, how long does it take to come back? We have some data on that that was also presented at AAIC. I didn't highlight it this morning. But what we found is that off therapy, there is very slow, negligible, really, regrowth of plaque. I think if you sort of extrapolate it out, it might take 14 or 15 years or something like that to regrow amyloid plaque. The average age of patients in this trial is 75. And remember, we haven't fully halted progression of disease. So that doesn't feel like a near-term thinking on redosing will be necessary to keep them clear. But we'll have the ability to follow patients for many, many years and confirm that. Finally, I think you've correctly summarized the situation, which is that in our initial analysis, we didn't see a correlation and now we are reporting that we do see a correlation. Why is that? And of course, correlation can't prove causation so it is just a correlation. So why do we see it now? I think what we learned was quite interesting. And that's that the amount of plaque you remove depends a lot on how much plaque you have to start with. So if you only have 50 centiloids of plaque, there's only so much you can remove. If you have 100 centiloids of plaque based on, you can remove a lot more. So that turns out to be a pretty important compound in these kinds of correlations. The people who are -- have the more severe disease, perhaps longer duration, lower cognitive performance, older age, they might have more plaque at baseline, you can remove more but they still might be the worst progressors than people who have lower plaque and you remove less. So, I think our thinking initially, and maybe the field thinking, was a little bit backwards on this to look for a straight correlation between change and change without adjusting for all of those important baseline covariance. Yes. So Andrew, you've asked a follow-up question here, an important one, on the potential even in the face of an accelerated review for accelerated approval, rather, for plaque lowering, whether we'd still be keen to get that kind of data a bit earlier by pulling forward an interim on TRAILBLAZER-2. We haven't ruled that out. We also don't have plans at this moment in time. I think we just need to see where we are and where the field is. But really, the -- maintaining a pristine Phase III trial would probably be a pretty high priority, particularly if accelerated approval gives the path for patients to have access to the medicine, then it becomes less urgent to get that data faster. So that's our current thinking. We've been working hard to make sure we have manufacturing capacity. I feel good about where we are to support launch and growth of donanemab and hopefully someday enter PG4 even to follow that. With respect to the commercialization of a P-tau diagnostic, there are different paths forward for an in vitro diagnostic, including a lab-developed test, or LDT, which can be done in a centralized location, for example, under CLIA. And that's a pretty fast path and that's one of the options that we consider. Okay. Thanks. Two sort of commercially focused questions on donanemab. I mean the first one on the national coverage decision, determination -- of course, that's important. When -- I think it was widely said that when the first approval came, it was quite broad an indication and then subsequently, the FDA working with the sponsor focused the patient population. I think there could still be opportunity for further focusing here. And that's one direction the experts at CMS may take. In that case, it could be requiring patients to have evidence of Alzheimer's pathology in the form of amyloid plaques or even tau pathology. As I said before, I think that matches our goals and what we think is right. It will take some time for that to play out probably over the next nine months or so and surely will be part of some of those discussions and share our data and thinking in the right way. And then on pricing, I think I simply say it's too early to comment on that. We have some time yet. Yes. So with respect to the safety hurdle for donanemab or for any drug, really, it's having adequate exposures and duration of exposures in a broad population to be able to fully assess the benefit risk of a given drug. Now that's not a number that depends on the particulars of the drug, the population, of course, that you hope to treat the duration of therapy, of course, but also the particulars around the safety data and the efficacy data that you collect. So it would be nice and easy, I think, for sponsors and the FDA if there was a particular line in the sand that could be drawn. But as I said, it needs to be tailored for each drug. Based on our current thinking and analysis and discussions, as I said, I think we'll be there comfortably at the end of this year. Your second question was about -- I think it was about the duration of benefit as the TRAILBLAZER data mature. I commented on the duration of plaque lowering, which appears to be sustained. But I think, Geoff, you're getting at the duration of the cognitive benefit. We see a slowing of decline on average between that patients are still declining. You could ask, are the lines coming together or going apart? I think on some of the cuts to the initial data, there might have been a perception that the lines were not diverging at the later time points, I think, as I showed the additional statistical methods. And even as we look at the raw data, we're pretty comfortable here that we have lines that diverge over time. And therefore, I would expect that, that benefit of slowing would continue over time. But too soon to have real data on that. Yes. You're asking, Seamus, very smartly about the criteria to expand the study from our Phase II study to a Phase III study. I don't think we want to get into the very precise details on what that was. But you're correct that it was a very robust threshold. So we're excited to see that happen. We take Phase III starts very seriously at Lilly. We don't want Phase III failures. So when we have studies like this one, in any therapeutic area where we move from Phase II to Phase III without ever seeing the data, we set aggressive bars that data really have to match to move forward to Phase III. So you can expect that's what we did here. Anne for more detail. Last question was on NCD and why did I say that we think we -- each drug should be evaluated on its own merits. Is that an allusion to pricing or something like that? No, my primary focus here is on the patient and the outcomes that a drug could deliver, which, even within the same class, could be different. Our theory and I presented data today to support that theory, is that the amount of amyloid you remove and how quickly you do that is important for predicting outcomes. If that's the case, you can easily imagine different drugs, even with the same class having different benefits for patients and some of those benefits may be above a threshold for coverage and others may not. That's conceivable. Not what I anticipate is the most likely scenario, but we want to be prepared for all scenarios here. Yes. Thanks, Matthew, for the question there. No, we don't have a regulator's view on the Conrado model. But we're encouraged that this model was built, as I said earlier, by the CAMD -- by data from the CAMD consortium and has been around for a while and used for various applications. What we're doing here, though, to be clear, is checking a patient's progression against what we predict their progression would be. So knowing all of their baseline factors, how much would the predicted to have progressed had they not been on drug versus how much did they actually progress. And so that's essentially what you're seeing in the graph. You're right, even with full plaque clearance, there's still some progression. There's only a 40% decrease. Now that's as big an effect as anyone ever has talked about in Alzheimer's disease, but surely, over time, we're going to need additional therapeutics for Alzheimer's beyond just clearing the plaque, at least in this stage of disease. And I think that's probably where tau therapeutics come into play. So that's how we think about it. I think earlier in the disease course, it could be quite different. Perhaps if you get it early enough, you could have 100% disease slowing in progression and in essence, no Alzheimer's, but that is yet to be proven."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slides 7 and 8 summarize financial performance in the second quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. Revenue increased 23% this quarter compared to Q2 2020 or 12% excluding the items Dave mentioned earlier, representing strong momentum for our core business. Given the COVID-19 related stocking, and destocking seen between Q1 and Q2 of 2020, our first half performance of 11% revenue growth or 8% in constant currency, excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue is a more accurate reflection of underlying performance, and the sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue growth better represent the strength in our core business. Sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 for core business, increase in vaccination rates in many major markets, and the majority of our sales reps now being back in the field, suggests the recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectation for the quarter. We're particularly pleased with the strong volume growth across key brands like Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio in the U.S. grew nearly 6 percentage points in share total prescription exiting June, compared to the prior year. While Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance increased their leading market share in the same period, while class growth accelerated. These products along with other key growth products represented 54% of revenue in the core business this quarter. Gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 30 basis points to 79.3% in Q2. The decrease in gross margin percent was driven primarily by unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding this FX impact, gross margin as a percent of revenue grew 60 points this quarter. Total operating expenses grew 18% this quarter, compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16% as the base period in Q2 2020 included a meaningful reduction in direct-to-consumer marketing and customer-facing expenses as health care system closed. R&D expenses increased 20% driven by investment in exciting late-stage pipeline opportunities, including pirtobrutinib, tirzepatide, donanemab and lebrikizumab. In Q2, we also invested approximately $85 million in COVID therapy's R&D bringing our total COVID-19 R&D investment to approximately $300 million year-to-date. Net of COVID-19 R&D investment, operating expense growth was 18% compared to Q2 of 2020, and 10% for the first half of the year.  Operating income increased 29% compared to Q2 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 29.4% for the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by revenue growth outpacing expense growth, and we expect continued margin expansion in the second half of 2021. Other income and expense was income of $5 million this quarter, compared to expense of $57 million in Q2 2020, driven by income from European patent settlements for Alimta.  Our effective tax rate was 14.4%, an increase of 350 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods were reduced by net discrete tax benefit, with the lower net discreet tax benefit reflected in the second quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 29% in Q2, and 22% year-to-date or 30% and 24%, respectively, in constant currency.  On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. And we are encouraged by the growth seen across most of our major geographies. This quarter U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue, and the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking, the core business grew 8% in the U.S., up from 5% in Q1 on that same basis. These results were driven entirely by volume laid by Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance. Pricing was a 1% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, with increased rebates to maintain excellent access and higher growth in lower net price segments, largely offset by lower utilization into 340B segment, changes for estimates to rebates and discounts, and to a lesser extent, modest list price increases. The year-to-date price decline of 3% in the U.S. is in line with our net price expectations for the full-year.  Specific to Taltz in the U.S., performance for the quarter was in line with the expectation we described on the Q1 earnings call. And we were pleased to see a return to net sales growth this quarter, as volume gains more than offset price decline. Taltz Q2 performance benefited from a favorable change to prior estimates for rebates and discounts, and COVID-19 related inventory destocking last year. Excluding these items, Taltz still returned to double-digit growth in the second quarter. We believe the net price decline for Taltz in the first half of 2021 represents the underlying full price trend, and that continued volume growth will drive net sales acceleration in the second half of the year. While midterm price trends are currently stable, given increasing variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported U.S. net price changes across our business.  Moving to Europe, revenue grew 27% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the negative impact of Q2 2020 COVID-19 related customer buying patterns, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven entirely by volume growth, primarily for Trulicity, Taltz, Alimta and Olumiant. We continue to be pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth in the second half of this year, excluding the expected impact from the loss of exclusivity for Alimta. In Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency, driven primarily by the launches of Olumiant and Emgality. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted by the decreased demand for several products that have lost market exclusivity. But our key growth products grew 21% in Q2 in Japan, and represented approximately 50% of the business there. Recent surges of COVID-19 cases continue to negatively impact recovery in Japan. So, we currently expect improved revenue growth in the second half of the year, based on the uptake of newer products. In China, revenue grew 106% in constant currency, primarily driven by the divestiture of Cialis and the launches of Tyvyt and Trulicity. Excluding the impact from the Cialis transaction, our revenue in China grew 35% in constant currency. We are excited about the continued momentum in China as sales of new medicines have accelerated significantly in the past 3 quarters. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by our key growth products. At the bottom of the slide is the price rate volume effect on revenue for our June year-to-date results, which shows double-digit growth across all major geographies, except Japan. As shown on Slide 10, our key growth products continue to drive strong worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 17 percentage points of growth this quarter and continue to drive our overall performance and outlook. Slide 11 highlights the contributions of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated over $3.5 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 54% of our core business revenue in Q2. We're encouraged by the strength of our key products in Q2, collectively up over 34% compared to the same period last year. Trulicity, Taltz, Verzenio and Jardiance, all continue to outgrow their respective classes. We are now tracking above pre-COVID-19 new-to-brand prescription baseline in the U.S. across all major therapeutic areas, with the exception of oncology and the CGRP antibody class, which we expect will continue to recover in the second half of the year. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first half of 2021, we invested $5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of after-tax investments in R&D, business development and capital investments. In addition, we returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders in dividend and share repurchase. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we will continue to fund our growth of our key products and recent launches, invest in our pipeline and seek external innovation to augment our future prospects as well as returning capital to shareholders. Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 13. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. While the COVID-19 pandemic is still impacting countries around the world, the pace of recovery from the pandemic was in line with our expectations in Q2. New-to-brand scripts in most of the classes in which we compete with are tracking above pre-COVID baseline in the U.S. and health care systems in most major markets are largely returning to normal as we enter the second half of 2021. We are increasing our full year revenue outlook for the core business by $200 million to reflect the strong performance and favorable impact from foreign exchange. We are, however, lowering the top end of the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue by $400 million and confirming the bottom end of that range. Moving forward, we expect COVID-19 antibody revenues to be less of a factor, as demonstrated by Q2 revenue declining to $150 million from $810 million in Q1. As variants are growing, we recognize the situations across the globe can evolve quickly and we plan to adapt as required. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.8 billion to $27.4 billion. Our outlook for non-GAAP gross margin percent remains unchanged at approximately 79%. On a reported basis, we've lowered guidance for gross margin percent to approximately 75% to reflect the impact of COVID-19 antibodies' excess inventory charge due to the combination of changes to current and forecasted demand from the U.S. and international government and near-term expiry of COVID-19 antibodies inventory. For research and development and SG&A, our guidance ranges remain unchanged. However, investment in promising R&D opportunities and exciting potential launches could push us towards the top end of our guidance range for both R&D and SG&A. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance is now expected to be approximately 30%, driven by lower COVID-19 antibody revenue. However, it remains approximately 31%, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Our GAAP operating margin is now expected to be approximately 24%. We are increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $0 to $100 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlements in Europe I noted earlier. And our GAAP range is now income of $375 million to $475 million, which also reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our expected tax rate remains unchanged. And on a reported basis, we've lowered our expected tax rate to approximately 12%. Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share remains unchanged at $7.80 to $8, while GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $6.73 to $6.93, primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 antibody inventory charge, the impact of equity investment gains and the Alimta patent settlements in Europe. We are confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. As we look at the underlying volume and share trends across our key growth products, we're confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first half of this year strengthen our conviction in our midterm and long-term outlook for continued top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to provide an update on our pipeline. Yes. Let me just add just more general comment on pricing movement through the year, and I know we've had numerous conversations on this. And it does -- there does tend to be some volatility throughout the year. We do tend to see as patient flow through the health care system, more pronounced impact from the coverage gap in the second and third quarter of the year. So you see that dynamic throughout every -- really every year, as Mike said. And we built those assumptions into our full year guidance in terms of pricing dynamics for the year. And obviously, as we have more color and insight, we'll provide that. But right now, as we look at the full year estimate for U.S. pricing dynamic, it's consistent with what we previously discussed in terms of overall erosion. You saw 3% for the first half of the year, which is what you should expect for the full year."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Yes. Chris, thanks for the question. And as Dan shared, we are incredibly pleased with what we're seeing out of Verzenio and the monarchE data and as he shared key endpoints, such as IDFS have continued to strengthen with further follow-up. And now we have two years of median follow-up. And so very pleased with that, and as he shared, we remain very confident there will be an OS trend favoring Verzenio in the broader population. So we would work with the FDA to expand our label to include these patients in the future. So obviously, this is event driven and so the timing of this will be determined by the event rate. So our next planned analysis is in the second half of '22, and this analysis will help us really further inform the timing of that final analysis. So as you commented, the overall survival data in the broader population is still immature. We still have less than 50% of the events needed to do that final OS analysis. But with what we're seeing, and again, strong performance in both the high and low Ki67, we remain confident to see this trend in OS favoring Verzenio to replicate. As far as Ki67, good news here is that this is really a familiar concept to physicians. It is already accepted as a prognostic factor in breast cancer. And it's really easily performed through an IHC assay, so very simple assay. And these are broadly available in the pathology labs. And the assay and the methodology that we used on monarchE is straightforward and proven to be accurate and really highly reproducible. So our belief is that oncologists will move to quickly adopt this in practice. And really, this clarity in patients with the highest risk, I think, will help to accelerate uptake in this setting. So we look forward to launching in this setting. Yes. I mean, as Dan said, we were incredibly pleased with this outcome and the recommendation by the DMC, and we set a very aggressive threshold on this adaptive design, and we're impressed that it met that threshold. And I think it just continues to be another example of how Verzenio differentiates from the competition. So the Phase III is open. It's already enrolling patients. We anticipate the results of the analysis in 2024. On the question on market size, so CYCLONE 2 is -- it's a metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer trial that really targets patients who have not yet received prior novel hormonal agent, so in earlier settings. So our initial research shows that the addressable market could be in the range of 25% to 50% of metastatic CRPC. So it's depending really a bit on how the market evolves with the use of NHAs in that earlier setting. So in the U.S., for example, based on that, we currently estimate between 7,000 and 14,000 patients would match that inclusion criteria for CYCLONE 2. And exciting in this space is that as long as being a high unmet need in a large patient population, there's also a long length of anticipated treatment duration. So this could be a treatment duration of up to two years or longer. So that's why we're particularly excited about this opportunity, is what it delivers there. There is no RB or other biomarker requirements in the study. Well, thanks, Steve. And as Dan shared, we're going to be presenting data from this recent analysis at a medical meeting later this year. So we won't be able to share further details and then, obviously, due to the embargo. But as you can tell, we are very pleased to see the data continue to strengthen in this latest analysis with more than two years of follow-up. As we stated previously, the overall survival data remains immature. So at this point, what I can share is we have less than half of the events needed, so less than 50% of the events needed for the prespecified OS analysis. So the data remains immature. Again, we were really pleased, even with that immaturity, to see that the patients with highest risk already had this favorable trend. But thanks for the question and look forward to sharing more at a meeting later on."

So the only gating factor here is how quickly we can summarize the data and submit to the regulators, which we plan to do by the end of the year to major global regulators. Yes. Thanks for the question, really nothing new to report on Trulicity pricing. At the beginning of the year, we gave guidance that when you take a look at the impact of increased rates and market, second mix and offset by lower utilization, 340B and modest list price increases, that for the year, we would see low single-digit price decline for Trulicity. That's what we're experiencing, so really nothing new to update at this point in the year. Okay. Thanks for the question. Yes, we have only announced a HFpEF study for tirzepatide, and that's currently all we're planning on announcing at this point. I think we're very confident in the opportunity of tirzepatide in the HFpEF. When you look at patients that have HFpEF, there's a large segment that also are obese and obesity is a [steep] phenotype within this patient population. So I think we feel good about our -- the results we've seen in our Phase II studies that give us, I think, confidence that we'll be successful in HFpEF. And so right now, our efforts are focused on HFpEF."

            "content": "Sure, happy to take the question on SERD. We're pleased with how the drug is performing clinically. It's doing everything that we expected it to do from a pharmacology safety and efficacy perspective. I think the data package that we presented at ASCO and that which we continue to see in the trial subsequent to ASCO, placed the drug in a vacuum on par with the best agents in development from our peers. But this is not a class of medicine that stands on its own period. This is really a development program. And I think as it relates to me-tooism, what I would say is that we're not interested in pursuing a me-too development program, and we stand by that statement. And frankly, our leadership position in breast cancer, in particular, with emerging Verzenio data as we've been talking about today, I think, put us in a unique position as it relates to this class of medicines. That all having been said, I also think we are a bit more cautious about the long-term role of SERDs in this landscape, and we're looking forward to some randomized data for the first time from some of our competitors later this year that I think will shed some light on where these drugs ought to fit in the overall treatment paradigm. Yes, a question on SERD. Of course, we plan to explore combining our oral SERD with CDK4/6, in particular, with abemaciclib. We're doing that right now in the context of an expansion cohort of the Phase I/II trial, the same trial for which we presented data at ASCO has expansion cohorts that contemplate rational combinations, including with abemaciclib."

            "name": "David Ricks",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Q2 of last year was the peak of the pandemic's negative impact to our business. And one year later, I'm proud of the innovation and resilience displayed by my Lilly colleagues to deliver against our objectives in new ways, while also mobilizing to develop treatments to help combat COVID-19. Looking at Q2 2021, we were encouraged by the increasing worldwide vaccination rates, as well as the underlying environment in most of our major markets. COVID-19 related stocking in Q1 followed by destocking in Q2 of last year, complicates quarterly performance comparisons. Therefore, looking at revenue growth in the first half of 2021 better reflects the underlying trends in our business. On today's call, we will provide year-over-year comparisons for both Q2 and the first half of the year. In the first half of 2021, we delivered 11% growth in our core business. This excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, this was buoyed by strong volume driven growth across key brands in major geographies, including the U.S., Europe, and China.  Turning specifically to Q2, revenue grew 23% compared to Q2 2020, or 20% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume growth of 22 percentage points. As previously highlighted, in Q2 2020, we saw reversal of the $250 million pandemic related product stocking which occurred in Q1 2020. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue, the Q2 2020 COVID-19 related destocking and the sale of Cialis in China, our core business grew 12% for the quarter, up from 7% in Q1 on the same basis.  We were pleased to see sequential top line growth in the core business this quarter, signaling that healthcare systems continue recovery from the pandemic and the strength of our underlying business. Key growth products continue to drive our revenue growth and represent 54% of our core business this quarter. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.3% in Q2, or 79.7% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Excluding the FX impact, our gross margin increased by approximately 60 basis points compared to last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 29.4%, representing an improvement of nearly 140 basis points. We were pleased to see operating margin expand year-over-year and we expect continued expansion in the second half of this year.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our earnings call in April, including receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation for donanemab and announcing our plan to submit to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway; announcing positive Phase 3 results for tirzepatide SURPASS-4 trial with planned global submissions of the SURPASS program for tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes by the end of 2021; obtaining approval for Jardiance in partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for HFrEF in Europe; and announcing positive Phase 3 results from the EMPEROR-Preserved trial for Jardiance in HFpEF, the first and only successful trial for this patient population; and initiating Phase 3 trial results for pirtobrutinib in mantle-cell lymphoma, tirzepatide in HFpEF and Verzenio in HR+ HER2+ early breast cancer, and now, prostate cancer.  We also continue to augment our pipeline with business development deals and announced the acquisition of Protomer Technologies. We welcome the Protomer team to Lilly and are excited to bring this technology to our diabetes pipeline. As we believe glucose sensing is one, maybe become the next generation for insulin treatment to improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes.  Lastly, on financials, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases in the quarter and authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion in stock in addition to the $500 million authorization remaining under our 2018 share repurchase program. Moving on to slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including a May webcast, which highlighted our updated environmental, social and governance strategy and our sustainability efforts, as well as the launch of a new ESG website to serve as a comprehensive resource to provide increased transparency regarding the company's ESG goals and progress. Further, as part of our goal to become carbon-neutral in our own operations at our manufacturing plant in Kinsale, we recently inaugurated a new solar field, which is now the largest in Ireland. We also announced donations of COVID-19 therapies at no cost to low income and lower middle income countries, heavily impacted by the pandemic, and are proud of the impact we're having around the world, as we work to combat COVID-19. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q2 results and to provide an update on our financial guidance for 2020. Thanks a lot, Dan. I appreciate that. Before we go to the Q&A, let me sum up the progress we've made during this quarter. We've seen strength in our core business in the first half of this year and increased momentum in Q2. This is driven by strong volume-driven growth across key brands in most major geographies. We're pleased to see sequential top line growth this quarter as well as year-over-year margin expansion. We made significant progress developing new medicines, and Q2 was another positive quarter for our pipeline as we announced plans to submit tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes and donanemab in Alzheimer's disease later this year as well as an approval for Jardiance in HFrEF, and as Dan outlined, positive results in HFpEF. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders through dividends and completed $500 million in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are quite confident in our long-term prospects. Before we move on to Q&A, I would like to share -- also like to share that we will hold a live investor meeting this December to highlight our R&D pipeline and progress for investors. We will also provide our initial 2022 guidance at this meeting. Given the limited physical space available, this event will have an accompanying webcast. We're hopeful that we can host this event in person, but are watching the evolution of the pandemic closely and we'll adjust accordingly to a virtual event, if needed. Our IR team will be in contact in the coming weeks to issue invitations and provide more logistical details on this meeting. Now let me turn it over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session. And maybe just a comment -- thanks, Dan, Tim, on the access and payment environment, I think our priority at Lilly is always going to be how to make it easier for patients to get to a therapy and then we solve for value on the back end. There are clearly benefits in the short-duration treatment, like Dan said, with donanemab in a Part B. They're going to be watched closely by their physicians initially anyway. There are real and important side effects, which require imaging analysis for this class of drugs. And so it's an intensively managed disease. But through time, as we've seen with other classes, as comfort level will rise in primary care, in particular, in using therapeutic antibodies to treat Alzheimer's, a more convenient form available at our local pharmacy, perhaps for self-injection or injection by a caregiver, would be preferred. So our plans line up with -- in pursuing both those channels, although in early days, probably the intensive nature of the treatment and specialist nature will favor the infusion. But we're committed to both, and we're solving for patient convenience at the end of the day. Yes. I appreciate the question, and we totally get the curiosity. There's, as you understand, probably lot of limitations of what we would say at this stage. One of the reasons for the limitation is really the ultimate label we have and the value we can demonstrate to customers is a key input at Lilly for pricing. And we have -- fortunately, the only study in the space that hit its pre-specified endpoint for disease reduction -- or disease progression reduction, and those are key. As we demonstrated at AAIC, we continue to cut that data. I think there was an earlier question about how we might differentiate in the NCD process, but that's one of them as we have this completed study with exquisite biomarker profiles of the product and can continue to elucidate what donanemab does in the brains of Alzheimer's patients in ways that perhaps others could not. And those are inputs as well. Finally, Lilly has been a leader in value-based concepts and really partnerships to make sure that the appropriate patients can easily access at low out-of-pocket cost or medicines. And we're applying that thinking to this problem as well in the U.S. as well as outside. Our goal isn't to just get an approval, but to make sure that all of the people millions in the U.S. who could qualify for it could access it on day one. So those are all inputs into that process and without throwing out a number here, which wouldn't be appropriate until we get an approval. That's how we think about it. Hopefully, that gives you some color behind the scenes. Thanks, Kevin. Thanks to Dan for answering all those questions. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in the Company, of course. We continue to see growth with our broad commercial portfolio. And we have strong momentum across our core business supported by a breadth of brands and accelerating classes and robust growth across U.S., Europe and China. In addition, as you heard today, we believe we have a compelling pipeline with industry-leading opportunities, and we remain focused on bringing new medicines to patients and creating value for all our stakeholders. Thanks again for dialing in. Please follow up with Investor Relations team if you have any questions we have not addressed today, and hope you have a great day. Thanks."

Lilly entered 2021 focused on expanding our reach to over 45 million patients by scaling our key growth brands around the world, continuing the advancement of our pipeline following a very successful 2020 and increasing productivity in the SG&A line while investing in research for sustainable long-term growth. We are pleased with the progress we've made on these objectives in our first quarter while also delivering hundreds of thousands of doses of our COVID-19 antibodies to patients to help the continued fight against COVID-19. As we unpack this quarter's results, we will attempt to give you a clear picture of the underlying trends in our core business.  We recognize this quarter was noisy, catching the increased consumer stock in from the Q1 2020 in our quarterly compare and increased COVID-19 therapy R&D spend in 2021. These items, coupled with the FX rate movement and a number of changes to U.S. government purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies throughout the quarter, make for a longer earnings call and press release. And we realize, for those keeping score on sell-side model accuracy, perhaps some disappointment. Nonetheless, underneath all of that is a strong and growing core business for Lilly and a significant number of positive, even compelling pipeline readouts in the quarter to support long-term growth across all of our core therapy areas. And we continue to expect top line growth and margin expansion to accelerate throughout this year.  This quarter, revenue grew 16% compared to Q1 2020 or 13% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume, which grew 17 percentage points. As previously highlighted in Q1 2020, we had roughly a $250 million COVID-19-related inventory build that is impacting the year-over-year comparison. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, our core business grew 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continued to drive volume and revenue growth and now represent 52% of our core business in Q1 2021.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% in Q1 and 78% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5% for the quarter and 30.1% excluding the FX impact. While foreign exchange on international inventories sold has a modest effect on our Q1 -- on our results in 2019 and 2020, in the first quarter of 2021, we experienced over 250 basis point of negative impact on our gross margin and operating margin. Recall that is purely a noncash accounting item.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our Q4 earnings call, including the Phase III initiation of pirtobrutinib, formerly known as LOXO-305; and for additional obesity studies in tirzepatide's SURMOUNT program; the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a treatment for COVID-19; positive Phase III results from tirzepatide's SURPASS-2, 3 and 5 trials in type 2 diabetes; and positive Phase III results for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and baricitinib in alopecia areata.  About a decade ago, Lilly made the decision to enter into and invest in immunology with the Phase III initiation of ixekizumab, now known as Taltz. Since then, we have added Olumiant in rheumatoid arthritis and several new indications with first or best-in-category data for Taltz and Olumiant in rheumatology and dermatology. This year, we see further expansion of our immunology strategy with the successful completion of Phase III studies of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The first IL-23p19 antibody medicine to demonstrate results in this setting.  We're also excited about lebrikizumab's potential to differentiate from Dupixent on itch, sleep and safety, primarily in conjunctivitis, in what is an increasingly large and growing class with meaningful unmet medical need. And we anticipate multiple Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab later this year in monotherapy and in combination with corticosteroids. We look forward to potentially reaching increasing numbers of patients in difficult-to-treat immunology conditions in the coming years.  We also entered into several business development deals, including the in-licensing of a RIPK1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals and the divestiture of QBREXZA, which along with lebrikizumab was part of the Dermira acquisition last year. We also distributed nearly $800 million in dividends this quarter with the share -- dividend per share increasing 15% versus last year.  Moving on to Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. We announced plans to host a webinar to provide an overview of the company's commitment in the areas of environmental, social and governance for the investment community, for media and the general public on May 4, 2021. Additionally, we announced 2 planned retirements of long-tenured executives and several additions to our leadership team. I'd like to thank Myles O'Neill, President of Lilly Manufacturing; and Melissa Barnes, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, for their leadership and service to our company. We also extend a warm welcome to Edgardo Hernandez, who will be succeeding Myles; to Alonzo Weems, who will succeed Melissa; and to Diogo Rau, who will be joining Lilly next month as Chief Information and Digital Officer, succeeding Aarti Shah, whose retirement was announced last fall.  Finally, we announced the appointment of Anat Ashkenazi, our CFO. Anat has a deep experience, having been the CFO of every part of our value chain. For the last 4 years, Anat has a large -- has led a large portion of our finance organization with all of our divisional CFOs reporting to her as well as our accounting and financial reporting team, our corporate strategy group and our business transformation office. During this time, Anat worked closely with me, our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors to develop and implement our annual business and long-term strategic plans. I have no doubt that Anat will perform extremely well as CFO of Lilly and expect no changes in our priorities, our strategy or execution, given her significant involvement in all those areas.  Anat, welcome to our leadership team, and I'll turn the call over to you for our Q1 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in the first quarter. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 16% this quarter compared to Q1 of 2020 or 7% when excluding the COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit, representing a good momentum for our core business.  Last year, with the health and safety of our employees, patients and providers in mind, we shifted from in-person interactions to primarily virtual interactions and began 2021 with few sales reps in the field in the U.S. We feel good about our capabilities to work with providers virtually and are encouraged as we exited Q1 2021 with the majority of U.S. reps back in the field. As we navigate the early stages of the recovery, we're focused on operational excellence in both virtual and in-person environment and are pleased with the volume and share growth in key brands despite continued pandemic-related headwinds for several classes.  As we look at gross margin, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 490 basis points to 75.4%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78%, a decrease of 260 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix driven largely by sales of COVID-19 antibodies and, to a lesser extent, by lower realized prices and revenue.  Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% while R&D expenses increased 21%, driven primarily by $220 million of investments in COVID-19 therapies. Net of the COVID-19 expenses, R&D increased 5%, driven by continued investments in our late-stage pipeline.  Total operating expense growth was less than 3% compared to Q1 2020 when excluding the investments in COVID-19 therapies. Operating income increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 27.5% for the quarter, a decline of 250 basis points compared to prior year. This decline was driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.  Other income and expense was income of $35 million this quarter compared to expense of $73 million in Q1 of 2020, driven primarily by a benefit related to favorable European patent settlement for Alimta. As we noted previously, beginning in 2021, we are excluding the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures and have provided revised figures for 2020 in our investor workbook to enable year-over-year comparison on that same basis.  Our effective tax rate was 10.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods was reduced by net discrete tax benefits with the larger net discrete benefit reflected in the first quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 16%.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020 while revenue decreased slightly, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Adjusting for the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, the core business grew 5% in the U.S. These results were driven entirely by volume, led by Trulicity and Taltz, partially offset by a mid-single-digit price decline.  Pricing was a 6% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, driven primarily by Taltz' improved access and corresponding higher contracted rates, partially offset by a modest list price increase. Excluding the impact of Taltz' win at ESI, we experienced low single-digit net price decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. We noted on previous calls that we expect that Taltz would experience price headwind in Q1 beyond general rate pressure with the improved access position.  There were two pieces of the ESI impact. The first existing patients already covered through medical exceptions were moved to the newly contracted rate, a onetime step-down in prices as we move through 2021. In addition, we were pleased with the update for new patients at ESI at the contracted rate and we expect that, that population will grow meaningfully over time.  There is always a near-term impact when we have a step -- a significant step-up in access. And this win nearly doubled our commercial access. We're encouraged by the volume growth we saw in the first quarter and believe Taltz will return to net sales growth in the second quarter, which should continue to accelerate as we move through the year as the volume growth from the major access upgrade outpaces the related pricing headwind.  Beyond Taltz, segment mix was not a major of U.S. price performance in the first quarter as increased utilization in the more highly rebated government segment was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment, primarily for our diabetes portfolio. While mid-term trends are stable at present, given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported net price changes. We also expect Taltz' price impact to moderate as we move through the year and overall, low to mid-single-digit total net price decline in the U.S. for the full year.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 15% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the impact of Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking, revenue grew 5% in constant currency despite lockdowns in a number of European countries and driven primarily -- entirely by volume growth for Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021.  In Japan, revenue decreased 8% in constant currency, driven entirely by decreased volume for Cialis and Forteo. Net of the impact for those post-patent expiry products, Japan grew 5% in constant currency, driven by Verzenio, Jardiance in collaboration with BI and Olumiant.  In China, revenue grew 26% in constant currency, driven by 32% volume growth, primarily from Tyvyt and, to a lesser extent, our diabetes portfolio. We're excited about the momentum in China as our business has accelerated significantly the past 2 quarters. Tyvyt continues its strong growth, Trulicity and Olumiant are now in the NRDL and we look forward to launch uptake for Verzenio. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued erosion of Cialis.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. Despite the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit impacting year-over-year growth, these newer medicines delivered over 9 percentage point of growth this quarter with COVID antibodies also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as insulin, whose volume growth was also meaningfully impacted by the Q1 2020 stocking benefit.  Slide 10 highlights the contribution of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated approximately $3.1 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 52% of core business revenue. We are particularly encouraged by Trulicity's performance. 3 years ago, Trulicity was the #2 injectable GLP-1 in the U.S. market at roughly 40% share of market. Weekly scripts for the class were approximately 180,000 and a new weekly injectable entrant had just launched. Since that time, Trulicity has become the most prescribed GLP-1 in the U.S. with a 48% share of the injectable market in a class that is now twice the size at roughly 360,000 weekly scripts.  Trulicity continues to have the highest adherence of any diabetes medication, oral or injectable, with the additional dose of 3 and 4.5 milligram providing the potential for Trulicity to both extend the time on therapy for existing patients and compete for new patients as demonstrated by the new-to-brand share of market having increased more than 4 points since the launch of these additional doses in September 2020. As we start 2021, we are pleased with Trulicity's ability to outgrow the injectable class and establish all-time highs in new therapy starts as well as total market share.  We see meaningful opportunity for continued robust class growth for GLP-1s as they are still less than 1 in 10 diabetes scripts and have significant opportunity for further penetration in the first injectable space as well. With more positive readouts from the tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes this quarter, we remain focused on sustaining Trulicity's leadership position, accelerating class growth and providing continued innovation in the incretin space.  On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1, we invested nearly $3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditure and after-tax investments in R&D. In addition, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders via dividend. We are focused on utilizing our cash flow -- our strong cash flow to develop the next wave of new medicine through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed in-licensing of the RIP kinase 1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals. We will remain active in assessing the in-licensing opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions, where we believe we can create shareholders' value and enhance our future growth prospects.  Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 12. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We continue to support health care professionals, navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccinations to enable return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. Despite some therapeutic class still at or below pre-COVID baselines for new therapy starts and the highlighted inventory impact on year-over-year growth, we are confident in the performance of our core business.  We are increasing our full year revenue outlook by $100 million to reflect the FX benefit realized on the top line in the first quarter. We are, however, narrowing the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue from approximately $1 billion to $2 billion to $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year. Based on the rollout of the vaccine across major markets, current antibody utilization rate, existing U.S. government bamlanivimab supply and the transition to only supply bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in the U.S., we believe this update range contemplates a variety of potential scenarios. We recognize that situations across the globe can evolve quickly, and we'll plan to adapt as required moving forward. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.6 billion to $27.6 billion. Our outlook for gross margin percent remains unchanged with the impact of COVID-19 antibodies diluting our total gross margin percent by approximately 100 basis points.  For research and development, we're increasing our range from $6.5 billion to $7.7 billion to $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. This reflects an increase of $100 million in COVID-19 antibody expense to support the advancement of a third antibody, LY-1404, as we continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic and approximately $300 million on the core business, driven by investments in donanemab for the expansion of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-2 study and the initiation of the new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER Alzheimer's 3 in asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients. Our investments in donanemab is consistent with our R&D strategy to continue to bolster our pipeline to ensure long-term growth, and based on the strength of the data, invest meaningfully in innovative molecules that we believe have the potential to deliver practice change in data that could significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet need.  We're increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $100 million to $200 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlement in Europe I noted earlier, while our GAAP range is now income of $150 million to $250 million, which reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first quarter. We are lowering our effective tax rate to approximately 13% to reflect higher discrete tax items in the first quarter and a lower base rate. We're lowering our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 31%. The decrease in operating margin is driven entirely by the decreased investments in Alzheimer's for donanemab. Our longer-term margin expansion remains unchanged as we expect continued operating margin expansion to mid- to high 30s. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 26%.  Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share is now $7.80 to $8. The increase on the lower end of the range reflects the net benefit for the core business related to the changes to OID and tax rate as well as increased revenue, offset by increased R&D for investments in donanemab. The reduction in the upper end of the range reflects the narrow revenue range and increased R&D expense for COVID-19 therapies. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23, which reflects an increase to acquire the IP R&D related to completed business development transactions, other specified items related primarily to asset impairments, COVID-19 inventory charges and acquisition and integration costs as well as the benefit from net gains on investments in equity securities. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while also delivering operating margin expansion in mid-teens EPS growth.  As we move forward, I would encourage you to look at trends in our core business for the first half of the year, given the significant variability we saw across the period in 2020. As a reminder, revenue performance in the second quarter of 2020 was impacted by the reversal of largely all the $250 million COVID-related stocking benefit from Q1 of 2020 as well as an additional $250 million due to the significant decline in new patient prescription as health care utilization decreased and systems temporarily closed down in the face of a surging pandemic. As we look at underlying volume and share trends across our key products, we are confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first quarter only furthers our conviction in our mid-term and long-term outlook for continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. 2021 is clearly off to a very positive start for R&D at Lilly with strong pipeline progress already and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting results from tirzepatide's first 4 top line readouts from the Phase III SURPASS program, including the strong results from SURPASS-2, the head-to-head trial with semaglutide 1 milligram. This program is aptly named as we've seen tirzepatide surpass our expectations through these initial readouts, displaying significantly greater hemoglobin A1C reduction, weight loss and percent of patients reaching normal glucose levels than any GLP-1 on the market.  On Slide 13, you can see impressive performance in the efficacy estimate analysis in glycemic control for tirzepatide with each dose demonstrating superiority in each trial across a range of patient populations, comparators and background medications. The clear highlight is the impressive A1C reduction of the 5-milligram dose across each of these 3 -- each of these different patient populations while the higher doses provide additional glucose control up to and surpassing 2.5% A1C reductions.  Moving to Slide 14. You can see how tirzepatide performed across all 3 doses in terms of patients achieving HbA1c below 5.7%, the normal glycemic level seen in people without type 2 diabetes. We believe this is an exciting finding that may reset expectations for the impact diabetes medications could have for patients. Using the efficacy estimate analysis across SURPASS-1, 2 and 3, we see about half of the patients on the 15-milligram dose of tirzepatide achieve this remarkable level of Hba1c control.  In SURPASS-5, which focused on patients on background insulin glargine, 62% of patients on 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved this level of A1C compared to only 3% of patients in the placebo group. Remember, this is a patient population on background basal insulin with an average duration of diabetes of over 13 years. Achieving this level of glucose control in such a population is something that prior to GIP/GLP-1 agonists like tirzepatide, we did not even contemplate as possible.  On Slide 15, we show the efficacy estimate analysis for weight reduction across the 4 studies. Here again, we see levels of efficacy that previously were thought unobtainable with incretin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients. As we and others have discussed, studies like AWARD-11 and SUSTAIN FORTE have begun to show the limit of what fully hitting the GLP-1 mechanism can accomplish for weight loss and A1C. There appear to be diminishing returns as doses of GLP-1 alone fully saturate the GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism and a flattening of the dose response curve occurs.  And then you look at this slide, including importantly, SURPASS-2. And you can see quite clearly that there's something different going on here as the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist is beyond the flattening of the dose response curve of GLP-1 performance, which we believe evidences the power of adding in the GIP mechanisms. Highlights from these studies include the 15-milligram dose delivering 14% weight reduction in SURPASS-3, noting here weight gain of 3% on insulin degludec comparator, the 15-milligram dose nearly doubling the weight reduction of semaglutide 1-milligram in SURPASS-2 and strong performance from the 5 and 10-milligram doses with statistically superior weight loss, even as high as 11% on the 10-milligram dose versus placebo or active comparators.  We're encouraged that in these 40 and 52-week studies, we haven't yet seen the weight loss curves plateau on the higher doses. It's really exciting to think about how tirzepatide could potentially perform with the longer duration of treatment that we'll see in future studies. We had a lot of confidence in the efficacy data coming out of Phase II. But there was a lot we didn't yet know about safety and tolerability. Recall, for example, that the primary Phase II trial had only about 200 patients on therapy and patients were only on therapy for 26 weeks.  As we look at Slide 16, we've been pleased to see through these 4 SURPASS readouts that the overall safety profile was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class and the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related and mild to moderate in severity. We're particularly encouraged by the potential impact of the optimized dose escalation scheme, and accordingly, by the tolerability profile observed in the Phase III program, which improved greatly in comparison to Phase II, including the lower rates of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that we've seen, consistent with what we saw in Phase III studies for other well-tolerated and highly used incretin therapies, including our own Trulicity. In addition, we're pleased with the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, which have ranged from 3% to 11% across doses in these studies.  Stepping back from the data a bit, we're excited about the safety and efficacy results across all doses, but perhaps especially so for the efficacy of the 5-milligram dose, which has performed well in each study, including showing superiority to semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2 on both A1C reduction and weight loss. I think these data show that the 5-milligram dose could be a great first incretin that can potentially deliver best-in-class efficacy with tolerability that is as good or better than other leading incretins. So we have the low maintenance dose of 5 milligrams that, if approved, could potentially be appropriate for many patients with physicians knowing they could have higher doses available as they continue management of disease.  Tirzepatide could provide patients with the opportunity to set treatment goals that might surpass what was previously thought possible in type 2 diabetes, both in terms of getting patients to normal glucose control, which has never been contemplated as a potential treatment goal, as well as for impressive weight loss with the highest dose of tirzepatide having roughly double the weight loss of semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2. Today, type 2 diabetes is largely a treat-to-fail disease.  With these results, tirzepatide, if approved, could potentially provide doctors options to enable early control of glucose and weight. This has the potential to translate to improved levels of end organ protection and a more meaningful reduction in disease complications that has yet been seen. We'll be testing this potential for tirzepatide in ongoing and planned studies in diabetes, obesity, heart failure and NASH. Accordingly, we've now initiated SURMOUNTs-2, 3 and 4 for tirzepatide in obesity and top line results from SURMOUNT-1 are expected next year.  Moving back to diabetes. The top line readout for SURPASS-4, which is in a high cardiovascular risk population and we believe will provide an important contribution to our CV safety assessment, is the gating trial for global submissions in type 2 diabetes. Completion of this trial has always been contingent on accruing a prespecified number of CV events. We've achieved the necessary events, which triggers bringing patients in for final treatment and safety visits before moving the trial to completion. Based on this update, we anticipate a top line readout by the middle of this year. We look forward to disclosing the results of SURPASS-1, 2, 3 and 5 at the ADA 2021 Virtual Meeting, which will include a 90-minute ADA symposium featuring these results the morning of June 29.  While we're excited with the progress of tirzepatide, we think innovation in the incretin space is not over. At ADA, we'll also be discussing preclinical and Phase I data for our glucagon/GLP/GIP triagonist, also known as GGG, which we're pleased to announce we'll be moving into Phase II later this quarter. We've previously commented that in this space, we have a high bar for progressing molecules in development, one that has been raised recently by tirzepatide. While it's still early, we're advancing GGG to Phase II based on our belief that it could exceed the benefits seen with tirzepatide. With our GGG molecule, we expect to see even more weight loss than what can be achieved with tirzepatide while preserving glucose-lowering efficacy. In addition, due to glucagon's direct action on the liver, we'd also hope to see benefits in NASH. Consequently, our ambitious Phase II program is designed to evaluate GGG for obesity, type 2 diabetes and NASH.  In addition to our next-generation incretins, we're also very excited by our novel weekly insulin, basal insulin-Fc. Thanks to Lilly's work on Trulicity, weekly incretin therapy is now the standard of care in the GLP-1 space. And together with tirzepatide, we hope incretin-based therapies will become the standard of care in the first injectable space for people with type 2 diabetes. For those people who need basal insulin therapy in addition to their incretin therapy, we'd like to make weekly insulin therapy possible, ultimately avoiding daily injections completely. We'll give an update at ADA on our novel weekly basal insulin. We plan to have an investor call in the morning of July 1 to discuss the data releases at ADA for tirzepatide, GGG and weekly basal insulin.  While the progress in our diabetes portfolio is compelling, Lilly has continued to advance the rest of our pipeline this quarter. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 23 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. In addition to the progress on tirzepatide I just discussed, major developments since our last earnings call include progress with donanemab on multiple fronts. In terms of data, we presented detailed results at AD/PD showing donanemab met its primary endpoint, significantly slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo on the integrated Alzheimer's disease rating scale, a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. And data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline with ranges between 20% and 40% in all secondary endpoints with nominal statistical significance at multiple time points compared to placebo.  On the clinical front, as we discussed in detail on our call last month, we expanded TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 to be a Phase III study, and it's now enrolling quickly. And today, we're announcing that we will start a new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. This trial is anticipated to begin enrollment later this year. Our goal here is to enroll patients who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have any clinical symptoms. The study will have development and progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms as the primary endpoint. And we anticipate it will take approximately 3 years from completion of enrollment to reach a sufficient number of events. We'll be testing if a short course of donanemab treatment at the start of the trial can prevent progression in a substantial fraction of patients over the subsequent several years. These types of trials are extremely challenging to enroll and conduct. But here, we're buoyed by our expertise in biomarkers, including both PET scans and importantly, our plasma P-tau217 assay.  On the regulatory front, based on feedback from the FDA, we currently do not see a path forward for near-term submission and approval based on the first TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study alone. As you know, the unmet need in Alzheimer's disease is significant. So while we remain focused on speeding up enrollment and completion of our second pivotal study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, we are continuing to actively engage with the FDA and are fully exploring any opportunities for early submission.  Another highlight this quarter was the initiation of pirtobrutinib\u2019s Phase III program with study start in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as monotherapy. We're also proud of the continuation of our work against COVID-19, including a planned transition from bamlanivimab alone to the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S., accomplished by first gaining Emergency Use Authorization for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in February and then our request for revocation of the EUA for bamlanivimab alone, which FDA subsequently granted.  We also submitted bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for regulatory review in Europe. And we initiated the evaluation of bamlanivimab with VIR-7831 in collaboration with Vir and GSK as well as started trials with a new, potentially broadly neutralizing antibody, LY-1404, in collaboration with AbCellera in case new combinations are needed to fight variants. We announced top line Phase III results evaluating baricitinib on top of standard of care, which did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint for treatment of COVID-19 but did result in a significant reduction of death from any cause by 38% by day 28. And baricitinib received regulatory approval in conjunction with remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 in Japan.  Our work on tirzepatide, donanemab and pirtobrutinib brings great potential for patients in the long term and is highly prioritized at Lilly. Our work on COVID-19 is another clear highlight, where we moved quickly to help address an unmet medical need in the midst of a pandemic. We're optimistic though that this need will wane in the coming years. Beyond these significant efforts, there's been progress across many other commercial stage and clinical stage assets.  Starting in oncology, we're pleased with the approval of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer in Europe. We're also pleased that the results of monarchE, our adjuvant breast cancer study, are now submitted in Japan, along with Europe, China and the U.S. As you know, the primary endpoint for the study was invasive disease-free survival, which we hit at the interim analysis. As anticipated, this hazard ratio continues to strengthen over time as more events have accrued. Important secondary endpoints for the study include distant relapse-free survival and overall survival.  For the U.S. submission, the FDA has noted, and we agree, that the OS data are immature and thus unreliable as we shared in the JCO publication last year. FDA has, therefore, asked us to see an updated OS analysis during the review cycle to determine that OS is trending in favor of Verzenio. Given the robust distant relapse-free survival data, we're highly confident that the overall survival data will eventually reflect and reinforce the survival benefit. But it takes time for these events to accrue, especially in the adjuvant setting.  In immunology, we have positive Phase III readouts for baricitinib in alopecia areata, a disease with significant unmet medical need, and we look forward to regulatory submissions starting in the second half of this year. We also announced that the FDA extended the review period for baricitinib for atopic dermatitis by 3 months, another disease where we think JAK inhibition could potentially alleviate important unmet medical needs.  With mirikizumab, we reported positive Phase III results in ulcerative colitis in the 12-week induction study, hitting the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to seeing the maintenance data early next year. We also have updates to mirikizumab psoriasis program. While the OASIS program generated positive results with safety and efficacy similar to other IL-23p19s, we believe the psoriasis market is well served with highly effective treatment options, including Taltz.  Lilly's immunology strategy is to focus our new molecules and indications on areas where patients have significant unmet needs, not merely adding new options or leveraging commercial presence to create a space, where effective solutions like Taltz already exist for patients. Therefore, we will not pursue submission of mirikizumab in psoriasis, but instead, we'll focus our efforts on the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease indications, where unmet medical need is higher and where we believe the potential of the IL-23p19 mechanism to create a new standard of care is greater.  In addition to late-stage progress, our early-stage portfolio continues to advance with the introduction of 5 new Phase I assets and the attrition of 2. In addition to the progress we've made in just the first few months of the year, we anticipate important developments for the remainder of 2021, including the final readout for tirzepatide's Phase III type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS-4, noted earlier; Phase III results for Jardiance in HFpEF and for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; regulatory actions for Jardiance for HFrEF, Verzenio in the adjuvant setting for ER-positive breast cancer, baricitinib for atopic dermatitis and tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain, where we previously noted our disappointment in the outcome of the Tanezumab Advisory Committee; the presentation of Phase I data for our oral SERD; the initiation of Phase I for a BCL-2 inhibitor and for KRAS G12C inhibitor; along with the filing of an IND for our next-generation RET inhibitor later this year as we announced at AACR; and the Phase II readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's disease.  We believe our continued pipeline success drives increasing visibility to meaningful long-term growth, and we look forward to continued progress across our portfolio in the coming quarters.  Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made to start the year. Amid several moving pieces in a challenging health care environment, we are excited by the momentum we are seeing. Our business grew 16% in the first quarter with the core business growing 7%, adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue and last year's COVID-19-related inventory stocking benefit. Our top line growth continues to be strong, driven strongly by volume across our key growth products, which account for more than half of our core business.  Net of the significant impact from foreign exchange on international inventories sold, our operating margin was in line with our expectations as we continue to expect operating margin expansion throughout the year and further expansion in years to come. We made significant progress developing new medicines with many more data readouts expected this year. Advances for tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, Verzenio, mirikizumab, Retevmo and Olumiant, serve as a reminder of the breadth and depth of opportunities we have to sustain robust long-term growth. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders, being increased dividend, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.  I want to say thank you to my Lilly teammates, whose commitment to excellence and dedication to our purpose of bringing innovative new medicines to patients is inspiring and drove these accomplishments amidst ongoing pandemic headwinds. While our people, health care providers and patients continue to face near-term challenges associated with COVID-19, our long-term outlook is as bright as ever.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. [Operator Instructions]. Toni, can you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session? And then we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: I've just got two on the pipeline. I guess, first, on Verzenio, did I hear that you mentioned FDA is looking for updated OS data as part of the review? So I was just wondering when you'll have that data. And does that push out approval timelines in any meaningful way that we need to think about?  And then the second one I had was on tirzepatide. I guess, in light of the data you've seen from the SURPASS studies, does that -- has that changed how you think about what patient populations you'll focus on from a commercial standpoint or your go-to-market strategy? And I guess, as part of that, as we think about tirzepatide coming to market, do you expect substantial switches from Trulicity? Or is tirzepatide growth more about new patient starts and kind of expanding the market?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Anne for the Verzenio question and then Mike on tirzepatide.\nAnne White: Well, thanks, Chris, for the question on Verzenio. And so we will be delivering this data set to the FDA without delaying our standard review timing. We can't really comment on what the FDA will do with the data or the application, but these discussions are progressing as planned. Important to note, as the data matures, I think, as Dan said, given the strength of the DRFS hazard ratio, remember, it was a 0.687 haz ratio with a very strong p-value, we are highly confident that the OS will trend in favor of Verzenio. So really, what we believe we're discussing is when that will occur.  So obviously, as I said, we can't comment on the discussion with FDA, but we do look forward to working with them on bringing this medicine to patients. And maybe just a comment to reference how immature this data is. At the time of the interim analysis that we published in JCO late last year, there were 39 deaths in the abema arm and 37 in the control arm. So that makes it really challenging to interpret this data when there's over 5,000 patients in the study. Thanks for the question.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Chris, thanks for your question. No, the tirzepatide results have not changed the way we want to position tirzepatide in the marketplace. Obviously very pleased with those results. We're also just really blessed to have both Trulicity and tirzepatide. Our goal will be to maximize our entire incretin portfolio. Trulicity has established a strong market position. And I think the best data to support that is just how we've been able to grow share of market in the face of Ozempic and Rybelsus. So it has a strong position in the marketplace and that will remain.  But now as we think about tirzepatide, the dual incretin mechanism, that GIP component is really a game changer. Dan went through the results, but we just haven't seen the ability to return to someone living with type 2 diabetes, whether they're late or early, someone with type 2 diabetes progression, back to normal A1C. In fact, we were able to get 50% to 60% people back, it\u2019s really incredible. Also weight loss at the highest dose, up to 14%. So when you just take a look at that and you take a look at the fact that 90% of people who live with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, they can really benefit from early treatment with type 2 diabetes.  So the real question is why would you want to put them on something else early on? And why would you want to wait for them to have those benefits? So we see tirzepatide has the potential to really transform the market, driving earlier use of incretin, in particular tirzepatide's dual mechanism, and really expand the incretin market. So I think tirzepatide will clearly win some new patients that would have went on to Trulicity. You have some people who were maybe not performing well or not -- or needed more efficacy that will go on to tirzepatide. But clearly, our focus will be to profoundly change and disrupt the type 2 diabetes marketplace by driving earlier use of incretins with tirzepatide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Also have two pipeline ones. Just want to get your perspective on mirikizumab, the decision to focus on just IBD. You have good head-to-head data in psoriasis. So is it more of a commercial focus? Or is it that you want to focus more on Taltz and psoriasis? And then in Alzheimer's, you'll have zagotenemab data in the second half of this year. How are you thinking about the opportunity to combine potentially with donanemab? I wasn't sure what steps need to happen prior to thinking about that type of trial? And maybe from a regulatory perspective, what do you think would be a gating factor?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Geoff. We'll go to Ilya for the first question and then Dan for the question on Alzheimer's.\nIlya Yuffa: Great. Geoff, thank you for the question. On mirikizumab, really as we see the greatest opportunity for unmet need for patients and we've said all along, we believe that mirikizumab has the greatest opportunity in GI, in IBD, in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We were pleased with the LUCENT-1 results. And so we're looking forward to seeing the maintenance data at the early part of next year.  In terms of psoriasis, as we take a look at the market and unmet need, we do continue to believe that Taltz is the gold standard and best in disease and believe that really is a market well served. And so the decision from a portfolio standpoint is to focus our efforts in places where we believe we can have the greatest unmet need. And GI is where we're focused for mirikizumab.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ilya. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question on zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody. Before I come to combinations, maybe I'd just handicap this Phase II trial quickly. The pro here in favor of tau is clearly genetic validation and pathologic validation of the target. It's a great target for Alzheimer's disease. The cons here that we have to acknowledge is data from other companies' tau antibodies, which hasn't been particularly promising, and the difficulty in hitting the tau target in the brain. Now we have a differentiated antibody here that binds just aggregated tau, so perhaps there's reason to think we could get different results.  We're certainly eagerly awaiting those data in the second half of the year. And you're exactly right, if we see efficacy, combination would be an important consideration here. For sure, the general theme of combining an anti-amyloid drug with an anti-tau drug is a good one, particularly when you have a drug like donanemab, where you can completely clear amyloid plaques with a limited duration of therapy and then perhaps at that moment, intervene with an anti-tau drug. I do think that's the future. It's something we're actively considering, pending, of course, data on the tau antibody.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vamil Divan with Mizuho Securities.\nVamil Divan: Maybe one on Taltz. Maybe just a little more clarity or color on the pricing dynamics there. You mentioned you're kind of expecting a return to net sales growth in the second quarter and then accelerating. I'm just trying to think about it as we think about the full year dynamics. I don't know if you'll give product-level guidance. But how do you think about sort of the kind of full year comparison for 2021 to 2020? I assume you're still expecting growth for the year as a whole, but if you could just sort of clarify. And is that contract with ESI, I'm not sure, is that a full year contract? Or does that go beyond 1 year? I'm just trying to get a sense of sort of pricing dynamics in 2022 and 2023 and if we should expect another step-down. And then one quick follow-up just on the comments around TRAILBLAZER-3. I don't know if you can maybe just share a little more in terms of the number of patients you're looking to enroll in that trial, just so we can kind of get a sense of how long the enrollment might actually take.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Vamil. We'll go to Ilya for the question on Taltz and kind of the full year picture and then Dan on TRAILBLAZER-3.\nIlya Yuffa: Sure. So on Taltz, first, let me just say we're really pleased about the progress we're making on Taltz and the growth that we're seeing with the step-up in access upgrades, ESI and beyond. And so as we take a look, even though that we've had some price impact in Q1, there are some elements there where we have a number of patients that were on medical exception that are now in the rebated contract that we have with ESI. Of course, we're also seeing an increase in overall volumes with ESI. What's encouraging is that we're not only seeing improvements in overall volume based off of switches, we're also seeing significant improvement in our new therapy starts.  And so we're, in dermatology, now the leading share in dermatology with over 19% share. And then in rheumatology, we're almost doubling our share from previous year. And so as we think about the year in terms of growth, we do believe we'll get to net sales growth in Q2, and we'll continue to accelerate that volume growth throughout the year. The contracting that we have for Taltz is -- goes beyond 1 year. And so we're encouraged about the volume growth of over 20% now, and we continue to see encouraging signs in the market.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ilya. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Vamil, for the question on TRAILBLAZER-3 and our enrollment goals here. We probably don't get into too many details here, but we are, of course, expecting to -- this to be a large trial involving thousands of individuals, but yet we also set very ambitious enrollment goals. And while we don't have all the details planned out on how to achieve this, our goal is that we should be able to enroll this trial in about a year. That's pretty exciting to contemplate.  And Alzheimer's prevention trial is something that makes great sense, given the science and the biology here and what we know about the onset of Alzheimer's disease and its relation to years of having amyloid plaque in the brain. But there have been 2 major drawbacks that have not made these trials really very practical. First is finding the patients. That has gone from impossible before our introduction of amyloid PET scan to possible but really hard with amyloid PET scans as we experienced firsthand in the A4 trial to now something that's eminently feasible with our advent of the plasma tau -- phospho-tau217 assay. That's a huge advance that just unlocks this trial.  The second is if you think about this population, which is not experiencing symptoms, is a bit younger than an Alzheimer's population and introducing a therapy that is likely an infusion that they take for the rest of their lives, that's also a pretty significant hurdle. Again, we've, I think, abrogated that risk with donanemab in a limited treatment duration to give lasting plaque clearance, so excited about the TRAILBLAZER-3 trial.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seamus Fernandez with Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: So just, first off, a question for Dave. Dave, as you think about some of the various proposals that are in Congress currently, could you just give us your thoughts on the tax proposal? And maybe Anat could give a little bit of the potential implications for Lilly. And then separately, there's obviously a lot of controversy swelling on drug pricing. Just wanted to get your sense of the proposals that are out there currently and if the industry is poised to or ready to step up with a more reasonable proposal.  And then just the second question is on the JAK inhibitor space and Lilly's opportunity with lebrikizumab, particularly in atopic dermatitis. There's a bit of a compare and contrast. Only Lilly, I think, has both potential opportunities in this space. I think there's a lot of speculation that there is going to be a safety update from the FDA, if not a full safety panel. Hoping, Dan, that you could give us a little bit of your thoughts in that regard.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus, lots to unpack there. We'll start with Dave on some of the policy, maybe Anat on the tax piece of that. And then we'll go to Ilya on kind of what he sees from a JAK and lebrikizumab standpoint.\nDavid Ricks: Yes, Seamus. Look, on tax, this is a live discussion, of course, because the president has introduced a number of ideas on corporate tax changes. I guess we join a growing chorus of large companies who oppose, that means to raise revenue, especially when the stated policy goal of the infrastructure plan is to build back the economy. Of course, private money and corporate actions make up the vast majority of the investment that could or would occur. And taxing that seems like a bad idea, maybe the opposite idea from the bill itself.  Within the bill, maybe just a couple of general comments, and we can follow up if we need to. There's the nominal rate discussion, which, of course, when we say moving from 21% to 28% is moving toward the middle of the pack, is not true because, of course, in the U.S., we have state-level income tax. It would really put the U.S. at the highest developed economy in terms of corporate tax rate.  Additionally, we're the only major economy that taxes overseas earnings of its domiciled companies and changing the so-called GILTI tax, foreign minimum tax, really is punitive to our home companies in multiple ways and is something that would have a disproportionate effect on pharmaceutical companies. And so both these actions don't make a lot of sense to us and we oppose. We would favor things like looking at funding the IRS, so they can collect taxes from all the people that don't pay, including businesses and other items that could be pay-fors, we certainly support infrastructure in many ways.  On drug pricing, this has been pushed out a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if we see HR 3 being debated soon, but as you may have read, apparently it won't be part of the second package from the White House. That's good because HR 3 and those concepts are really set to take a huge piece out of the industry, do nothing for patient out-of-pocket affordability and really derail the innovation machine that is the only reason we're escaping from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we will oppose that with every ounce of our being as pharma.  That said, we are all for changes to the system that make out-of-pocket costs go down for patients. There are a lot of ways to do this within the system that the industry is willing to put pay-fors on the table. This is much more around the contours of maybe what we saw with Senate Finance or the reported proposals made in the 11th hour of the last administration. We will table those ideas. We are tabling those ideas. And I think probably in the second half, you'll hear more about that.  We think there's a great opportunity to improve affordability and strengthen the health care system and really address health care inequities as well that occur because people who are of lower economic means, people of color, women are disproportionately affected by bad insurance design and bad benefit design. We can shore those up and make the health care system work better for everyone.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Ilya?\nIlya Yuffa: Yes. Seamus, so thank you for the question. As you noted and what we said on the call is that we're quite excited about our progress in immunology as a whole. And if we think about the growth opportunities within immunology, atopic dermatitis is one catalyst for the company, both in what we believe in Olumiant's success but also lebrikizumab. In terms of the question around JAKs and FDA decision, I won't speculate on any decision the FDA may make. But it's safe to say that the delay across all JAKs in atopic dermatitis and other indications suggests that there's a broader review on JAK safety. We feel that Olumiant has a robust safety profile. And with dermatology being more safety conscious, we do believe that Olumiant has a very good prospect to compete in this space, especially after topical failure.  And then lebrikizumab is one to watch out for, for the second half of the year. As we get more data, well, we feel like we can compete and differentiate versus Dupixent. And so long-term prospect and catalysts for growth are very good for having both mechanisms. And we also see catalyst for growth in alopecia areata, a very -- to be first in disease with Olumiant. And so we feel very good about our chances to not only compete but also to have significant growth and have meaningful outcomes for patients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So first question I had for you was on lebrikizumab. What do you think will differentiate your products from others that are already approved and those in development? And do you plan to pursue lebrikizumab for any other indications? And then second question is on LOXO-305 plus LOXO-338. What do you think your competitive advantages are here versus others that are trying to do the same thing?\nKevin Hern: Great. Thanks, Louise. We'll go to Ilya for the first question and Jake for the second.\nIlya Yuffa: Yes. Louise, thank you for the question about lebrikizumab. In terms of area differentiation, the focus for lebrikizumab is not only to look at the efficacy on skin but also one of the more impactful symptoms related to atopic dermatitis is itch. And so we believe we may have the opportunity to differentiate an itch, which also has impact on sleep. And we believe that lebrikizumab may have a better safety profile. So that's where we believe we can differentiate. And so we're excited to get the results for lebrikizumab at the back half of the year. In terms of new indications, I think it's early to take a look at any new indications. We're obviously evaluating opportunities to grow lebrikizumab. But our full focus right now is making sure we have success in atopic dermatitis.\nDavid Ricks: Ilya, just to jump in on top of that, of course, there will be a dosing convenience and dosing certainty benefit with lebri as well.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. Jake?\nJacob Van Naarden: Thanks for the question, Louise, about pirtobrutinib, LOXO-305 and LOXO-338, the BCL-2 inhibitor. I think as it relates to differentiation, I'd point out a few things. First off, obviously, as I think you and others know, pirtobrutinib itself is a differentiated BTK inhibitor that we believe affords certain advantages in combination. Obviously, we need to prove that clinically, but that's our hypothesis right now. So that sort of stands on its own. The LOXO-338 program, the BCL-2 inhibitor, we'll be putting into the clinic this year. And obviously, important that, that drug meets its human pharmacology goals so that we know that it itself is on track as a drug. Should that prove to be the case, which we expect it to, we will then look to combine these 2 agents.  I think when you look out at others that are combining BTK and BCL-2, the latter largely being venetoclax, I think what you see is a very fragmented landscape of asset ownership across companies, and as a result of that, some -- oftentimes perverse incentives about how to combine those drugs and where. We think it's important that if you have a new and differentiated BTK inhibitor like we believe we do with pirtobrutinib, we thought it was strategically important to own our own BCL-2 inhibitor. And so we think we'll be really the only player in the field who owns both agents outright. So that, to us, is a key differentiating feature downstream. But it's still a bunch of hoops we have to jump through to enable that combination.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Carter Gould with Barclays.\nCarter Gould: All right. I guess, first, for Dan or Mike, you guys posted details of the SUMMIT study of tirzepatide and HFpEF recently. And I think the design, size and time line were all surprising relative to expectations, so I guess getting to a readout much faster than some have had expected. Can you maybe just walk through some of those key design choices and the extent regulators have bought in, and also confirm that that single study would be sufficient for approval in that setting? And then also historically, Lilly has done a -- I think, done a better job of sort of franchise building in certain areas than some of its peers. Now with sort of mirikizumab derisking data, can you talk around how you're thinking about building around the GI portfolio?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Carter. We'll go to Mike for the question on tirzepatide and Ilya for the question on miri.\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question on the SUMMIT trial. We're bullish on the opportunity for tirzepatide in HFpEF. When you look at that, it's really a large unmet need with nearly 4 million people living with HFpEF heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization in the U.S. When you look at it scientifically, you do see that there is a BC-related HFpEF phenotype that we believe that tirzepatide can play a large role in helping out. And so that's what really drove our investment in SUMMIT. And I think the team has done a nice job of coming up with a creative approach that will provide, I think, robust data for payers and clinicians to make that decision. So I think we're very confident in this -- in both our clinical trial design as well as the commercial opportunity.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. We'll go to Ilya for the next answer.\nIlya Yuffa: Sure. Yes, Carter, listen, as you noted, in terms of building franchises across immunology, we've built up our scale in dermatology and excited about increasing number of treatments there, the same with rheumatology in the hope for finding lupus as well. And then in GI, mirikizumab will be our first entrant into GI with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. And then we do have a pretty robust pipeline in both Phase I and proof-of-concept studies, in particular, IL-2 conjugate that we're studying for ulcerative colitis as well. And we look forward to bringing out new treatments across all three of those areas in the coming years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.\nTim Anderson: A couple of questions. On Verzenio and the CDK class more broadly. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the U.S. in terms of rebating for this oral oncology category? My understanding is that the level of rebates may be stepping up. And I'm not sure which company or companies are driving that. Maybe it's Pfizer driving that as they try to hang on to market share. But what's the outlook for gross-to-net price trends in this category?  And then on Tyvyt, your PD-1 from Innovent, a Chinese company, you note that you'll file for approval in non-small cell lung in the U.S. this year. It's really hard for me to see how you gain any share with this product, given what would be a limited label and given payer and prescriber dynamics, where in things like Part B, you can't really compete on price. So what's realistic to expect with this product from a commercial perspective, not only U.S. but another Western markets like Europe?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Tim. We'll go to Anne White for both of those.\nAnne White: Well, thanks, Tim, for the question on Verzenio. So I think, as you're mentioning, it's an incredibly competitive market with the CDK4/6s. And so we and others continue to do what we need to do to make sure that patients get access to the right medicines. So we have obviously a strong strategy there. I can't comment on the specifics, but we do see competition. And really, what we're seeing -- I think you're seeing in Verzenio, what we're seeing is an incredibly nice trend growing in Q1.  As you saw, we had positive momentum with the U.S. strong share growth in March and we saw TRx of over 17% and NBRx of over 28%, so -- and this is despite, as you've noticed, a modest year-on-year TRx market decline. So I think what we're seeing is both from a payer strategy but also very much from a data strategy, we're seeing that Verzenio is growing its share nicely. And so I like how all of our different programs are coming together.  And obviously, the data in AZURE breast cancer reinforce the growing awareness that these medicines are different. But what really has been the focus for our execution has been capitalizing on positive OS data and making sure that people are aware of that and we're seeing more trial, more adoption as we go through that. So very pleased how all of our strategies with Verzenio are coming together.  On Tyvyt, yes, I mean, as you mentioned, it's a competitive space, obviously. And while I can't really comment on our commercial strategy prior to approval, you can be reassured that we're looking at ways to differentiate and really add value to this innovative class of medicines. So obviously, we know that there's certain commercial approaches we'll have to take to capture share as really a late entrant in the field, but we see opportunity here.  And obviously, this deal made sense with the partnership that we've had with Innovent and we're committed to the U.S. submission this year. And so more to come as we look to launch the product and share that strategy and how we intend to make an opportunity here. But as you said, I wouldn't assess this as a large opportunity for Lilly, but an opportunistic one that we think makes sense, it makes sense for patients globally and driving value for them.\nKevin Hern: We'll move to the lightning round, so we can try to get everyone in. [Operator Instructions].\nOperator: Next, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.\nAndrew Baum: Yes, a question for Dan on Verzenio and the monarchE filing. As you outlined, the survival data is thankfully going to take a long time to mature. Is the answer that the FDA is looking for more about further maturation of progression-free survival or -- sorry, disease-free survival? Just given the historic precedence of the PENELOPE-B data with palbociclib, where you have separation that then coming together, isn't that really what the FDA wants, given if you're waiting for survival, you could be waiting for a very long time indeed?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: I'll just take it quickly. No, Andrew, it's -- the focus here is on the overall survival. On the distant relapse-free survival, as we commented, the curves are not coming together, they're actually separating more. It's improving as we get more events. So I'm not aware of any concerns around that.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.\nStephen Scala: I think it was stated that the number of CV events in SURPASS-4 has been reached, if I heard that correctly. If that's correct, then it looks like the study is going to achieve its endpoint earlier than expected. So my question is, is that either confidence-building or concerning? Are you worried COVID-19 cardiovascular effects may have impacted the accrual of events? And if tirzepatide trends worse than insulin glargine, can you still file?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We'll go to Mike on that.\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. No, we have no concerns. We will -- we have reached the number we needed to complete the trial. We're getting patients back in. We'll have that data, should start to see top line in May, and we'll release that information in -- before the end of the quarter. We're very, very excited about tirzepatide and very confident in its CV profile. I'm looking forward to seeing the SURPASS-4 data.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.\nTerence Flynn: I was just wondering on monarchE, if there's any possibility of an NCCN listing before the FDA action? And then can you give us an update on the Retevmo launch dynamics this quarter?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Terence. We'll go to Anne for the question on Verzenio and Retevmo.\nAnne White: Thanks for the question. So on monarchE and NCCN, I really can't comment for them. So obviously, we feel that this data is incredibly impactful. I think one of our thought leaders call it the most notable development in HER2-positive breast cancer in the last 2 decades, but we'll just have to wait and see what NCCN decides to do.  And then on Retevmo, the launch is going well. So we had a virtual launch in May, we finished 2020 with $37 million in sales, and we see positive momentum in Q1. So we've had a great engagement with customers. Unaided brand awareness is strong. So we're quite pleased. And this is an incredibly important medicine, as you know, in some patients, over an 80% response rate, so great response from the customers. I'm very enthusiastic about what we're seeing so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronny Gal with Bernstein.\nAaron Gal: So we are seeing you adopting cost-conscious strategies on both Taltz and on mirikizumab. And I was kind of wondering, if you're going to look forward 5 years, where do you see immunology pricing then goes in terms of dollars for you? It's right now in the low to mid-30s, the way we can see it. 5 years here from now, are we going be in the mid-20s, under 20, 30-plus? Where do you see the band of pricing looking like?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Ronny. We'll go to Ilya for questions on immunology pricing trends.\nIlya Yuffa: Yes. Ronny, thanks for the question on immunology. In terms of our focus, it's -- let's not -- conscious is more related to looking at opportunities for growth. We have a long runway for Taltz. And so we do believe that Taltz is kind of at the foundation of our immunology strategy. We have numerous head-to-head studies in real world evidence to suggest that Taltz is a best-in-disease treatment. And as part of our growth strategy looking at mirikizumab in GI, we do believe that within the next 5 to 10 years, we can, across multiple mechanisms in those 3 specialized groups, dermatology, rheumatology and GI, have significant growth and become a top-tier immunology company. In terms of pricing, I think it's -- they're all very competitive fields. And so our goal is to have great evidence and create access opportunities for patients that need these treatments.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Kerry Holford with Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: Just on the COVID antibodies, I wonder if you can just discuss the disconnect between your lower 2021 term guidance and the higher associated R&D spend. And with that context, do you have a budget cap in mind for your ongoing COVID investments?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Kerry. We'll go to Anat for that.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Sure. Thanks, Kerry. Let me start with the budget. So we did increase our guidance for the COVID antibody investment from $300 million to $400 million to $400 million to $500 million. And the investments that we've announced this morning is really to address the growth in variants that we see globally and looking at additional antibodies that could address that. The lowering on the high end of the range, really it relates to the changes you've seen here in the U.S. government as well as what we see globally in terms of progression of the disease, but -- and this is one I know that is more challenging to forecast, given that there's not a lot of TRx data or data for you to look at, and we'll continue to update obviously with every quarter.\nDavid Ricks: And maybe just to add as a mindset thing, we didn't get into this because we were thinking about margins or business profile, it was to be useful during the pandemic, which is still going on, obviously, raging in other parts of the world. One other driver for the top line is that increasingly, we'll be selling our products into lower-priced markets or giving it away because that's where the disease is. And when the pandemic period ends, I think we can then take a different look at this enduring business, but we're not there yet. So we're making the investments we need to, to be useful and selling the product where it's needed at the price structure we had previously announced, which is heavily discounted in low GDP markets.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Umer Raffat with Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Dan, last we spoke in mid-March, it seems like you hadn't had a lot of regulatory discussions on donanemab, but it does feel like you've had them now. So I'm curious, the FDA feedback on the new endpoint, iADRS, as well as the Bayesian analysis. And also very briefly, on CD73, there's an interesting emerging signal in some of the other CD73s in pancreatic setting. I noticed you guys discontinued, would love to find out any additional color.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Umer. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, sure. So FDA feedback is -- has been continuing, I should say. We had some and it continues to come. I think our view here is unchanged. We previously said that the FDA has concerns around iADRS because it combines cognition and function. And there's always a risk that you could have a positive signal on iADRS driven by cognition with no benefit on function or function going the other way or vice versa. And that wouldn't be acceptable for approval of a new drug. So that's the risk there. On the CD73 Phase I termination, I don't have additional comments.\nOperator: And last question comes from Gilbert with Truist Securities.\nGregory Gilbert: Dan, on tanezumab, is the outlook any more hopeful than the optics of the AdCom vote? And can you comment on where pain fits into your overall R&D priority list at this point?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Sure. Gregg, thanks for the question. Pain is still a really important unmet medical need. Clearly, the regulatory bar is high here in terms of safety. And we saw that from the Tanezumab Advisory Committee meeting, which was a pretty decisive outcome there and one that we were disappointed in.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Gregg, thanks for your question. Back to Dave for the close.\nDavid Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. 2021 has been -- has begun with good momentum in our underlying business. We remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. As we continue to scale our diverse commercial portfolio, complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.  Thanks again for dialing in today. Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we have not addressed on today's call. Hope everyone has a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conferencing Service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 7 summarizes our non-GAAP financial performance in the first quarter. As Dave mentioned, revenue increased 16% this quarter compared to Q1 of 2020 or 7% when excluding the COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit, representing a good momentum for our core business.  Last year, with the health and safety of our employees, patients and providers in mind, we shifted from in-person interactions to primarily virtual interactions and began 2021 with few sales reps in the field in the U.S. We feel good about our capabilities to work with providers virtually and are encouraged as we exited Q1 2021 with the majority of U.S. reps back in the field. As we navigate the early stages of the recovery, we're focused on operational excellence in both virtual and in-person environment and are pleased with the volume and share growth in key brands despite continued pandemic-related headwinds for several classes.  As we look at gross margin, gross margin as a percent of revenue declined 490 basis points to 75.4%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margin as a percent of revenue was 78%, a decrease of 260 basis points, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix driven largely by sales of COVID-19 antibodies and, to a lesser extent, by lower realized prices and revenue.  Moving down the P&L. Operating expenses grew 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2% while R&D expenses increased 21%, driven primarily by $220 million of investments in COVID-19 therapies. Net of the COVID-19 expenses, R&D increased 5%, driven by continued investments in our late-stage pipeline.  Total operating expense growth was less than 3% compared to Q1 2020 when excluding the investments in COVID-19 therapies. Operating income increased 6% compared to Q1 of 2020 and operating income as a percent of revenue was 27.5% for the quarter, a decline of 250 basis points compared to prior year. This decline was driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold.  Other income and expense was income of $35 million this quarter compared to expense of $73 million in Q1 of 2020, driven primarily by a benefit related to favorable European patent settlement for Alimta. As we noted previously, beginning in 2021, we are excluding the gains or losses due to equity investments from our non-GAAP measures and have provided revised figures for 2020 in our investor workbook to enable year-over-year comparison on that same basis.  Our effective tax rate was 10.8%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared with the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for both periods was reduced by net discrete tax benefits with the larger net discrete benefit reflected in the first quarter of 2021. At the bottom line, net income and earnings per share increased 16%.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth across the world. U.S. revenue grew 18% compared to the first quarter of 2020 while revenue decreased slightly, excluding COVID-19 antibodies. Adjusting for the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, the core business grew 5% in the U.S. These results were driven entirely by volume, led by Trulicity and Taltz, partially offset by a mid-single-digit price decline.  Pricing was a 6% drag on U.S. revenue growth this quarter, driven primarily by Taltz' improved access and corresponding higher contracted rates, partially offset by a modest list price increase. Excluding the impact of Taltz' win at ESI, we experienced low single-digit net price decline in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. We noted on previous calls that we expect that Taltz would experience price headwind in Q1 beyond general rate pressure with the improved access position.  There were two pieces of the ESI impact. The first existing patients already covered through medical exceptions were moved to the newly contracted rate, a onetime step-down in prices as we move through 2021. In addition, we were pleased with the update for new patients at ESI at the contracted rate and we expect that, that population will grow meaningfully over time.  There is always a near-term impact when we have a step -- a significant step-up in access. And this win nearly doubled our commercial access. We're encouraged by the volume growth we saw in the first quarter and believe Taltz will return to net sales growth in the second quarter, which should continue to accelerate as we move through the year as the volume growth from the major access upgrade outpaces the related pricing headwind.  Beyond Taltz, segment mix was not a major of U.S. price performance in the first quarter as increased utilization in the more highly rebated government segment was offset by lower utilization in the 340B segment, primarily for our diabetes portfolio. While mid-term trends are stable at present, given the increase in variability in payer mix, we continue to expect quarterly variability in reported net price changes. We also expect Taltz' price impact to moderate as we move through the year and overall, low to mid-single-digit total net price decline in the U.S. for the full year.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 15% in constant currency. Excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the impact of Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking, revenue grew 5% in constant currency despite lockdowns in a number of European countries and driven primarily -- entirely by volume growth for Alimta, Trulicity and Taltz. We're pleased with the momentum of our business in Europe and are looking forward to continued strong growth in 2021.  In Japan, revenue decreased 8% in constant currency, driven entirely by decreased volume for Cialis and Forteo. Net of the impact for those post-patent expiry products, Japan grew 5% in constant currency, driven by Verzenio, Jardiance in collaboration with BI and Olumiant.  In China, revenue grew 26% in constant currency, driven by 32% volume growth, primarily from Tyvyt and, to a lesser extent, our diabetes portfolio. We're excited about the momentum in China as our business has accelerated significantly the past 2 quarters. Tyvyt continues its strong growth, Trulicity and Olumiant are now in the NRDL and we look forward to launch uptake for Verzenio. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued erosion of Cialis.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive impressive volume growth. Despite the Q1 2020 COVID-related stocking benefit impacting year-over-year growth, these newer medicines delivered over 9 percentage point of growth this quarter with COVID antibodies also contributing roughly 14 percentage points of growth. The strong volume growth was partially offset by post-LOE products as well as insulin, whose volume growth was also meaningfully impacted by the Q1 2020 stocking benefit.  Slide 10 highlights the contribution of our key growth products. In total, these brands generated approximately $3.1 billion in revenue this quarter and made up 52% of core business revenue. We are particularly encouraged by Trulicity's performance. 3 years ago, Trulicity was the #2 injectable GLP-1 in the U.S. market at roughly 40% share of market. Weekly scripts for the class were approximately 180,000 and a new weekly injectable entrant had just launched. Since that time, Trulicity has become the most prescribed GLP-1 in the U.S. with a 48% share of the injectable market in a class that is now twice the size at roughly 360,000 weekly scripts.  Trulicity continues to have the highest adherence of any diabetes medication, oral or injectable, with the additional dose of 3 and 4.5 milligram providing the potential for Trulicity to both extend the time on therapy for existing patients and compete for new patients as demonstrated by the new-to-brand share of market having increased more than 4 points since the launch of these additional doses in September 2020. As we start 2021, we are pleased with Trulicity's ability to outgrow the injectable class and establish all-time highs in new therapy starts as well as total market share.  We see meaningful opportunity for continued robust class growth for GLP-1s as they are still less than 1 in 10 diabetes scripts and have significant opportunity for further penetration in the first injectable space as well. With more positive readouts from the tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes this quarter, we remain focused on sustaining Trulicity's leadership position, accelerating class growth and providing continued innovation in the incretin space.  On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1, we invested nearly $3 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of business development, capital expenditure and after-tax investments in R&D. In addition, we returned nearly $800 million to shareholders via dividend. We are focused on utilizing our cash flow -- our strong cash flow to develop the next wave of new medicine through both internal and external sources, as highlighted by the recently completed in-licensing of the RIP kinase 1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals. We will remain active in assessing the in-licensing opportunities as well as bolt-on acquisitions, where we believe we can create shareholders' value and enhance our future growth prospects.  Turning to our 2021 financial guidance on Slide 12. We are updating our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance. We continue to support health care professionals, navigating the ongoing pandemic and driving broad vaccinations to enable return to normalcy for health care systems in the second half of the year. Despite some therapeutic class still at or below pre-COVID baselines for new therapy starts and the highlighted inventory impact on year-over-year growth, we are confident in the performance of our core business.  We are increasing our full year revenue outlook by $100 million to reflect the FX benefit realized on the top line in the first quarter. We are, however, narrowing the range for COVID-19 antibody revenue from approximately $1 billion to $2 billion to $1 billion to $1.5 billion for the year. Based on the rollout of the vaccine across major markets, current antibody utilization rate, existing U.S. government bamlanivimab supply and the transition to only supply bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in the U.S., we believe this update range contemplates a variety of potential scenarios. We recognize that situations across the globe can evolve quickly, and we'll plan to adapt as required moving forward. The net impact of these changes is an updated revenue range of $26.6 billion to $27.6 billion. Our outlook for gross margin percent remains unchanged with the impact of COVID-19 antibodies diluting our total gross margin percent by approximately 100 basis points.  For research and development, we're increasing our range from $6.5 billion to $7.7 billion to $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion. This reflects an increase of $100 million in COVID-19 antibody expense to support the advancement of a third antibody, LY-1404, as we continue to address the COVID-19 pandemic and approximately $300 million on the core business, driven by investments in donanemab for the expansion of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-2 study and the initiation of the new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER Alzheimer's 3 in asymptomatic Alzheimer's patients. Our investments in donanemab is consistent with our R&D strategy to continue to bolster our pipeline to ensure long-term growth, and based on the strength of the data, invest meaningfully in innovative molecules that we believe have the potential to deliver practice change in data that could significantly improve patient outcomes in areas of high unmet need.  We're increasing our non-GAAP range for OID to an expense of $100 million to $200 million to reflect the Alimta patent settlement in Europe I noted earlier, while our GAAP range is now income of $150 million to $250 million, which reflects the impact of equity investment gains in the first quarter. We are lowering our effective tax rate to approximately 13% to reflect higher discrete tax items in the first quarter and a lower base rate. We're lowering our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to approximately 31%. The decrease in operating margin is driven entirely by the decreased investments in Alzheimer's for donanemab. Our longer-term margin expansion remains unchanged as we expect continued operating margin expansion to mid- to high 30s. Our GAAP operating margin is expected to be approximately 26%.  Finally, the non-GAAP range for earnings per share is now $7.80 to $8. The increase on the lower end of the range reflects the net benefit for the core business related to the changes to OID and tax rate as well as increased revenue, offset by increased R&D for investments in donanemab. The reduction in the upper end of the range reflects the narrow revenue range and increased R&D expense for COVID-19 therapies. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $7.03 to $7.23, which reflects an increase to acquire the IP R&D related to completed business development transactions, other specified items related primarily to asset impairments, COVID-19 inventory charges and acquisition and integration costs as well as the benefit from net gains on investments in equity securities. We're confident in our ability to achieve our 2021 revenue goals for the core business while also delivering operating margin expansion in mid-teens EPS growth.  As we move forward, I would encourage you to look at trends in our core business for the first half of the year, given the significant variability we saw across the period in 2020. As a reminder, revenue performance in the second quarter of 2020 was impacted by the reversal of largely all the $250 million COVID-related stocking benefit from Q1 of 2020 as well as an additional $250 million due to the significant decline in new patient prescription as health care utilization decreased and systems temporarily closed down in the face of a surging pandemic. As we look at underlying volume and share trends across our key products, we are confident in our full year outlook for the core business. And the pipeline successes in the first quarter only furthers our conviction in our mid-term and long-term outlook for continued revenue growth and operating margin expansion.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Sure. Thanks, Kerry. Let me start with the budget. So we did increase our guidance for the COVID antibody investment from $300 million to $400 million to $400 million to $500 million. And the investments that we've announced this morning is really to address the growth in variants that we see globally and looking at additional antibodies that could address that. The lowering on the high end of the range, really it relates to the changes you've seen here in the U.S. government as well as what we see globally in terms of progression of the disease, but -- and this is one I know that is more challenging to forecast, given that there's not a lot of TRx data or data for you to look at, and we'll continue to update obviously with every quarter."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Chris, for the question on Verzenio. And so we will be delivering this data set to the FDA without delaying our standard review timing. We can't really comment on what the FDA will do with the data or the application, but these discussions are progressing as planned. Important to note, as the data matures, I think, as Dan said, given the strength of the DRFS hazard ratio, remember, it was a 0.687 haz ratio with a very strong p-value, we are highly confident that the OS will trend in favor of Verzenio. So really, what we believe we're discussing is when that will occur.  So obviously, as I said, we can't comment on the discussion with FDA, but we do look forward to working with them on bringing this medicine to patients. And maybe just a comment to reference how immature this data is. At the time of the interim analysis that we published in JCO late last year, there were 39 deaths in the abema arm and 37 in the control arm. So that makes it really challenging to interpret this data when there's over 5,000 patients in the study. Thanks for the question. Well, thanks, Tim, for the question on Verzenio. So I think, as you're mentioning, it's an incredibly competitive market with the CDK4/6s. And so we and others continue to do what we need to do to make sure that patients get access to the right medicines. So we have obviously a strong strategy there. I can't comment on the specifics, but we do see competition. And really, what we're seeing -- I think you're seeing in Verzenio, what we're seeing is an incredibly nice trend growing in Q1.  As you saw, we had positive momentum with the U.S. strong share growth in March and we saw TRx of over 17% and NBRx of over 28%, so -- and this is despite, as you've noticed, a modest year-on-year TRx market decline. So I think what we're seeing is both from a payer strategy but also very much from a data strategy, we're seeing that Verzenio is growing its share nicely. And so I like how all of our different programs are coming together.  And obviously, the data in AZURE breast cancer reinforce the growing awareness that these medicines are different. But what really has been the focus for our execution has been capitalizing on positive OS data and making sure that people are aware of that and we're seeing more trial, more adoption as we go through that. So very pleased how all of our strategies with Verzenio are coming together.  On Tyvyt, yes, I mean, as you mentioned, it's a competitive space, obviously. And while I can't really comment on our commercial strategy prior to approval, you can be reassured that we're looking at ways to differentiate and really add value to this innovative class of medicines. So obviously, we know that there's certain commercial approaches we'll have to take to capture share as really a late entrant in the field, but we see opportunity here.  And obviously, this deal made sense with the partnership that we've had with Innovent and we're committed to the U.S. submission this year. And so more to come as we look to launch the product and share that strategy and how we intend to make an opportunity here. But as you said, I wouldn't assess this as a large opportunity for Lilly, but an opportunistic one that we think makes sense, it makes sense for patients globally and driving value for them. Thanks for the question. So on monarchE and NCCN, I really can't comment for them. So obviously, we feel that this data is incredibly impactful. I think one of our thought leaders call it the most notable development in HER2-positive breast cancer in the last 2 decades, but we'll just have to wait and see what NCCN decides to do.  And then on Retevmo, the launch is going well. So we had a virtual launch in May, we finished 2020 with $37 million in sales, and we see positive momentum in Q1. So we've had a great engagement with customers. Unaided brand awareness is strong. So we're quite pleased. And this is an incredibly important medicine, as you know, in some patients, over an 80% response rate, so great response from the customers. I'm very enthusiastic about what we're seeing so far."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. 2021 is clearly off to a very positive start for R&D at Lilly with strong pipeline progress already and more potential catalysts on the way. Before I get into the broader portfolio update, I'll spend a few minutes highlighting results from tirzepatide's first 4 top line readouts from the Phase III SURPASS program, including the strong results from SURPASS-2, the head-to-head trial with semaglutide 1 milligram. This program is aptly named as we've seen tirzepatide surpass our expectations through these initial readouts, displaying significantly greater hemoglobin A1C reduction, weight loss and percent of patients reaching normal glucose levels than any GLP-1 on the market.  On Slide 13, you can see impressive performance in the efficacy estimate analysis in glycemic control for tirzepatide with each dose demonstrating superiority in each trial across a range of patient populations, comparators and background medications. The clear highlight is the impressive A1C reduction of the 5-milligram dose across each of these 3 -- each of these different patient populations while the higher doses provide additional glucose control up to and surpassing 2.5% A1C reductions.  Moving to Slide 14. You can see how tirzepatide performed across all 3 doses in terms of patients achieving HbA1c below 5.7%, the normal glycemic level seen in people without type 2 diabetes. We believe this is an exciting finding that may reset expectations for the impact diabetes medications could have for patients. Using the efficacy estimate analysis across SURPASS-1, 2 and 3, we see about half of the patients on the 15-milligram dose of tirzepatide achieve this remarkable level of Hba1c control.  In SURPASS-5, which focused on patients on background insulin glargine, 62% of patients on 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved this level of A1C compared to only 3% of patients in the placebo group. Remember, this is a patient population on background basal insulin with an average duration of diabetes of over 13 years. Achieving this level of glucose control in such a population is something that prior to GIP/GLP-1 agonists like tirzepatide, we did not even contemplate as possible.  On Slide 15, we show the efficacy estimate analysis for weight reduction across the 4 studies. Here again, we see levels of efficacy that previously were thought unobtainable with incretin therapy in type 2 diabetes patients. As we and others have discussed, studies like AWARD-11 and SUSTAIN FORTE have begun to show the limit of what fully hitting the GLP-1 mechanism can accomplish for weight loss and A1C. There appear to be diminishing returns as doses of GLP-1 alone fully saturate the GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism and a flattening of the dose response curve occurs.  And then you look at this slide, including importantly, SURPASS-2. And you can see quite clearly that there's something different going on here as the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist is beyond the flattening of the dose response curve of GLP-1 performance, which we believe evidences the power of adding in the GIP mechanisms. Highlights from these studies include the 15-milligram dose delivering 14% weight reduction in SURPASS-3, noting here weight gain of 3% on insulin degludec comparator, the 15-milligram dose nearly doubling the weight reduction of semaglutide 1-milligram in SURPASS-2 and strong performance from the 5 and 10-milligram doses with statistically superior weight loss, even as high as 11% on the 10-milligram dose versus placebo or active comparators.  We're encouraged that in these 40 and 52-week studies, we haven't yet seen the weight loss curves plateau on the higher doses. It's really exciting to think about how tirzepatide could potentially perform with the longer duration of treatment that we'll see in future studies. We had a lot of confidence in the efficacy data coming out of Phase II. But there was a lot we didn't yet know about safety and tolerability. Recall, for example, that the primary Phase II trial had only about 200 patients on therapy and patients were only on therapy for 26 weeks.  As we look at Slide 16, we've been pleased to see through these 4 SURPASS readouts that the overall safety profile was similar to the well-established GLP-1 receptor agonist class and the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related and mild to moderate in severity. We're particularly encouraged by the potential impact of the optimized dose escalation scheme, and accordingly, by the tolerability profile observed in the Phase III program, which improved greatly in comparison to Phase II, including the lower rates of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting that we've seen, consistent with what we saw in Phase III studies for other well-tolerated and highly used incretin therapies, including our own Trulicity. In addition, we're pleased with the discontinuation rates due to adverse events, which have ranged from 3% to 11% across doses in these studies.  Stepping back from the data a bit, we're excited about the safety and efficacy results across all doses, but perhaps especially so for the efficacy of the 5-milligram dose, which has performed well in each study, including showing superiority to semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2 on both A1C reduction and weight loss. I think these data show that the 5-milligram dose could be a great first incretin that can potentially deliver best-in-class efficacy with tolerability that is as good or better than other leading incretins. So we have the low maintenance dose of 5 milligrams that, if approved, could potentially be appropriate for many patients with physicians knowing they could have higher doses available as they continue management of disease.  Tirzepatide could provide patients with the opportunity to set treatment goals that might surpass what was previously thought possible in type 2 diabetes, both in terms of getting patients to normal glucose control, which has never been contemplated as a potential treatment goal, as well as for impressive weight loss with the highest dose of tirzepatide having roughly double the weight loss of semaglutide 1 milligram in SURPASS-2. Today, type 2 diabetes is largely a treat-to-fail disease.  With these results, tirzepatide, if approved, could potentially provide doctors options to enable early control of glucose and weight. This has the potential to translate to improved levels of end organ protection and a more meaningful reduction in disease complications that has yet been seen. We'll be testing this potential for tirzepatide in ongoing and planned studies in diabetes, obesity, heart failure and NASH. Accordingly, we've now initiated SURMOUNTs-2, 3 and 4 for tirzepatide in obesity and top line results from SURMOUNT-1 are expected next year.  Moving back to diabetes. The top line readout for SURPASS-4, which is in a high cardiovascular risk population and we believe will provide an important contribution to our CV safety assessment, is the gating trial for global submissions in type 2 diabetes. Completion of this trial has always been contingent on accruing a prespecified number of CV events. We've achieved the necessary events, which triggers bringing patients in for final treatment and safety visits before moving the trial to completion. Based on this update, we anticipate a top line readout by the middle of this year. We look forward to disclosing the results of SURPASS-1, 2, 3 and 5 at the ADA 2021 Virtual Meeting, which will include a 90-minute ADA symposium featuring these results the morning of June 29.  While we're excited with the progress of tirzepatide, we think innovation in the incretin space is not over. At ADA, we'll also be discussing preclinical and Phase I data for our glucagon/GLP/GIP triagonist, also known as GGG, which we're pleased to announce we'll be moving into Phase II later this quarter. We've previously commented that in this space, we have a high bar for progressing molecules in development, one that has been raised recently by tirzepatide. While it's still early, we're advancing GGG to Phase II based on our belief that it could exceed the benefits seen with tirzepatide. With our GGG molecule, we expect to see even more weight loss than what can be achieved with tirzepatide while preserving glucose-lowering efficacy. In addition, due to glucagon's direct action on the liver, we'd also hope to see benefits in NASH. Consequently, our ambitious Phase II program is designed to evaluate GGG for obesity, type 2 diabetes and NASH.  In addition to our next-generation incretins, we're also very excited by our novel weekly insulin, basal insulin-Fc. Thanks to Lilly's work on Trulicity, weekly incretin therapy is now the standard of care in the GLP-1 space. And together with tirzepatide, we hope incretin-based therapies will become the standard of care in the first injectable space for people with type 2 diabetes. For those people who need basal insulin therapy in addition to their incretin therapy, we'd like to make weekly insulin therapy possible, ultimately avoiding daily injections completely. We'll give an update at ADA on our novel weekly basal insulin. We plan to have an investor call in the morning of July 1 to discuss the data releases at ADA for tirzepatide, GGG and weekly basal insulin.  While the progress in our diabetes portfolio is compelling, Lilly has continued to advance the rest of our pipeline this quarter. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 23 and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. In addition to the progress on tirzepatide I just discussed, major developments since our last earnings call include progress with donanemab on multiple fronts. In terms of data, we presented detailed results at AD/PD showing donanemab met its primary endpoint, significantly slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo on the integrated Alzheimer's disease rating scale, a composite measure of cognition and daily function in patients with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. And data from secondary analyses showed donanemab consistently slowed cognitive and functional decline with ranges between 20% and 40% in all secondary endpoints with nominal statistical significance at multiple time points compared to placebo.  On the clinical front, as we discussed in detail on our call last month, we expanded TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 to be a Phase III study, and it's now enrolling quickly. And today, we're announcing that we will start a new Phase III study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3, in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. This trial is anticipated to begin enrollment later this year. Our goal here is to enroll patients who already have Alzheimer's brain pathology but don't yet have any clinical symptoms. The study will have development and progression of Alzheimer's disease symptoms as the primary endpoint. And we anticipate it will take approximately 3 years from completion of enrollment to reach a sufficient number of events. We'll be testing if a short course of donanemab treatment at the start of the trial can prevent progression in a substantial fraction of patients over the subsequent several years. These types of trials are extremely challenging to enroll and conduct. But here, we're buoyed by our expertise in biomarkers, including both PET scans and importantly, our plasma P-tau217 assay.  On the regulatory front, based on feedback from the FDA, we currently do not see a path forward for near-term submission and approval based on the first TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study alone. As you know, the unmet need in Alzheimer's disease is significant. So while we remain focused on speeding up enrollment and completion of our second pivotal study, TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, we are continuing to actively engage with the FDA and are fully exploring any opportunities for early submission.  Another highlight this quarter was the initiation of pirtobrutinib's Phase III program with study start in chronic lymphocytic leukemia as monotherapy. We're also proud of the continuation of our work against COVID-19, including a planned transition from bamlanivimab alone to the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together for the treatment of COVID-19 in the U.S., accomplished by first gaining Emergency Use Authorization for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in February and then our request for revocation of the EUA for bamlanivimab alone, which FDA subsequently granted.  We also submitted bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for regulatory review in Europe. And we initiated the evaluation of bamlanivimab with VIR-7831 in collaboration with Vir and GSK as well as started trials with a new, potentially broadly neutralizing antibody, LY-1404, in collaboration with AbCellera in case new combinations are needed to fight variants. We announced top line Phase III results evaluating baricitinib on top of standard of care, which did not meet statistical significance on the primary endpoint for treatment of COVID-19 but did result in a significant reduction of death from any cause by 38% by day 28. And baricitinib received regulatory approval in conjunction with remdesivir as a treatment for COVID-19 in Japan.  Our work on tirzepatide, donanemab and pirtobrutinib brings great potential for patients in the long term and is highly prioritized at Lilly. Our work on COVID-19 is another clear highlight, where we moved quickly to help address an unmet medical need in the midst of a pandemic. We're optimistic though that this need will wane in the coming years. Beyond these significant efforts, there's been progress across many other commercial stage and clinical stage assets.  Starting in oncology, we're pleased with the approval of selpercatinib for non-small cell lung cancer and thyroid cancer in Europe. We're also pleased that the results of monarchE, our adjuvant breast cancer study, are now submitted in Japan, along with Europe, China and the U.S. As you know, the primary endpoint for the study was invasive disease-free survival, which we hit at the interim analysis. As anticipated, this hazard ratio continues to strengthen over time as more events have accrued. Important secondary endpoints for the study include distant relapse-free survival and overall survival.  For the U.S. submission, the FDA has noted, and we agree, that the OS data are immature and thus unreliable as we shared in the JCO publication last year. FDA has, therefore, asked us to see an updated OS analysis during the review cycle to determine that OS is trending in favor of Verzenio. Given the robust distant relapse-free survival data, we're highly confident that the overall survival data will eventually reflect and reinforce the survival benefit. But it takes time for these events to accrue, especially in the adjuvant setting.  In immunology, we have positive Phase III readouts for baricitinib in alopecia areata, a disease with significant unmet medical need, and we look forward to regulatory submissions starting in the second half of this year. We also announced that the FDA extended the review period for baricitinib for atopic dermatitis by 3 months, another disease where we think JAK inhibition could potentially alleviate important unmet medical needs.  With mirikizumab, we reported positive Phase III results in ulcerative colitis in the 12-week induction study, hitting the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, and we look forward to seeing the maintenance data early next year. We also have updates to mirikizumab psoriasis program. While the OASIS program generated positive results with safety and efficacy similar to other IL-23p19s, we believe the psoriasis market is well served with highly effective treatment options, including Taltz.  Lilly's immunology strategy is to focus our new molecules and indications on areas where patients have significant unmet needs, not merely adding new options or leveraging commercial presence to create a space, where effective solutions like Taltz already exist for patients. Therefore, we will not pursue submission of mirikizumab in psoriasis, but instead, we'll focus our efforts on the ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease indications, where unmet medical need is higher and where we believe the potential of the IL-23p19 mechanism to create a new standard of care is greater.  In addition to late-stage progress, our early-stage portfolio continues to advance with the introduction of 5 new Phase I assets and the attrition of 2. In addition to the progress we've made in just the first few months of the year, we anticipate important developments for the remainder of 2021, including the final readout for tirzepatide's Phase III type 2 diabetes program, SURPASS-4, noted earlier; Phase III results for Jardiance in HFpEF and for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis; regulatory actions for Jardiance for HFrEF, Verzenio in the adjuvant setting for ER-positive breast cancer, baricitinib for atopic dermatitis and tanezumab for osteoarthritis pain, where we previously noted our disappointment in the outcome of the Tanezumab Advisory Committee; the presentation of Phase I data for our oral SERD; the initiation of Phase I for a BCL-2 inhibitor and for KRAS G12C inhibitor; along with the filing of an IND for our next-generation RET inhibitor later this year as we announced at AACR; and the Phase II readout for zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody for early Alzheimer's disease.  We believe our continued pipeline success drives increasing visibility to meaningful long-term growth, and we look forward to continued progress across our portfolio in the coming quarters.  Now I turn the call back over to Dave for some closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question on zagotenemab, our anti-tau antibody. Before I come to combinations, maybe I'd just handicap this Phase II trial quickly. The pro here in favor of tau is clearly genetic validation and pathologic validation of the target. It's a great target for Alzheimer's disease. The cons here that we have to acknowledge is data from other companies' tau antibodies, which hasn't been particularly promising, and the difficulty in hitting the tau target in the brain. Now we have a differentiated antibody here that binds just aggregated tau, so perhaps there's reason to think we could get different results.  We're certainly eagerly awaiting those data in the second half of the year. And you're exactly right, if we see efficacy, combination would be an important consideration here. For sure, the general theme of combining an anti-amyloid drug with an anti-tau drug is a good one, particularly when you have a drug like donanemab, where you can completely clear amyloid plaques with a limited duration of therapy and then perhaps at that moment, intervene with an anti-tau drug. I do think that's the future. It's something we're actively considering, pending, of course, data on the tau antibody. Yes. Thanks, Vamil, for the question on TRAILBLAZER-3 and our enrollment goals here. We probably don't get into too many details here, but we are, of course, expecting to -- this to be a large trial involving thousands of individuals, but yet we also set very ambitious enrollment goals. And while we don't have all the details planned out on how to achieve this, our goal is that we should be able to enroll this trial in about a year. That's pretty exciting to contemplate.  And Alzheimer's prevention trial is something that makes great sense, given the science and the biology here and what we know about the onset of Alzheimer's disease and its relation to years of having amyloid plaque in the brain. But there have been 2 major drawbacks that have not made these trials really very practical. First is finding the patients. That has gone from impossible before our introduction of amyloid PET scan to possible but really hard with amyloid PET scans as we experienced firsthand in the A4 trial to now something that's eminently feasible with our advent of the plasma tau -- phospho-tau217 assay. That's a huge advance that just unlocks this trial.  The second is if you think about this population, which is not experiencing symptoms, is a bit younger than an Alzheimer's population and introducing a therapy that is likely an infusion that they take for the rest of their lives, that's also a pretty significant hurdle. Again, we've, I think, abrogated that risk with donanemab in a limited treatment duration to give lasting plaque clearance, so excited about the TRAILBLAZER-3 trial. I'll just take it quickly. No, Andrew, it's -- the focus here is on the overall survival. On the distant relapse-free survival, as we commented, the curves are not coming together, they're actually separating more. It's improving as we get more events. So I'm not aware of any concerns around that. Yes, sure. So FDA feedback is -- has been continuing, I should say. We had some and it continues to come. I think our view here is unchanged. We previously said that the FDA has concerns around iADRS because it combines cognition and function. And there's always a risk that you could have a positive signal on iADRS driven by cognition with no benefit on function or function going the other way or vice versa. And that wouldn't be acceptable for approval of a new drug. So that's the risk there. On the CD73 Phase I termination, I don't have additional comments. Sure. Gregg, thanks for the question. Pain is still a really important unmet medical need. Clearly, the regulatory bar is high here in terms of safety. And we saw that from the Tanezumab Advisory Committee meeting, which was a pretty decisive outcome there and one that we were disappointed in."

            "name": "Michael Mason",
            "content": "Chris, thanks for your question. No, the tirzepatide results have not changed the way we want to position tirzepatide in the marketplace. Obviously very pleased with those results. We're also just really blessed to have both Trulicity and tirzepatide. Our goal will be to maximize our entire incretin portfolio. Trulicity has established a strong market position. And I think the best data to support that is just how we've been able to grow share of market in the face of Ozempic and Rybelsus. So it has a strong position in the marketplace and that will remain.  But now as we think about tirzepatide, the dual incretin mechanism, that GIP component is really a game changer. Dan went through the results, but we just haven't seen the ability to return to someone living with type 2 diabetes, whether they're late or early, someone with type 2 diabetes progression, back to normal A1C. In fact, we were able to get 50% to 60% people back, it's really incredible. Also weight loss at the highest dose, up to 14%. So when you just take a look at that and you take a look at the fact that 90% of people who live with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese, they can really benefit from early treatment with type 2 diabetes.  So the real question is why would you want to put them on something else early on? And why would you want to wait for them to have those benefits? So we see tirzepatide has the potential to really transform the market, driving earlier use of incretin, in particular tirzepatide's dual mechanism, and really expand the incretin market. So I think tirzepatide will clearly win some new patients that would have went on to Trulicity. You have some people who were maybe not performing well or not -- or needed more efficacy that will go on to tirzepatide. But clearly, our focus will be to profoundly change and disrupt the type 2 diabetes marketplace by driving earlier use of incretins with tirzepatide. Yes. Thanks for the question on the SUMMIT trial. We're bullish on the opportunity for tirzepatide in HFpEF. When you look at that, it's really a large unmet need with nearly 4 million people living with HFpEF heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization in the U.S. When you look at it scientifically, you do see that there is a BC-related HFpEF phenotype that we believe that tirzepatide can play a large role in helping out. And so that's what really drove our investment in SUMMIT. And I think the team has done a nice job of coming up with a creative approach that will provide, I think, robust data for payers and clinicians to make that decision. So I think we're very confident in this -- in both our clinical trial design as well as the commercial opportunity. Yes. Thanks for the question. No, we have no concerns. We will -- we have reached the number we needed to complete the trial. We're getting patients back in. We'll have that data, should start to see top line in May, and we'll release that information in -- before the end of the quarter. We're very, very excited about tirzepatide and very confident in its CV profile. I'm looking forward to seeing the SURPASS-4 data."

            "name": "David Ricks",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Lilly entered 2021 focused on expanding our reach to over 45 million patients by scaling our key growth brands around the world, continuing the advancement of our pipeline following a very successful 2020 and increasing productivity in the SG&A line while investing in research for sustainable long-term growth. We are pleased with the progress we've made on these objectives in our first quarter while also delivering hundreds of thousands of doses of our COVID-19 antibodies to patients to help the continued fight against COVID-19. As we unpack this quarter's results, we will attempt to give you a clear picture of the underlying trends in our core business.  We recognize this quarter was noisy, catching the increased consumer stock in from the Q1 2020 in our quarterly compare and increased COVID-19 therapy R&D spend in 2021. These items, coupled with the FX rate movement and a number of changes to U.S. government purchase agreements for COVID-19 antibodies throughout the quarter, make for a longer earnings call and press release. And we realize, for those keeping score on sell-side model accuracy, perhaps some disappointment. Nonetheless, underneath all of that is a strong and growing core business for Lilly and a significant number of positive, even compelling pipeline readouts in the quarter to support long-term growth across all of our core therapy areas. And we continue to expect top line growth and margin expansion to accelerate throughout this year.  This quarter, revenue grew 16% compared to Q1 2020 or 13% in constant currency. This performance was driven entirely by volume, which grew 17 percentage points. As previously highlighted in Q1 2020, we had roughly a $250 million COVID-19-related inventory build that is impacting the year-over-year comparison. When excluding COVID-19 antibody revenue and the Q1 2020 stocking benefit, our core business grew 7% for the quarter. Key growth products continued to drive volume and revenue growth and now represent 52% of our core business in Q1 2021.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 75.4% in Q1 and 78% excluding the impact of foreign exchange on international inventories sold. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 27.5% for the quarter and 30.1% excluding the FX impact. While foreign exchange on international inventories sold has a modest effect on our Q1 -- on our results in 2019 and 2020, in the first quarter of 2021, we experienced over 250 basis point of negative impact on our gross margin and operating margin. Recall that is purely a noncash accounting item.  On the pipeline front, we achieved multiple milestones since our Q4 earnings call, including the Phase III initiation of pirtobrutinib, formerly known as LOXO-305; and for additional obesity studies in tirzepatide's SURMOUNT program; the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization for the administration of bamlanivimab and etesevimab together as a treatment for COVID-19; positive Phase III results from tirzepatide's SURPASS-2, 3 and 5 trials in type 2 diabetes; and positive Phase III results for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis and baricitinib in alopecia areata.  About a decade ago, Lilly made the decision to enter into and invest in immunology with the Phase III initiation of ixekizumab, now known as Taltz. Since then, we have added Olumiant in rheumatoid arthritis and several new indications with first or best-in-category data for Taltz and Olumiant in rheumatology and dermatology. This year, we see further expansion of our immunology strategy with the successful completion of Phase III studies of mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis. The first IL-23p19 antibody medicine to demonstrate results in this setting.  We're also excited about lebrikizumab's potential to differentiate from Dupixent on itch, sleep and safety, primarily in conjunctivitis, in what is an increasingly large and growing class with meaningful unmet medical need. And we anticipate multiple Phase III readouts for lebrikizumab later this year in monotherapy and in combination with corticosteroids. We look forward to potentially reaching increasing numbers of patients in difficult-to-treat immunology conditions in the coming years.  We also entered into several business development deals, including the in-licensing of a RIPK1 inhibitor from Rigel Pharmaceuticals and the divestiture of QBREXZA, which along with lebrikizumab was part of the Dermira acquisition last year. We also distributed nearly $800 million in dividends this quarter with the share -- dividend per share increasing 15% versus last year.  Moving on to Slides 5 and 6, you'll see a list of key events since our last earnings call. We announced plans to host a webinar to provide an overview of the company's commitment in the areas of environmental, social and governance for the investment community, for media and the general public on May 4, 2021. Additionally, we announced 2 planned retirements of long-tenured executives and several additions to our leadership team. I'd like to thank Myles O'Neill, President of Lilly Manufacturing; and Melissa Barnes, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, for their leadership and service to our company. We also extend a warm welcome to Edgardo Hernandez, who will be succeeding Myles; to Alonzo Weems, who will succeed Melissa; and to Diogo Rau, who will be joining Lilly next month as Chief Information and Digital Officer, succeeding Aarti Shah, whose retirement was announced last fall.  Finally, we announced the appointment of Anat Ashkenazi, our CFO. Anat has a deep experience, having been the CFO of every part of our value chain. For the last 4 years, Anat has a large -- has led a large portion of our finance organization with all of our divisional CFOs reporting to her as well as our accounting and financial reporting team, our corporate strategy group and our business transformation office. During this time, Anat worked closely with me, our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors to develop and implement our annual business and long-term strategic plans. I have no doubt that Anat will perform extremely well as CFO of Lilly and expect no changes in our priorities, our strategy or execution, given her significant involvement in all those areas.  Anat, welcome to our leadership team, and I'll turn the call over to you for our Q1 results. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made to start the year. Amid several moving pieces in a challenging health care environment, we are excited by the momentum we are seeing. Our business grew 16% in the first quarter with the core business growing 7%, adjusted for COVID-19 antibody revenue and last year's COVID-19-related inventory stocking benefit. Our top line growth continues to be strong, driven strongly by volume across our key growth products, which account for more than half of our core business.  Net of the significant impact from foreign exchange on international inventories sold, our operating margin was in line with our expectations as we continue to expect operating margin expansion throughout the year and further expansion in years to come. We made significant progress developing new medicines with many more data readouts expected this year. Advances for tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, Verzenio, mirikizumab, Retevmo and Olumiant, serve as a reminder of the breadth and depth of opportunities we have to sustain robust long-term growth. We returned nearly $800 million to shareholders, being increased dividend, reflecting confidence in the ongoing strength of our business.  I want to say thank you to my Lilly teammates, whose commitment to excellence and dedication to our purpose of bringing innovative new medicines to patients is inspiring and drove these accomplishments amidst ongoing pandemic headwinds. While our people, health care providers and patients continue to face near-term challenges associated with COVID-19, our long-term outlook is as bright as ever.  This concludes our prepared remarks. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to moderate the Q&A session. Yes, Seamus. Look, on tax, this is a live discussion, of course, because the president has introduced a number of ideas on corporate tax changes. I guess we join a growing chorus of large companies who oppose, that means to raise revenue, especially when the stated policy goal of the infrastructure plan is to build back the economy. Of course, private money and corporate actions make up the vast majority of the investment that could or would occur. And taxing that seems like a bad idea, maybe the opposite idea from the bill itself.  Within the bill, maybe just a couple of general comments, and we can follow up if we need to. There's the nominal rate discussion, which, of course, when we say moving from 21% to 28% is moving toward the middle of the pack, is not true because, of course, in the U.S., we have state-level income tax. It would really put the U.S. at the highest developed economy in terms of corporate tax rate.  Additionally, we're the only major economy that taxes overseas earnings of its domiciled companies and changing the so-called GILTI tax, foreign minimum tax, really is punitive to our home companies in multiple ways and is something that would have a disproportionate effect on pharmaceutical companies. And so both these actions don't make a lot of sense to us and we oppose. We would favor things like looking at funding the IRS, so they can collect taxes from all the people that don't pay, including businesses and other items that could be pay-fors, we certainly support infrastructure in many ways.  On drug pricing, this has been pushed out a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised if we see HR 3 being debated soon, but as you may have read, apparently it won't be part of the second package from the White House. That's good because HR 3 and those concepts are really set to take a huge piece out of the industry, do nothing for patient out-of-pocket affordability and really derail the innovation machine that is the only reason we're escaping from the COVID-19 pandemic. So we will oppose that with every ounce of our being as pharma.  That said, we are all for changes to the system that make out-of-pocket costs go down for patients. There are a lot of ways to do this within the system that the industry is willing to put pay-fors on the table. This is much more around the contours of maybe what we saw with Senate Finance or the reported proposals made in the 11th hour of the last administration. We will table those ideas. We are tabling those ideas. And I think probably in the second half, you'll hear more about that.  We think there's a great opportunity to improve affordability and strengthen the health care system and really address health care inequities as well that occur because people who are of lower economic means, people of color, women are disproportionately affected by bad insurance design and bad benefit design. We can shore those up and make the health care system work better for everyone. Ilya, just to jump in on top of that, of course, there will be a dosing convenience and dosing certainty benefit with lebri as well. And maybe just to add as a mindset thing, we didn't get into this because we were thinking about margins or business profile, it was to be useful during the pandemic, which is still going on, obviously, raging in other parts of the world. One other driver for the top line is that increasingly, we'll be selling our products into lower-priced markets or giving it away because that's where the disease is. And when the pandemic period ends, I think we can then take a different look at this enduring business, but we're not there yet. So we're making the investments we need to, to be useful and selling the product where it's needed at the price structure we had previously announced, which is heavily discounted in low GDP markets. Okay. Thanks, Kevin. We appreciate your participation in today's call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. 2021 has been -- has begun with good momentum in our underlying business. We remain focused on executing our innovation-based strategy to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. As we continue to scale our diverse commercial portfolio, complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment.  Thanks again for dialing in today. Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we have not addressed on today's call. Hope everyone has a great day."

            "name": "Jacob Van Naarden",
            "content": "Thanks for the question, Louise, about pirtobrutinib, LOXO-305 and LOXO-338, the BCL-2 inhibitor. I think as it relates to differentiation, I'd point out a few things. First off, obviously, as I think you and others know, pirtobrutinib itself is a differentiated BTK inhibitor that we believe affords certain advantages in combination. Obviously, we need to prove that clinically, but that's our hypothesis right now. So that sort of stands on its own. The LOXO-338 program, the BCL-2 inhibitor, we'll be putting into the clinic this year. And obviously, important that, that drug meets its human pharmacology goals so that we know that it itself is on track as a drug. Should that prove to be the case, which we expect it to, we will then look to combine these 2 agents.  I think when you look out at others that are combining BTK and BCL-2, the latter largely being venetoclax, I think what you see is a very fragmented landscape of asset ownership across companies, and as a result of that, some -- oftentimes perverse incentives about how to combine those drugs and where. We think it's important that if you have a new and differentiated BTK inhibitor like we believe we do with pirtobrutinib, we thought it was strategically important to own our own BCL-2 inhibitor. And so we think we'll be really the only player in the field who owns both agents outright. So that, to us, is a key differentiating feature downstream. But it's still a bunch of hoops we have to jump through to enable that combination."

            "name": "Ilya Yuffa",
            "content": "Great. Geoff, thank you for the question. On mirikizumab, really as we see the greatest opportunity for unmet need for patients and we've said all along, we believe that mirikizumab has the greatest opportunity in GI, in IBD, in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We were pleased with the LUCENT-1 results. And so we're looking forward to seeing the maintenance data at the early part of next year.  In terms of psoriasis, as we take a look at the market and unmet need, we do continue to believe that Taltz is the gold standard and best in disease and believe that really is a market well served. And so the decision from a portfolio standpoint is to focus our efforts in places where we believe we can have the greatest unmet need. And GI is where we're focused for mirikizumab. Sure. So on Taltz, first, let me just say we're really pleased about the progress we're making on Taltz and the growth that we're seeing with the step-up in access upgrades, ESI and beyond. And so as we take a look, even though that we've had some price impact in Q1, there are some elements there where we have a number of patients that were on medical exception that are now in the rebated contract that we have with ESI. Of course, we're also seeing an increase in overall volumes with ESI. What's encouraging is that we're not only seeing improvements in overall volume based off of switches, we're also seeing significant improvement in our new therapy starts.  And so we're, in dermatology, now the leading share in dermatology with over 19% share. And then in rheumatology, we're almost doubling our share from previous year. And so as we think about the year in terms of growth, we do believe we'll get to net sales growth in Q2, and we'll continue to accelerate that volume growth throughout the year. The contracting that we have for Taltz is -- goes beyond 1 year. And so we're encouraged about the volume growth of over 20% now, and we continue to see encouraging signs in the market. Yes. Seamus, so thank you for the question. As you noted and what we said on the call is that we're quite excited about our progress in immunology as a whole. And if we think about the growth opportunities within immunology, atopic dermatitis is one catalyst for the company, both in what we believe in Olumiant's success but also lebrikizumab. In terms of the question around JAKs and FDA decision, I won't speculate on any decision the FDA may make. But it's safe to say that the delay across all JAKs in atopic dermatitis and other indications suggests that there's a broader review on JAK safety. We feel that Olumiant has a robust safety profile. And with dermatology being more safety conscious, we do believe that Olumiant has a very good prospect to compete in this space, especially after topical failure.  And then lebrikizumab is one to watch out for, for the second half of the year. As we get more data, well, we feel like we can compete and differentiate versus Dupixent. And so long-term prospect and catalysts for growth are very good for having both mechanisms. And we also see catalyst for growth in alopecia areata, a very -- to be first in disease with Olumiant. And so we feel very good about our chances to not only compete but also to have significant growth and have meaningful outcomes for patients. Yes. Louise, thank you for the question about lebrikizumab. In terms of area differentiation, the focus for lebrikizumab is not only to look at the efficacy on skin but also one of the more impactful symptoms related to atopic dermatitis is itch. And so we believe we may have the opportunity to differentiate an itch, which also has impact on sleep. And we believe that lebrikizumab may have a better safety profile. So that's where we believe we can differentiate. And so we're excited to get the results for lebrikizumab at the back half of the year. In terms of new indications, I think it's early to take a look at any new indications. We're obviously evaluating opportunities to grow lebrikizumab. But our full focus right now is making sure we have success in atopic dermatitis. Sure. Yes, Carter, listen, as you noted, in terms of building franchises across immunology, we've built up our scale in dermatology and excited about increasing number of treatments there, the same with rheumatology in the hope for finding lupus as well. And then in GI, mirikizumab will be our first entrant into GI with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. And then we do have a pretty robust pipeline in both Phase I and proof-of-concept studies, in particular, IL-2 conjugate that we're studying for ulcerative colitis as well. And we look forward to bringing out new treatments across all three of those areas in the coming years. Yes. Ronny, thanks for the question on immunology. In terms of our focus, it's -- let's not -- conscious is more related to looking at opportunities for growth. We have a long runway for Taltz. And so we do believe that Taltz is kind of at the foundation of our immunology strategy. We have numerous head-to-head studies in real world evidence to suggest that Taltz is a best-in-disease treatment. And as part of our growth strategy looking at mirikizumab in GI, we do believe that within the next 5 to 10 years, we can, across multiple mechanisms in those 3 specialized groups, dermatology, rheumatology and GI, have significant growth and become a top-tier immunology company. In terms of pricing, I think it's -- they're all very competitive fields. And so our goal is to have great evidence and create access opportunities for patients that need these treatments."

Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Lois. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q4 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke from the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. And now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Joe. 2022 as a year of strong pipeline and commercial performance for Lilly. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the US and significant FX headwinds and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline. In our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for two assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway, pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets. On January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval. We have consistently stated that, we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time. Also in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor, for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, is novel reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway, following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor. We are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of two of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time. On slide 4 you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter. For pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase 3 readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the US for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina, to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead. On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability and we entered into a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities and technologies. Finally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4 we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Moving to slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13. One item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable high-quality insulin to at least one million people living with diabetes in low to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa. This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost high-quality medicines. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term. With this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro-bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges. We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality healthcare for 30 million people, living in limited resource settings annually by 2030. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks Dave. Slide 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. As Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022. Biptimozumab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any US region and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023. Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 45-basis point dampening of revenue growth in Q4. Key growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. Total operating expenses declined 1% in Q4, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021, driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8% an increase from 26.8% in 2021. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision for requiring capitalization, amortization of research, and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared. In addition this provision did increase our tax payments in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion. At the bottom-line earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter US revenue declined 10%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the US. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro, and Jardiance. Net price was flat in the US this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the US was in line with our expectation. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4, increased 8% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity including, the Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect to return to growth this year, as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro. In China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency, as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog, as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sales of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15% points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume, was substantial in Q4 2022 and was largely offset -- and largely offset volume growth from key products. While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first three quarters of 2023, our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products including Mounjaro. Slide 10, further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue. While Lilly's incretins portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth both in percentage and absolute terms, for other key products including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the edge of an indication. Jardiance sales grew 42% and the product retains the leadership position, in a competitive market globally. Demand for our incretins portfolio remains strong both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the US, and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches. In terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretins products. There have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies and receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the US. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to his website details regarding affected doses and expected timing. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretins business, we have announced plans to add additional, substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts, is our RTP side North Carolina where progress continues as planned and we look forward to the start of production later this year. Moving to Slide 11. Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile, and positive customer experiences. For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts, are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretins class and further 10% of switches from Trulicity. As we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program, by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes, but were not expected to impact net revenue. As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions with some week-by-week volatility driven by end of year seasonality. We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1st AXIS [ph] stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. Regarding the percentage of paid scripts. For Q4 we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40% with paid script defined as those prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay card. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment. In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity in our future innovation through R&D and business development. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range. During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022 and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%. This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding FX rates there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only one month into the year and FX markets can be quite volatile. As I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023 given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022. To a lesser extent the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the US in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business excluding COVID-19 antibodies. This year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top two revenue growth through 2030. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan, to provide an update on our pipeline.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks Anat. 2022 was a really productive year for Lilly R&Ds. We advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022. As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib now known as Jaypirca. By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch two new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for ganitumab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval. In 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer, our weekly insulin for diabetes, remternetug in Alzheimer's disease and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have Orforglipron and Retatrutide in diabetes and obesity. Given the updates we provided in mid-December, today I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30th and slides 15 and 16, show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023. Starting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, in November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to-date. The results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance, in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety data were consistent with previous findings confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA and EMA for approval and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months. In January we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to Insulin Glargine, in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. With this initiation all five studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway. Moving to earlier stage assets in our Diabetes and CV pipeline, in Q4 we advanced two assets into Phase II, that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apoA protein and the lipoprotein particle and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apoA in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D Investor Meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022. We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting ApoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I. Our genetic medicines portfolio is advancing and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules. Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor. In oncology, we're of course pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo at Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program which recently dosed its first patient. Also, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting. As a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received two to five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence. Lastly turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the US FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated Cohort 1 KI-67 greater than 20% population. In immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study. Moving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021. With regards to donanemab. As Dave mentioned, the sole efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was a number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance. Due to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as six months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRABLASER-ALZ-2 study in Q2 of this year. In summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year. Now I turn the call back to Dave.\nDave Ricks: Thanks Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2022. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type two diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management. In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ-2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people. Finally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023. With continued growth in Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year and no strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030 and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world. So now, I'll turn it over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] Lois, please go ahead and provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Colin Bristow from UBS. Please go ahead.\nColin Bristow: Hey good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just first on Mounjaro. So, it looks like the net price dropped to gain in 3Q to 4Q. Can you just walk us through what specifically drove this, and just update us on how you expect this to trend over the course of the year? And then just maybe looking sort of out to the future of your obesity portfolio, beyond 4G [ph], do you have any interest in mechanisms that target the sort of the mitochondrion coupling side of the equation, that would be helpful. Thank you\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Colin. We'll go to Mike for the first question on gross to net and price for Mounjaro and then hand over to Dan for kind of broader obesity mechanistic commentary. Mike?\nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that is to take a look at what we saw as kind of our Mounjaro paid scripts in Q4 and then how we think that will progress over '23. In the fourth quarter, we classify about 40% of Mounjaro scripts as paid, which we defined as patients that aren't supported by our $25 non-coverage savings program. In our savings program, as we discussed at launch was designed to bridge people living with type 2 diabetes to access. As we discussed in the Q3 earnings call, we have adjusted a program to better ensure, it's being used for people living only with type 2 diabetes. These adjustments included removing our $25 non-covered benefit from our savings card for new patients. We didn't make any adjustments for existing patients who are seeing these cards are set to expire on June of this year, June 30. As expected, these changes have reduced new patient start volume, while increasing the percent of new patients with a history of diabetes treatments and the percent with formulary coverage. I think the way I would look at our savings program right now for new patients is that, we have graduated from the bridging program and now are kind of the type of savings program, really focused on covered patients that you would do in kind of a normalized cycle of a product. So thus we expect that Mounjaro's percent of paid scripts and a net revenue per script to increase through 2023, as we continue to increase access and grow new starts. We remain disciplined in our access discussions so we can maximize long-term value. From the start, our value our approach was to make sure that we capture value in the long-term versus the short term and we've remained very disciplined on that. We have just over 50% access for lives in Part D and commercial segments for people living with type 2 diabetes We're very pleased where we're at on the access front and where the way our contracting has turned out at this point. So hopefully that helps provide some color to our gross to net in Q4. Thanks.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Colin for your question on future mechanisms for treating obesity. I can assure you we're not done innovating on behalf of people with obesity. There's a lot we can still do. I think keep your eyes open for more to come from Lilly labs on incretins and related types of mechanisms, but also broadly interested in a variety of new non-incretins-based mechanisms. You specifically asked about one mitochondrial uncoupling but there are several others, I think that also have promise for patients. I just sort of put a note of caution though treating obesity we need to have a very high bar for the types of medicines we develop, remembering that this is a chronic often lifetime disease and highly prevalent population. We need medicines that first and foremost are extremely safe and really highly well tolerated for patients. So that's what we're looking for in future mechanisms.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Colin. Lois, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks very much. One follow-up on the last set of questions. Is it still reasonable to think about a net Mounjaro price that could be above that of Trulicity as we look out to 2024 or whenever you achieve kind of comparable payer access. And then my question was on donanemab. I know there wasn't a huge revenue opportunity tied to the accelerated approval. But I think you had talked about using that gap between accelerated approval and full approval to really ramp physician education and infrastructure, et cetera. How do you kind of manage through that now I guess where we're going to have maybe a full approval that could be occurring closer into a CMS decisions? So just maybe elaborate a bit on what that means for donanemab over time. Thank you.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Chris. All right. We'll go to Mike for the question about Mounjaro price kind of over time and how it might compare to Trulicity. And then to Anne on your donanemab question about activity that would occur to ramp up HCP education. Mike? \nMike Mason: Yes, thanks for the question. I can't get into roles about our net price for obvious reasons but maybe I'll address the question this way. I mean if you look at \u2013 when we have - when we reach \u2013 we think we'll reach broad access for Mounjaro and reach ultimately similar access levels that we have for Trulicity. There's nothing differently about how we'll promote or how to support patients on Mounjaro versus Trulicity. So at the end of the day it will come down to our net price negotiations with payers. We believe that Mounjaro has a better profile. We invest a lot of innovation in there. And we do believe that it should have a better net price than Trulicity.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Mike. Anne? \nAnne White: Yes. Thanks, Chris for the question on physician education and readiness. So as you said, the accelerate approval is not going to provide access for the vast majority of patients. So it doesn't impact us in that way. And obviously, accelerate approval would have made it maybe a little bit easier to do some of the things that we wanted to do, but there's still a great deal that we can do actually have been doing to make sure that the healthcare system is ready for these medicines. So we begin working on that, things such as developing the diagnostic ecosystem are incredibly important, making sure that there's better integrated Alzheimer's disease pathways to make sure that physicians can properly identify refer infuse these patients. So that's the area of focus right now. Certainly diagnostics are a key area of focus for Lilly. We've continued to expand our PET network to make sure that we're ready for patient diagnosis. And then as well we continue to be committed to PTAL blood tests and intend to launch that this year. So many things going on that I think can make us very ready for traditional approval and making sure that people can access these medicines.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris for the questions. Lois, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks for the question. So Dan, I wanted to ask you if you could talk a little bit about where you see the oral GLP-1 space developing and how your product is likely to be positioned. A little bit of this I think is also what you think the unmet need is outside of where the, sort of, very robust weight loss that we see from Mounjaro is. And then just an add-on to that how do you see the oral market developing in terms of other potential agonists? Is that something that Lilly is pursuing and hoping to further develop combinations there as well? Thanks.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan on this question. \nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Seamus. I'll get started. Maybe Mike wants to add on some of the marketplace questions. But clearly obesity is a huge problem in the US and around the world. I think 100 million Americans potentially with obesity and reaching one billion people around the world pretty soon. That's probably not a market that even all of the interested companies could address solely with injectables. So just given the scope of the problem around the world we're going to need orals. Ultimately it's our goal to have orals that can match the safety tolerability and efficacy of injectables. I think our oral GLP-1 is our first attempt in this space and has really good prospects for meeting that initial goal. But then noting of course that the injectables are going to get better over time and the orals will catch up as well. The second part of your question was how do the orals catch up. And I think you're sort of alluding to an obvious issue, which is right now our oral GLP-1 and other orals in the space are single mechanism, single incretin agonists. I think, we've seen with great drugs like Trulicity and competitive products what single agonist against GLP-1 can achieve. It's not as good, I think, as what can be achieved with dual agonism for tirzepatide or hopefully even triple agonism with GGG. And so you can bet, we're working on oral solutions that can bring additional incretin activity to patients in a pill. Nothing ready to disclose today but we're working hard. \nJoe Fletcher: Okay. Thanks, Dan. All right. Lois, next question.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I have two related ones on tirzepatide. Dan I know you have SURMOUNT-4 coming up which is the maintenance study but how has your thinking evolved if at all on the potential duration of tirzepatide use either based on longer exposure from clinical studies or in the real world? And do you think that could inform payer discussions. And then Mike on Mounjaro a moving target, but how does the prescriber base as of today compare with Trulicity. I'm trying to get a sense for maybe the endocrinology versus primary care mix and utilization in obesity? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher : Great. Thank you, Geoff. So we'll go to Dan for the question on SURMOUNT-4 and duration of tirzepatide and then to Mike on the question of how the prescriber base from Mounjaro compares to Trulicity. \nDan Skovronsky : Yes. Sure. As I was just saying I mean obesity is clearly a chronic often lifetime disease. And for such diseases patients often need to take therapy for chronically -- potentially life of the disease here. A lot of times in medicine that doesn't happen of course, people come off of therapies, because either the therapy is working, and they think they don't need anymore or there's a benefit they can't see. I'm not sure either of those are the case for a drug like tirzepatide. People clearly can observe the benefits that the drug is having on their health. And perhaps unfortunately, but not different really than any other drug that we have for any other disease. When you stop taking the drug, it's likely that it can no longer work, and patients may see that as well. So I think those factors will combine to have a pretty long duration of therapy. We have to wait and see in the marketplace maybe Mike has some early signals from patients, but still pretty early on. Anything there, Mike?\nMike Mason : Yes, no hard data yet on that. But qualitatively what we hear is what patients who've used Mounjaro, what they like and what they realize once they start using it is that it really does reduce the appetite, and they enjoy the benefits of reducing appetite. It helps them lose their -- lose weight and stop being as consumed as much during today about 80%. And we do know that when -- what we heard from our investigators and our studies is that when people stop taking Mounjaro that their appetite goes back to the level, it was before. So that's something very noticeable something that a patient values from taking the therapy and then when they stop the therapy, they then see this reversed. And so we do believe that people are going to stop, and see if they can lose weight if they can great. But I do think that they're going to see a very powerful signal very quickly to reinforce going back on the product. So I do think that will help reinforce the chronic use of tirzepatide for type two diabetes, and eventually for obesity if we get approved. The question on Trulicity. Mounjaro if you look at Mounjaro's use right now and compare it to how many customers are using that versus Trulicity at this time, it's a lot broader population than we saw with Trulicity is because the market is a lot bigger a lot more people are riding the treatment. If you compare Mounjaro to the number of Trulicity riders today there are more people riding Trulicity just, because it's been on the market longer. They've gone through the adoption curve and Trulicity has better access, access and especially in Medicaid that drives additional prescribers to use that. So overall I'd say the Mounjaro is within the universe of the doctors who write Trulicity at this point. \nJoe Fletcher : Thank you, Geoff for the question. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nTim Anderson : Thank you. I have a question on donanemab. I'm wondering if Lilly would agree that there is highly likely going to be higher area E and area H rates with your drug versus lecanemab when TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 reports out. The prior data would certainly suggest that. If so, relative to lecanemab, doesn't that create a potential risk benefit conundrum for FDA assuming efficacy comes in around the same levels. I guess the bottom line here is there a regulatory concern to contemplate maybe this is why FDA issued the CRL they want to see the full results from your second study. You don't just want to capture a few more patients to bring that total to 100, or am I being too bearish here? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim, for the question. We'll go to Dan for this.\nDan Skovronsky: Yeah. Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, which is around, why did the FDA issue the CRL. I think that the FDA regulations actually suggest that FDA should list all deficiencies in the CRL. We were pretty explicit copying some of the FDA's own words here to investors about what was in the CRL. It didn't discuss issues like ARIA it was focused on the 12-month exposure. So nothing further to speculate there. I think your question on rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H comparing across drugs is a complicated one. We did this head-to-head study against aducanumab. I think it's important to use studies like that to compare rates of ARIA, because we've learned that grades of ARIA are highly dependent on the type of patients who enroll the stage of disease and underlying pathology, baseline characteristics of their brain scans, which are different across lecanemab trials and genetimib trials, as well as exactly how you do the MRIs and read them. So I'm personally not going to get worked up about rates of asymptomatic radiographic-only ARIA in any drug. I don't think anyone really understands what that means. What we should be focused on though is rates of symptomatic ARIA. So patients who have ARIA that turns into something they experience, not just a radiographic binding and particularly rates of serious adverse events resulting ARIA. We know that in some patients ARIA can be dangerous even fatal as we've seen from lecanemab experiences. So that's what we'll be looking out for. I think we still have all the caveats about cross-trial comparisons here, but it's a bit easier to compare those symptomatic or serious events. I think in TRAILBLAZER-1 our numbers were very similar to other members of the class. In TRAILBLAZER-4, the numbers look very, very good for that. And we'll wait and see what we have in TRAILBLAZER-2. The level of concern over that is not high.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a two part one for me. I guess first on Mounjaro manufacturing. I was just wondering if you can tell us if the FDA has completed the inspection of your new North Carolina facility yet. And then the other question relates to tirzepatide for obesity. I was wondering if you've had any initial payer conversations yet, and if you're planning to use a priority review voucher for that filing? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Terence. I think I'll hand over to Anat for commentary on your manufacturing question and then to Mike on the question about whether there's been any payer conversations on obesity.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Terence, to your question on the RTP side North Carolina, it's progressing on schedule as we had planned. We can't comment on specifics on the FDA interactions, but we're expecting that site to start producing this year and it's progressing towards that goal. I will mention important to think about -- when we talk about RTP, I think because of the proximal nature of when this site is going to come online. Obviously, this is the next large node that's going to come online in terms of capacity for incretins portfolio. But we are making substantial investments beyond RTP. So, we've announced a second site in North Carolina, very large site in Concord, when we've announced the expansion of the RTP site additional sites in India \u2013 or north of Indianapolis and a site in Ireland. And as we look at our capital investments in manufacturing sites this year alone, it's probably the largest we've ever had doubling what we had in 2022. We're looking at about $3.3 billion of investment just this year. So we're looking at substantial expansion of capacity really across the globe to support not just Mounjaro obviously, but the rest of the portfolio and we have visibility into what's coming as well as the fact that, as we've talked about before we have several products that are part of the same manufacturing network, and the same auto-injector platform. So that helps us kind of build that capacity across the Lilly portfolio. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Anat. Mike on the second question?\nMike Mason: Yeah. I think a good thing to focus on is access and obesity. I mean you look at the massive size of the obesity market 110 million people in the US, 650 million people globally but you really see that the historically that the obesity market has really been slow to develop. And it's really because the treatments haven't been adequate. So, the kind of \u2013 the question we had going into this market, was if a safe and efficacious treatment was developed would consumers and health care professionals and payers be interested in using it? Well, based on what we've seen in the marketplace over the past year and on a market research it's clear that consumers and health care professionals will adopt an efficacious safe anti-obesity medication if patients can have access to it. So it does come down to payer access, and we're highly focused on doing that. Noble recently stated in their call that 40 million Americans have access to obesity and the way, they talked about it what's payer access and employers opting into that. So if that's where we're at today that would be a great starting point for access. We're deep into conversations with payers to understand the market and all that. Access discussions haven't started yet, but will shortly. But our focus long term is to improve access for diabetes medications. We are investing significantly to demonstrate the potential health outcome benefits, where people using tirzepatide, who live with obesity. We're also investing in Phase III programs for people, who live with obesity and sleep apnea, or heart failure and they should unlock large segments access for people who live with obesity in commercial and we hope Part D. In addition, in my career, I've seen the power of consumer interest in helping to improve access for medication. And what we've seen over the last year is that, people who live with obesity are highly engaged and willing to do much access effective treatments. They will have an important walls with employers and the congressional representative advocate for access. So, while I think it will take time to establish our ultimate actions goal, I'm more encouraged than ever are potential unlock the obesity market and help a lot of people. So I'm encouraged, but obviously a lot of work still to be done.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, both, and thanks Terence for the question. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. A question for Anat. I'm not going to get the legislative particulars correct. But just to be clear, doesn't Lilly typically guide on tax rate assuming an adverse US situation and doesn't typically adjust that until late in the year. And this year it is assuming no adverse situation but much earlier in the year? If so, can you clarify why you were doing something different this year since it is a profound impact on earnings? And if I could just add on LPA, Dave, Lilly is way behind, how can you catch up? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Steve. I'll go to Anat for the question on the tax rate assumptions, and then I'll go to Dan for your LP little a question.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks Steve. So here is how we look at this and I wouldn't read too much into it. Last year we had assumed based on very broad support for change in this 2017 tax provision, that this will in fact be enacted by Congress. We assumed late in the year, but it hasn't happened. So at this point, the only thing we're doing is reflecting reality of the situation we're in. If it does get repealed or deferred, obviously, we'll update accordingly. I don't think the likelihood of that is zero. So it still could happen this year, but it does take Congress -- Congress will need to add to get this going. So we're simply reflecting the current situation.\nDan Skovronsky: Okay. I'll start with the LP little a question. We have two LP little a programs, so maybe the easiest one to comment on first is the oral program. This is a first-in-class I think, probably the only one in clinic here. An oral medication against this target is really a huge feat of molecular engineering. I'm super excited to see the data from this molecule developed and obviously, the market opportunity for an oral drug for such a widespread condition is very important. In terms of the siRNA, you're right to note that a competitor is ahead of us and really just starting the CVOT study. It's a long road to get these drugs to market with outcome studies are needed here to show the benefit. I probably don't get into our differentiation strategy. But, of course, we have some ideas here and we'll move as quickly as possible. I don't see this as a winner take all space.\nDave Ricks: Maybe just to add -- Steve add on the LP little a comment. I think we feel good about where we are with that. But just on the tax thing, there is a difference here where you described it as adverse or beneficial, right? From a GAAP and non-GAAP accounting, of course, it's a benefit on EPS growth. But actually from a cash perspective, it goes the other way. So we just wanted to be clear upfront, because it's not a one-way benefit we're taking early in the year. There's an adverse cash impact throughout the year and a positive effect on the P&L. It's a little bit different from maybe past assumptions we've made. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Please go ahead.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you, what do you think is the minimum amount of relative risk reduction you'd have to see in an outcome study for obesity for payers to be convinced that there's something here? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Louise. Mike, do you want to chime in on that around the minimum amount of relative risk reduction we'd expect in an outcome study for obesity? \nMike Mason: Yes. That's a good question. I mean first of all, I don't think it's a binary point where all payers are looking for that outcome in order to provide access. I think you're going to see a lot of payers you already see a lot of payers who can provide access for that. And we have an extensive Phase 3 program only in CV outcomes but also the sleep apnea and heart failure to begin to really talk about heart outcomes for many patients who live with obesity. With the CV outcomes that we have today, I mean we're quite confident in our program and based on what we see with surrogate risk reduction and blood pressure and lipids, we're fairly confident in our CV profile as well as what we saw with the SURPASS data and our meta-analysis in the SURPASS program. So I won't give you the exact number, but I think we're pleased with where we're at. And I think we'll be able to demonstrate outcomes that payers will be excited about.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Louis for the question. Lois, next question.\nOperator: And that comes from David Risinger from SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Dave are you there? Okay. Looks like we don't have Dave or he's on mute. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. If I can ask a question on Mounjaro and the interplay with Trulicity. You've commented in the past that in terms of patients on Mounjaro, it has been about less than 10%. That seems to be a little bit higher now. Can you share any thoughts and observations about how you see this progressing on the forward through this year?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Chris for the question. Mike, we'll go to you for that question on the, I guess cannibalization from Trulicity figure and how that will progress.\nMike Mason: Okay. Yeah, I mean on that nothing has changed over what we had talked about earlier that less than 10% of our scripts we get four Mounjaro comfort Trulicity. That hasn't changed over time. It's still a little bit less than 10%.\nChris Shibutani: Okay. Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Lois, next question.\nOperator: And that comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a heightened investor focus I feel along the Phase III primary endpoint for donanemab now. And I wonder if there's been any incremental interactions and/or agreement with FDA on the primary endpoint for Phase III. The question I get a lot from investors. And also how are you thinking about this upcoming Phase III? If there were to be a scenario where the MMRM on CDR doesn't agree with ADAS on a patient analysis? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Umer. We'll go to Dan for the question on endpoints.\nDan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks. Clearly I think there's a lot we can learn from competitor readouts here. And so looking at lecanemab data in our eyes, I think it actually further validates an endpoint like ADAS. If you just look at the forest bot for example there's a lot more homogeneity in effect on an endpoint like ADAS versus CDR Sum of Boxes. So we feel more confident I would say than ever before that endpoint like that is the right way to go. On the other hand I think the -- you could take the position that since lecanemab hit CDR Sum of Boxes people might say, well then it's achievable and you guys should do it too. So there's some pushes and some takes there. But on the whole still feeling good about ADAS as a primary outcome. When you ask though what happens if you hit one outcome and not the other. That's surely a difficult situation to be in. We want to understand why that happened. If that were to happen where the irregularities in CDR Sum of Boxes that could explain it what did the rest of the secondaries look like. Always best to hit all of your outcomes in a clinical trial. Feeling that you want to hit your primary in as many secondaries as possible. So let's wait and see.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Umer. Lois, next question.\nOperator: That question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe a question regarding your next-generation Alzheimer's drug. I cannot pronounce the name remternetug I'll learn it. But how does it differ or similar versus donanemab? Asking -- because I mean you're running a Phase III trial with subcu here. So what would be the read through for this particular asset based on the outcome of donanemab Phase III trial? \nJoe Fletcher: Dan, do you want to talk a little bit about remternetug? \nDan Skovronsky: Yes. I think ,you've got it basically, right. Remternetug is a new medicine, a new molecule, but it's an antibody against the same type of epitope that donanemab has which is this N3pG form of a beta. So a very equivalent mechanism of action. Maybe a little better potency and certainly better drug properties including, no ADAs and formulation things. So the rationale here is to give improved dosing options to patients. Could we get even faster plaque clearance, could it be with fewer doses, could it be subcutaneous. Those are the types of things, that we're currently exploring. The Phase III is designed with a bit of a run-in, were in that portion right now to finalize our dosing strategy and then expand it. Obviously, if donanemab is disappointing there would be read-through remternetug. On the other hand, if donanemab exceeds expectations, I would expect that to read through as well. \nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Mohit, Next question.\nOperator: The next question is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead. \nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. While much of the discussion on Medicare coverage in Alzheimer's, we know that Medicare really doesn't pay for obesity drugs. Can you just talk about your efforts to help Medicare patients get coverage for obesity drugs including, potentially Mounjaro if approved. Maybe add some parameters around, what that additional population could look like from a revenue opportunity perspective. Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan for the question. I'll hand over to Mike. Mike, do you want to talk about the potential for Medicare to cover obesity? \nMike Mason: Okay. Sure. Yes, good question. I mean, it's going to take less late action in order to allow diabetes medications to be covered on Medicare Part D. So there is the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act. The acronym for that is TROA. And there's a large growing bipartisan support for TROA, a little over 100 congressmen, senators, people senators are behind the program. And it's growing more and more support across Washington. We're eager to see an advanced list process. It would be great for the company country. America needs to take action and drastic reduce the number of people in the DC and this oscillation would be an important step for this goal. We'll support the translation and continue to work, to advocate for it. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nTrung Huynh: Thanks for squeezing me in. I\u2019m Trung Huynh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Last month the American Academy of Pediatrics released their guidelines to treat childhood obesity. In those guidelines, they recommended a lifestyle intervention obviously, is the core component. But also they said, they would consider treatment with anti-obesity medications. So I thought, what's your thoughts on anti-obesity medications in children? Is this a scenario that you are moving into or considering moving into? Do you have any trials with children or adolescents? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Trung for the question. Mike over to you again comment on these recent guidelines that were put out. \nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks. I mean this is a significant unmet need. Back to the question that we asked earlier about the Treat Reduce Obesity Act. We need to prove the health of America. We have too many people who live with obesity in the US and that includes unfortunately adolescents and feeds. So, I think they took the right action in order to really identify this as an issue that healthcare professionals do need to pay close attention to. We obviously always advocate for diet and exercise is the first approach of this. But if that's not successful then you really only option at that point is medication treatment. We do think it's important and responsible for us to test the appetite in feed and adolescents and we have activity ongoing to do that.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Mike and thanks Trung for the question. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nCarter Gould: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I guess one for Anat. Back in December, you highlighted austerity measures in Europe as a potential risk. At that time that was a bit of a unique position. We hadn't heard that from many companies since that time. We've heard kind of similar messaging from some but not all. And apologies if I missed it I don't think I heard anything today on this front. So, I know it's only been sort of 45 days or so since you made those comments, but any advances in sort of how you're thinking about this? And any specific products or countries we should think about that impact? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Carter for the question. I'm actually going to hand this over to Ilya Yuffa, who's our President of Lilly International to comment on the European austerity measures.\nIlya Yuffa: Yes, I appreciate the question. There have been a number of markets in Europe that have taken some austerity measures, partially due to Ukraine crisis and energy crisis and inflation in Europe. We have seen Germany, France, obviously, the UK, voluntary system we think is broken and so we exited that. And so we -- there are some austerity measures in there. We've contemplated that into our guidance for 2023. And the overall impact is modest relative to historical declines in price in prior years. We expect that to continue to be in that mid-single-digit decline in price in Europe.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Ilya. Thanks Carter for the question. Lois, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Thank you. A question on US commercial access for GLP-1 agonist. First, could you share with us how you're thinking about modeling the impact of the IRA in terms of GLP-1 uptake increasing as a result of the co-pay cap? And additionally benefiting from the reduction in free drug program. How significant is it given the patients still got to find $2,000 per annum? And then second, in relation to the oral DPP-4 market which is still a very, very substantial $14 billion market. You have a category of drugs extensively which may offer considerable advantages in efficacy for glycemia and white. But I'm reminded of the stickiness of the [indiscernible] in the prior period. To what extent do you think managed market is going to preclude your ability to penetrate that segment with oral GLP-1s just on the basis of generic DPP-4s? thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Andrew for the wide-ranging question on diabetes. I'll hand over to Mike first to talk about your question regarding potential impact of the IRA on access for GLP-1. And then the second question around how oral GLP might fit in given the stickiness of some of the older diabetes medications. Mike? \nMike Mason: Yes. Good questions. On the IRA side of it, it will benefit patients who live with diabetes who use GLPs and are Medicare Part D the outpace cost will go down. We have I would say a small or moderate impact on GLP sales or just probably lower rates of abandonment than what we'd see at higher out-of-pocket costs. As it comes to the oral DPP4 the perceptions of oral DPP-4 have really declined over the last five years and really being replaced by ST2s and GLP lose. So I don't see much of an impact of DPP-4s going off path in the US or other markets. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. And Lois, I think we have one final question in the queue. So let's go to the last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was just thinking more about some of the launches that are coming up but I know the maybe a little bit out. But for Mirikizumab and I always get this wrong, sorry. But for UC, can you just talk a little bit about given how much promotion there's been for [indiscernible] as you move into also Crohn's with data reading out soon. Like how do you see like competing in that market? Can you start launching? Do you have to be DTC heavy because it seems like they're very prominent. Like what about the launch dynamics. And then second for lebrikizumab the same question here. Atopic dermatitis is getting pretty crowded. What kind of pushes and pulls might you need to use to get quicker uptake in atopic derm? Thanks.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Robyn for the questions. I will go to Patrick Johnson for both of these first on mirikizumab and competition in the UC market and then on lebrikizumab. Patrick? \nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much. Well, overall we feel very good with the data we have seen on mirikizumab. If we look at the 52 weeks, we have more than 50% clinical remission and we see statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both clinical, symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic endpoints. What I think is important that if you look at the patient populations with ulcerative colitis, we saw the same results across the bionaive and the bio failure patients. So I think we're extremely well positioned for the launch here. We also demonstrated on a factor but it's extremely important for patients or agency. More than 40% of patients were either completely or almost our urgency at week 52. So therefore, we believe we have a first-in-class asset here that probably initially will be used mainly second line for those that haven't responded appropriately to TNFs and similar. But we believe that long-term, we are positioned for a first-line placement in treatment of ulcerative colitis. And yes, so the outlook for mirikizumab. It's exciting from a competitive landscape perspective, we don't have bad to have data. But if we compare the data we have seen so far, we believe that mirikizumab compares very favorable both versus what's currently in the marketplace as well as what's in the pipeline with other companies across JAK inhibitors S1Ps and other IL-23s as well. So exciting to launch mirikizumab the first half of this year. When it comes to lebri, I think actually, we are uniquely positioned to really upgrade the expected outcomes of patients with atopic dermatitis. We have here an asset that is actually targeting the most relevant cytokine when it comes to treating atopic dermatitis, IL-13 and it does that with a high binding affinity, high potency and a slow off rate. And I think that probably explains the data that we have seen so far. We're extremely pleased with the Phase III data, and we sold more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at Week 16, maintaining that at Week 52, but also very importantly, statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both each, which is probably the most disturbing factor for patients with atopic dermatitis, sleep and quality of life. And we saw similar results across both the Q2W and Q4W formulation. We actually believe that lebrikizumab has the potential to become a first-line biologic. It's important to have in mind that we announced the submission at the Q3 earnings call, and we expect that traditional regulatory pathway. Yes, we will not launch until most likely Q4 of 2023. But a lot of excitement from both health care providers and tier community as well on the payers to get leverage to the market.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Patrick. Dave, to wrap up?\nDave Ricks: Great. I think that's the last question. I appreciate the questions across the portfolio. And we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. 2022 was another productive year for the company, and we generated strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients we serve. We aim to continue our momentum in 2023 and execute on the meaningful launch and pipeline opportunities that we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in, and please follow up with IR, if you have questions that we didn't get to you today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Joe. 2022 as a year of strong pipeline and commercial performance for Lilly. We delivered top and bottom line growth in 2022 despite the impact of the Alimta LOE in the US and significant FX headwinds and delivered another remarkable year of pipeline progress. We began 2023 with multiple updates to our late-stage pipeline. In our Q2 2022 earnings call last August, we announced the filing of submissions for two assets with the FDA under an accelerated approval pathway, pirtobrutinib in mantle cell lymphoma and donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Last month, we received response from the FDA on both these assets. On January 19, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for accelerated approval of donanemab due to the limited number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. There were no other deficiencies cited. We will continue to work with the FDA to evaluate the best pathway to make this potential treatment option available to patients and look forward to results next quarter for the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III confirmatory trial, which will form the basis of donanemab's application for traditional approval. We have consistently stated that, we would expect very limited uptake before CMS supports coverage. At the time we submitted for accelerated approval, we had hoped that there would be more movement from CMS to provide access to these medicines for people with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, this has not yet materialized. We maintain conviction that given the impact of this devastating disease and significant unmet need, positive confirmatory data and FDA traditional approval should be sufficient to support global reimbursement and patient access necessary for broad use of donanemab over time. Also in the month of January, we received FDA approval for Jaypirca, the first and only non-covalent BTK inhibitor, for adults with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy, including a BTK inhibitor. Jaypirca is a highly selective kinase inhibitor, is novel reversible binding mechanism and pharmacology may allow for extended targeting of the BTK pathway, following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor. We are pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we remain confident in the long-term opportunity for donanemab. We also look forward to the potential launch of two of our immunology assets later this year with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab and of tirzepatide for obesity. This current wave of new launches along with the ongoing focus and progress in our next wave of R&D innovation underpins our long-term outlook to drive top-tier revenue growth and expand our margins over time. On slide 4 you can see the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue on a constant currency basis grew 10% in Q4 and 5% for the full year. Volume in our core business, again, excluding COVID-19 antibodies, grew 13% in Q4 and 12% for the year. This volume-driven performance was attributed to our key growth products, which grew 21% last quarter. For pipeline milestones, in addition to the recent FDA approval of Jaypirca, we have shared several important updates since our Q3 earnings call. Positive Phase 3 readout and FDA and EMA acceptance of the regulatory submission for Jardiance for adults with chronic kidney disease, the initiation of a rolling submission in the US for tirzepatide in obesity, and FDA granting a Fast Track designation for tirzepatide in obstructive sleep apnea. We also continue to put our cash flow to work to create long-term value. In late January, we announced plans to invest an additional $450 million for expansion of our Research Triangle Park manufacturing site in North Carolina, to further augment our manufacturing capacity for the years ahead. On the business development front, we closed the acquisition of Akouos to expand our gene therapy capability and we entered into a strategic research collaborations with a focus on new modalities and technologies. Finally, we continue to return capital to investors. In Q4 we distributed nearly $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and we announced a 15% increase to the dividend for the fifth consecutive year. Moving to slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, business development and ESG updates we are discussing today or that were discussed during our guidance call on December 13. One item I'd like to highlight is the collaboration we announced in December with EVA Pharma to deliver a sustainable supply of affordable high-quality insulin to at least one million people living with diabetes in low to middle-income countries, most of which are in Africa. This is an important collaboration with a local company to produce low quality -- or low-cost high-quality medicines. Strengthening capacity and building self-reliance for insulin manufacturing within the African region will provide a more sustainable supply in the long term. With this agreement, Lilly will sell insulin API to EVA Pharma at a significantly reduced price and provide pro-bono technology transfer to enable EVA to formulate fill and finish insulin vials and cartridges. We're proud to be a part of this novel arrangement, which aligns with our 30x30 goal of improving access to quality healthcare for 30 million people, living in limited resource settings annually by 2030. Now, I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 and full year 2022 results. Thanks Dan. Before we move to Q&A, let me summarize the progress we made during 2022. We delivered strong revenue growth in our core business, propelled by our key growth products. We launched Mounjaro for patients with type two diabetes, while advancing and expanding our development program for tirzepatide, including the start of the SURMOUNT-MMO outcome study and the initiation of a rolling submission for chronic weight management. In 2022, we submitted regulatory applications for important pipeline products like mirikizumab, pirtobrutinib and lebrikizumab. And in 2023, we've already received approval for Jaypirca and are poised to advance donanemab in the regulatory process assuming positive data from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ-2 Phase III study. In addition, we continue to invest in our pipeline, our capacity, our capabilities and our people. Finally, we returned $5 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. And for the fifth consecutive year, announced a 15% dividend increase for 2023. With continued growth in Mounjaro and our key products, including Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz, we expect our core business revenue to grow by mid-teens in 2023. We are energized by the launch opportunities before us this year and no strong launch execution is key to our long-term success. Taken together, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver top-tier revenue growth through at least 2030 and to deliver on Lilly's mission to make life better for people around the world. So now, I'll turn it over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Colin. We'll go to Mike for the first question on gross to net and price for Mounjaro and then hand over to Dan for kind of broader obesity mechanistic commentary. Mike? Thanks, Chris. All right. We'll go to Mike for the question about Mounjaro price kind of over time and how it might compare to Trulicity. And then to Anne on your donanemab question about activity that would occur to ramp up HCP education. Mike? Thanks, Mike. Anne? Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dan on this question. Maybe just to add -- Steve add on the LP little a comment. I think we feel good about where we are with that. But just on the tax thing, there is a difference here where you described it as adverse or beneficial, right? From a GAAP and non-GAAP accounting, of course, it's a benefit on EPS growth. But actually from a cash perspective, it goes the other way. So we just wanted to be clear upfront, because it's not a one-way benefit we're taking early in the year. There's an adverse cash impact throughout the year and a positive effect on the P&L. It's a little bit different from maybe past assumptions we've made. Lois, next question. Great. I think that's the last question. I appreciate the questions across the portfolio. And we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. 2022 was another productive year for the company, and we generated strong financial results and delivered important pipeline progress in each of our core therapeutic areas on behalf of the patients we serve. We aim to continue our momentum in 2023 and execute on the meaningful launch and pipeline opportunities that we have ahead of us. So thanks for dialing in, and please follow up with IR, if you have questions that we didn't get to you today. Have a great day."

            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks Dave. Slide 6 and 7 summarize financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. As Dave mentioned, we're pleased to report 10% growth for our core business in Q4 on a constant currency basis, driven by strong volume growth. A couple of notable items affected year-over-year comparisons. The first is COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q4 2022, which compared to the prior year declined 96% from approximately $1.1 billion in Q4 2021 to $38 million in Q4 2022. Biptimozumab is currently not authorized for emergency use in any US region and we continue to expect no COVID-19 antibody revenue for 2023. Second is the continued foreign exchange headwinds compared to 2021, which resulted in a 45-basis point dampening of revenue growth in Q4. Key growth products grew by 21% and accounted for 70% of our revenue this quarter. For the full year 2022, revenue excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies grew 2% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 80.5% in Q4, an increase of approximately 440 basis points, primarily driven by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized price and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs. Total operating expenses declined 1% in Q4, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were largely offset by higher marketing, selling, and administrative expenses and higher R&D expenses. Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3% in Q4, primarily driven by costs supporting the launch of new products and indications, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expense for the quarter increased 5%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income declined 7% compared to Q4 2021, driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating margin for Q4 was 27.4%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 330 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Full year operating margin was 27.8% an increase from 26.8% in 2021. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 7.3%, bringing our full year 2022 effective tax rate to 10.3%. As we shared during our guidance call in December, we had assumed that the 2017 Tax Act provision for requiring capitalization, amortization of research, and development expenses for tax purposes would be deferred or repealed by Congress in late 2022. However, no legislative action was taken related to this provision, which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for 2022 versus the guidance range previously shared. In addition this provision did increase our tax payments in 2022 by approximately $1.2 billion. At the bottom-line earnings per share declined 4% in Q4 and increased 7% for the full year. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth across key geographies. This quarter US revenue declined 10%. Excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the US. The swap volume-driven growth was led by Verzenio, Mounjaro, and Jardiance. Net price was flat in the US this quarter. For the full year, the net price decrease of 3% in the US was in line with our expectation. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q4, increased 8% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Jardiance Trulicity and Verzenio. We remain encouraged with the momentum of our business in Europe. In Japan, revenue in Q4 decreased 6% in constant currency. Revenue growth in Japan continues to be negatively impacted, albeit less so than in prior quarters by decreased demand for several products that have lost patent exclusivity including, the Alimta and Cymbalta. We expect to return to growth this year, as we scale key products and launch Mounjaro. In China, revenue grew 2% in constant currency, as continued volume growth was mostly offset by lower realized prices for Humalog, as a result of the volume-based procurement process and for products listed on the NRDL as well as by COVID-19 disruption. Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 11% in constant currency this quarter, driven by approximately $130 million of onetime revenue associated with the sales of the company's right to Alimta in Korea and Taiwan. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth, contributing 15% points of volume growth this quarter. As mentioned previously, the decline in COVID-19 antibody volume, was substantial in Q4 2022 and was largely offset -- and largely offset volume growth from key products. While we will face similar prior period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue through the first three quarters of 2023, our long-term growth prospects are underpinned by our innovative pipeline and key growth products including Mounjaro. Slide 10, further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands grew 21% or 27% in constant currency generated $5.1 billion in sales and made up 70% of our total revenue. While Lilly's incretins portfolio understandably generates high interest, we continue to see tremendous growth both in percentage and absolute terms, for other key products including Verzenio and Jardiance. Verzenio sales in the quarter grew 100%, driven mainly by the edge of an indication. Jardiance sales grew 42% and the product retains the leadership position, in a competitive market globally. Demand for our incretins portfolio remains strong both for Trulicity globally and Mounjaro in the US, and we remain focused on bringing additional capacity online to meet this robust demand in upcoming launches. In terms of supply, as mentioned in our guidance call in December, given strong demand for incretins products. There have been intermittent delays at wholesalers and pharmacies and receiving certain doses levels of Mounjaro and Trulicity in the US. We continue to update the FDA on the situation, and the FDA has been posting to his website details regarding affected doses and expected timing. To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretins business, we have announced plans to add additional, substantial capacity in the years ahead. The most proximal of these efforts, is our RTP side North Carolina where progress continues as planned and we look forward to the start of production later this year. Moving to Slide 11. Mounjaro's strong launch uptake continues, underpinned by differentiated efficacy profile, and positive customer experiences. For Q4, approximately 75% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts, are patients new to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretins class and further 10% of switches from Trulicity. As we mentioned in our Q3 earnings call in early November, we took actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of the Mounjaro savings program, by type 2 diabetes patients. We indicated at that time that these actions could negatively impact new prescription volumes, but were not expected to impact net revenue. As anticipated, we believe the new prescription volumes beginning in late November were impacted by these actions with some week-by-week volatility driven by end of year seasonality. We continue to build payer access for Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of January 1st AXIS [ph] stands just over 50% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. Regarding the percentage of paid scripts. For Q4 we estimate the percentage of paid script from Mounjaro to be approximately 40% with paid script defined as those prescription outside the 25 non-covered co-pay cards, but inclusive of the 25 covered co-pay card. As we expand payer access, the proportion of paid scripts should continue to increase. On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In 2022, we invested $9.6 billion to drive future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investment. In addition, we returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged and are oriented towards achieving our strategic deliverables of top-tier revenue growth and speeding life changing medicines to patients. We do this through investments in our current portfolio to drive new launches, investment in our manufacturing capacity in our future innovation through R&D and business development. And we returned capital to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. Slide 13 provides an updated 2023 financial guidance. The only change we've made from the guidance we provided in December is to update our effective tax rate, which result in an updated EPS range. During December guidance call, we shared that the effective tax rate for 2023 would be approximately 16% based on the assumed deferral or repeal of the tax provision requiring capitalization of R&D. Since this provision was not deferred or repealed in 2022 and given the uncertainty around if and when such action will take place in 2023, we have updated our tax rate from 16% to approximately 13%. This update to our effective tax rate results in new EPS range of $7.90 to $8.10 on a GAAP basis and $8.35 to $8.55 on a non-GAAP basis. Regarding FX rates there has been a general weakening of the dollar since we set our initial 2023 financial guidance last year. However, we're not adjusting guidance for FX changes at this time as we're only one month into the year and FX markets can be quite volatile. As I shared in December, the most significant headwind in revenue growth in 2023 versus 2022 will be the impact of COVID-19 antibody sales. This year-over-year comparisons will be most pronounced in Q1 2023 given that we had $1.5 billion of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q1 2022. To a lesser extent the loss of exclusivity of Alimta in the US in Q2 2022 will also impact year-over-year growth in the first half of 2023. Still the midpoint of our 2023 revenue guidance range represents roughly 7% of growth or 50% growth for our core business excluding COVID-19 antibodies. This year holds tremendous promise for us to help patients as we execute on the current wave of potential launches while maintaining our commitment to invest in and progress future innovation. We expect this ongoing focus on disciplined execution and investment will help drive top two revenue growth through 2030. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan, to provide an update on our pipeline. Terence, to your question on the RTP side North Carolina, it's progressing on schedule as we had planned. We can't comment on specifics on the FDA interactions, but we're expecting that site to start producing this year and it's progressing towards that goal. I will mention important to think about -- when we talk about RTP, I think because of the proximal nature of when this site is going to come online. Obviously, this is the next large node that's going to come online in terms of capacity for incretins portfolio. But we are making substantial investments beyond RTP. So, we've announced a second site in North Carolina, very large site in Concord, when we've announced the expansion of the RTP site additional sites in India \u2013 or north of Indianapolis and a site in Ireland. And as we look at our capital investments in manufacturing sites this year alone, it's probably the largest we've ever had doubling what we had in 2022. We're looking at about $3.3 billion of investment just this year. So we're looking at substantial expansion of capacity really across the globe to support not just Mounjaro obviously, but the rest of the portfolio and we have visibility into what's coming as well as the fact that, as we've talked about before we have several products that are part of the same manufacturing network, and the same auto-injector platform. So that helps us kind of build that capacity across the Lilly portfolio. Thanks Steve. So here is how we look at this and I wouldn't read too much into it. Last year we had assumed based on very broad support for change in this 2017 tax provision, that this will in fact be enacted by Congress. We assumed late in the year, but it hasn't happened. So at this point, the only thing we're doing is reflecting reality of the situation we're in. If it does get repealed or deferred, obviously, we'll update accordingly. I don't think the likelihood of that is zero. So it still could happen this year, but it does take Congress -- Congress will need to add to get this going. So we're simply reflecting the current situation."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Chris for the question on physician education and readiness. So as you said, the accelerate approval is not going to provide access for the vast majority of patients. So it doesn't impact us in that way. And obviously, accelerate approval would have made it maybe a little bit easier to do some of the things that we wanted to do, but there's still a great deal that we can do actually have been doing to make sure that the healthcare system is ready for these medicines. So we begin working on that, things such as developing the diagnostic ecosystem are incredibly important, making sure that there's better integrated Alzheimer's disease pathways to make sure that physicians can properly identify refer infuse these patients. So that's the area of focus right now. Certainly diagnostics are a key area of focus for Lilly. We've continued to expand our PET network to make sure that we're ready for patient diagnosis. And then as well we continue to be committed to PTAL blood tests and intend to launch that this year. So many things going on that I think can make us very ready for traditional approval and making sure that people can access these medicines."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mike Mason",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. I think the best way to answer that is to take a look at what we saw as kind of our Mounjaro paid scripts in Q4 and then how we think that will progress over '23. In the fourth quarter, we classify about 40% of Mounjaro scripts as paid, which we defined as patients that aren't supported by our $25 non-coverage savings program. In our savings program, as we discussed at launch was designed to bridge people living with type 2 diabetes to access. As we discussed in the Q3 earnings call, we have adjusted a program to better ensure, it's being used for people living only with type 2 diabetes. These adjustments included removing our $25 non-covered benefit from our savings card for new patients. We didn't make any adjustments for existing patients who are seeing these cards are set to expire on June of this year, June 30. As expected, these changes have reduced new patient start volume, while increasing the percent of new patients with a history of diabetes treatments and the percent with formulary coverage. I think the way I would look at our savings program right now for new patients is that, we have graduated from the bridging program and now are kind of the type of savings program, really focused on covered patients that you would do in kind of a normalized cycle of a product. So thus we expect that Mounjaro's percent of paid scripts and a net revenue per script to increase through 2023, as we continue to increase access and grow new starts. We remain disciplined in our access discussions so we can maximize long-term value. From the start, our value our approach was to make sure that we capture value in the long-term versus the short term and we've remained very disciplined on that. We have just over 50% access for lives in Part D and commercial segments for people living with type 2 diabetes We're very pleased where we're at on the access front and where the way our contracting has turned out at this point. So hopefully that helps provide some color to our gross to net in Q4. Thanks. Yes, thanks for the question. I can't get into roles about our net price for obvious reasons but maybe I'll address the question this way. I mean if you look at \u2013 when we have - when we reach \u2013 we think we'll reach broad access for Mounjaro and reach ultimately similar access levels that we have for Trulicity. There's nothing differently about how we'll promote or how to support patients on Mounjaro versus Trulicity. So at the end of the day it will come down to our net price negotiations with payers. We believe that Mounjaro has a better profile. We invest a lot of innovation in there. And we do believe that it should have a better net price than Trulicity. Yes, no hard data yet on that. But qualitatively what we hear is what patients who've used Mounjaro, what they like and what they realize once they start using it is that it really does reduce the appetite, and they enjoy the benefits of reducing appetite. It helps them lose their -- lose weight and stop being as consumed as much during today about 80%. And we do know that when -- what we heard from our investigators and our studies is that when people stop taking Mounjaro that their appetite goes back to the level, it was before. So that's something very noticeable something that a patient values from taking the therapy and then when they stop the therapy, they then see this reversed. And so we do believe that people are going to stop, and see if they can lose weight if they can great. But I do think that they're going to see a very powerful signal very quickly to reinforce going back on the product. So I do think that will help reinforce the chronic use of tirzepatide for type two diabetes, and eventually for obesity if we get approved. The question on Trulicity. Mounjaro if you look at Mounjaro's use right now and compare it to how many customers are using that versus Trulicity at this time, it's a lot broader population than we saw with Trulicity is because the market is a lot bigger a lot more people are riding the treatment. If you compare Mounjaro to the number of Trulicity riders today there are more people riding Trulicity just, because it's been on the market longer. They've gone through the adoption curve and Trulicity has better access, access and especially in Medicaid that drives additional prescribers to use that. So overall I'd say the Mounjaro is within the universe of the doctors who write Trulicity at this point. Yeah. I think a good thing to focus on is access and obesity. I mean you look at the massive size of the obesity market 110 million people in the US, 650 million people globally but you really see that the historically that the obesity market has really been slow to develop. And it's really because the treatments haven't been adequate. So, the kind of \u2013 the question we had going into this market, was if a safe and efficacious treatment was developed would consumers and health care professionals and payers be interested in using it? Well, based on what we've seen in the marketplace over the past year and on a market research it's clear that consumers and health care professionals will adopt an efficacious safe anti-obesity medication if patients can have access to it. So it does come down to payer access, and we're highly focused on doing that. Noble recently stated in their call that 40 million Americans have access to obesity and the way, they talked about it what's payer access and employers opting into that. So if that's where we're at today that would be a great starting point for access. We're deep into conversations with payers to understand the market and all that. Access discussions haven't started yet, but will shortly. But our focus long term is to improve access for diabetes medications. We are investing significantly to demonstrate the potential health outcome benefits, where people using tirzepatide, who live with obesity. We're also investing in Phase III programs for people, who live with obesity and sleep apnea, or heart failure and they should unlock large segments access for people who live with obesity in commercial and we hope Part D. In addition, in my career, I've seen the power of consumer interest in helping to improve access for medication. And what we've seen over the last year is that, people who live with obesity are highly engaged and willing to do much access effective treatments. They will have an important walls with employers and the congressional representative advocate for access. So, while I think it will take time to establish our ultimate actions goal, I'm more encouraged than ever are potential unlock the obesity market and help a lot of people. So I'm encouraged, but obviously a lot of work still to be done. Yes. That's a good question. I mean first of all, I don't think it's a binary point where all payers are looking for that outcome in order to provide access. I think you're going to see a lot of payers you already see a lot of payers who can provide access for that. And we have an extensive Phase 3 program only in CV outcomes but also the sleep apnea and heart failure to begin to really talk about heart outcomes for many patients who live with obesity. With the CV outcomes that we have today, I mean we're quite confident in our program and based on what we see with surrogate risk reduction and blood pressure and lipids, we're fairly confident in our CV profile as well as what we saw with the SURPASS data and our meta-analysis in the SURPASS program. So I won't give you the exact number, but I think we're pleased with where we're at. And I think we'll be able to demonstrate outcomes that payers will be excited about. Okay. Yeah, I mean on that nothing has changed over what we had talked about earlier that less than 10% of our scripts we get four Mounjaro comfort Trulicity. That hasn't changed over time. It's still a little bit less than 10%. Okay. Sure. Yes, good question. I mean, it's going to take less late action in order to allow diabetes medications to be covered on Medicare Part D. So there is the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act. The acronym for that is TROA. And there's a large growing bipartisan support for TROA, a little over 100 congressmen, senators, people senators are behind the program. And it's growing more and more support across Washington. We're eager to see an advanced list process. It would be great for the company country. America needs to take action and drastic reduce the number of people in the DC and this oscillation would be an important step for this goal. We'll support the translation and continue to work, to advocate for it. Yes. Thanks. I mean this is a significant unmet need. Back to the question that we asked earlier about the Treat Reduce Obesity Act. We need to prove the health of America. We have too many people who live with obesity in the US and that includes unfortunately adolescents and feeds. So, I think they took the right action in order to really identify this as an issue that healthcare professionals do need to pay close attention to. We obviously always advocate for diet and exercise is the first approach of this. But if that's not successful then you really only option at that point is medication treatment. We do think it's important and responsible for us to test the appetite in feed and adolescents and we have activity ongoing to do that. Yes. Good questions. On the IRA side of it, it will benefit patients who live with diabetes who use GLPs and are Medicare Part D the outpace cost will go down. We have I would say a small or moderate impact on GLP sales or just probably lower rates of abandonment than what we'd see at higher out-of-pocket costs. As it comes to the oral DPP4 the perceptions of oral DPP-4 have really declined over the last five years and really being replaced by ST2s and GLP lose. So I don't see much of an impact of DPP-4s going off path in the US or other markets."

            "content": "Thanks Anat. 2022 was a really productive year for Lilly R&Ds. We advanced our late-stage assets of tirzepatide, donanemab, pirtobrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab to key regulatory submissions and we obtained the approval for Mounjaro. We launched Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes in mid-2022. As Dave shared, we received an approval last week for pirtobrutinib now known as Jaypirca. By the end of this year, we also have the potential to launch two new immunology assets with mirikizumab and lebrikizumab. And for ganitumab, we're looking forward to our Phase III readout mid-year, which if positive will form the basis of our submission for traditional approval. In 2022, we also gained clarity on the next wave of assets that have entered or will soon enter Phase III registrational trials. Those are our SERD in breast cancer, our weekly insulin for diabetes, remternetug in Alzheimer's disease and as shared in our December guidance call, we now have Orforglipron and Retatrutide in diabetes and obesity. Given the updates we provided in mid-December, today I'll just briefly highlight progress since our last earnings call. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of January 30th and slides 15 and 16, show a recap of 2022 key events and potential key events for 2023. Starting with diabetes and cardiometabolic disease, in November, we shared results from the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase III trial, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, as the largest and broadest SGLT2 inhibitor trial in CKD to-date. The results showed a significant benefit of Jardiance, in reducing the relative risk of kidney disease progression or cardiovascular death by 28% compared with placebo in people with chronic kidney disease. The overall safety data were consistent with previous findings confirming the well-established safety profile of Jardiance. CKD is a leading cause of death worldwide, affecting over 850 million people globally and 37 million in the U.S. We've submitted to the FDA and EMA for approval and expect to make submissions to other regulatory agencies in the coming months. In January we started QWINT-1, a Phase III study comparing fixed dose escalation of Lilly's weekly insulin to Insulin Glargine, in insulin-naive type 2 diabetes patients. With this initiation all five studies in the QWINT Phase III program are now underway. Moving to earlier stage assets in our Diabetes and CV pipeline, in Q4 we advanced two assets into Phase II, that aim to lower Lp(a), a well-known risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The first is an oral inhibitor, a small molecule that disrupts the interaction between the apoA protein and the lipoprotein particle and the second uses siRNA to disrupt the production of apoA in the liver. We shared proof-of-concept data on the siRNA asset during our December 2021 R&D Investor Meeting. This is our second siRNA asset to advance to Phase II, following our ANGPTL3 siRNA, which entered Phase II earlier in 2022. We also recently moved an siRNA asset targeting ApoC-III in cardiovascular disease into Phase I. Our genetic medicines portfolio is advancing and we remain optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes with these molecules. Lastly, we discontinued our Phase I KHK inhibitor. In oncology, we're of course pleased with the recent approval of Jaypirca and we look forward to continuing the substantial ongoing development program for the molecule in the years ahead. Jaypirca is the second product approved from our 2019 Loxo Oncology acquisition, which reshaped our oncology efforts at Lilly. Loxo at Lilly's growing NME portfolio now includes a number of emerging assets shown in our pipeline, including our FGFR3 program which recently dosed its first patient. Also, in Q4, we dosed the first patient in EMBER-4, our second Phase III trial for imlunestrant, our oral SERD. EMBER-4 will study imlunestrant in the adjuvant setting. As a sequential monotherapy in patients who previously received two to five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy for ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer with increased risk of recurrence. Lastly turning to Verzenio. As noted in our guidance call at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December, we shared the latest interim analysis for monarchE, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. We've now submitted an sNDA to the US FDA to potentially expand our adjuvant indication beyond the currently indicated Cohort 1 KI-67 greater than 20% population. In immunology, we're looking forward to potential FDA approvals later this year for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis, which we expect in the first half of the year and lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis, which we expect in the second half of the year. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, as mentioned in our guidance call, we presented exciting proof-of-concept results for our PD-1 agonist antibody peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis at the ACR conference in November and we have now initiated a global dose-ranging Phase IIb study. Moving to neuroscience. We've advanced into Phase II our P2X7 inhibitor for chronic pain. Lilly acquired rights to this asset from Asahi Kasei Pharma in early 2021. With regards to donanemab. As Dave mentioned, the sole efficiency cited by the FDA to our submission for accelerated approval was a number of patients with at least 12 months of drug exposure. The Phase II TRAILBLAZER-ALZ trial on which the accelerated approval application was based, allowed patients to complete their course of treatment with donanemab when they reached a predefined level of amyloid plaque clearance. Due to the speed of plaque reduction that we saw, many patients were able to stop dosing as early as six months into treatment, resulting in fewer patients receiving 12 months or more of donanemab dosing. We remain confident in the potential donanemab as a new treatment for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and look forward to sharing results from the Phase III TRABLASER-ALZ-2 study in Q2 of this year. In summary, while 2022 was an outstanding year of pipeline progress, we're fully focused on the work we need to do in 2023 to make our next set of potential medicines a reality for patients. We look forward to providing additional updates throughout the year. Now I turn the call back to Dave. Thanks, Colin for your question on future mechanisms for treating obesity. I can assure you we're not done innovating on behalf of people with obesity. There's a lot we can still do. I think keep your eyes open for more to come from Lilly labs on incretins and related types of mechanisms, but also broadly interested in a variety of new non-incretins-based mechanisms. You specifically asked about one mitochondrial uncoupling but there are several others, I think that also have promise for patients. I just sort of put a note of caution though treating obesity we need to have a very high bar for the types of medicines we develop, remembering that this is a chronic often lifetime disease and highly prevalent population. We need medicines that first and foremost are extremely safe and really highly well tolerated for patients. So that's what we're looking for in future mechanisms. Thanks, Seamus. I'll get started. Maybe Mike wants to add on some of the marketplace questions. But clearly obesity is a huge problem in the US and around the world. I think 100 million Americans potentially with obesity and reaching one billion people around the world pretty soon. That's probably not a market that even all of the interested companies could address solely with injectables. So just given the scope of the problem around the world we're going to need orals. Ultimately it's our goal to have orals that can match the safety tolerability and efficacy of injectables. I think our oral GLP-1 is our first attempt in this space and has really good prospects for meeting that initial goal. But then noting of course that the injectables are going to get better over time and the orals will catch up as well. The second part of your question was how do the orals catch up. And I think you're sort of alluding to an obvious issue, which is right now our oral GLP-1 and other orals in the space are single mechanism, single incretin agonists. I think, we've seen with great drugs like Trulicity and competitive products what single agonist against GLP-1 can achieve. It's not as good, I think, as what can be achieved with dual agonism for tirzepatide or hopefully even triple agonism with GGG. And so you can bet, we're working on oral solutions that can bring additional incretin activity to patients in a pill. Nothing ready to disclose today but we're working hard. Yes. Sure. As I was just saying I mean obesity is clearly a chronic often lifetime disease. And for such diseases patients often need to take therapy for chronically -- potentially life of the disease here. A lot of times in medicine that doesn't happen of course, people come off of therapies, because either the therapy is working, and they think they don't need anymore or there's a benefit they can't see. I'm not sure either of those are the case for a drug like tirzepatide. People clearly can observe the benefits that the drug is having on their health. And perhaps unfortunately, but not different really than any other drug that we have for any other disease. When you stop taking the drug, it's likely that it can no longer work, and patients may see that as well. So I think those factors will combine to have a pretty long duration of therapy. We have to wait and see in the marketplace maybe Mike has some early signals from patients, but still pretty early on. Anything there, Mike? Yeah. Maybe I'll answer the second part of the question first, which is around, why did the FDA issue the CRL. I think that the FDA regulations actually suggest that FDA should list all deficiencies in the CRL. We were pretty explicit copying some of the FDA's own words here to investors about what was in the CRL. It didn't discuss issues like ARIA it was focused on the 12-month exposure. So nothing further to speculate there. I think your question on rates of ARIA-E and ARIA-H comparing across drugs is a complicated one. We did this head-to-head study against aducanumab. I think it's important to use studies like that to compare rates of ARIA, because we've learned that grades of ARIA are highly dependent on the type of patients who enroll the stage of disease and underlying pathology, baseline characteristics of their brain scans, which are different across lecanemab trials and genetimib trials, as well as exactly how you do the MRIs and read them. So I'm personally not going to get worked up about rates of asymptomatic radiographic-only ARIA in any drug. I don't think anyone really understands what that means. What we should be focused on though is rates of symptomatic ARIA. So patients who have ARIA that turns into something they experience, not just a radiographic binding and particularly rates of serious adverse events resulting ARIA. We know that in some patients ARIA can be dangerous even fatal as we've seen from lecanemab experiences. So that's what we'll be looking out for. I think we still have all the caveats about cross-trial comparisons here, but it's a bit easier to compare those symptomatic or serious events. I think in TRAILBLAZER-1 our numbers were very similar to other members of the class. In TRAILBLAZER-4, the numbers look very, very good for that. And we'll wait and see what we have in TRAILBLAZER-2. The level of concern over that is not high. Okay. I'll start with the LP little a question. We have two LP little a programs, so maybe the easiest one to comment on first is the oral program. This is a first-in-class I think, probably the only one in clinic here. An oral medication against this target is really a huge feat of molecular engineering. I'm super excited to see the data from this molecule developed and obviously, the market opportunity for an oral drug for such a widespread condition is very important. In terms of the siRNA, you're right to note that a competitor is ahead of us and really just starting the CVOT study. It's a long road to get these drugs to market with outcome studies are needed here to show the benefit. I probably don't get into our differentiation strategy. But, of course, we have some ideas here and we'll move as quickly as possible. I don't see this as a winner take all space. Yeah. Thanks. Clearly I think there's a lot we can learn from competitor readouts here. And so looking at lecanemab data in our eyes, I think it actually further validates an endpoint like ADAS. If you just look at the forest bot for example there's a lot more homogeneity in effect on an endpoint like ADAS versus CDR Sum of Boxes. So we feel more confident I would say than ever before that endpoint like that is the right way to go. On the other hand I think the -- you could take the position that since lecanemab hit CDR Sum of Boxes people might say, well then it's achievable and you guys should do it too. So there's some pushes and some takes there. But on the whole still feeling good about ADAS as a primary outcome. When you ask though what happens if you hit one outcome and not the other. That's surely a difficult situation to be in. We want to understand why that happened. If that were to happen where the irregularities in CDR Sum of Boxes that could explain it what did the rest of the secondaries look like. Always best to hit all of your outcomes in a clinical trial. Feeling that you want to hit your primary in as many secondaries as possible. So let's wait and see. Yes. I think ,you've got it basically, right. Remternetug is a new medicine, a new molecule, but it's an antibody against the same type of epitope that donanemab has which is this N3pG form of a beta. So a very equivalent mechanism of action. Maybe a little better potency and certainly better drug properties including, no ADAs and formulation things. So the rationale here is to give improved dosing options to patients. Could we get even faster plaque clearance, could it be with fewer doses, could it be subcutaneous. Those are the types of things, that we're currently exploring. The Phase III is designed with a bit of a run-in, were in that portion right now to finalize our dosing strategy and then expand it. Obviously, if donanemab is disappointing there would be read-through remternetug. On the other hand, if donanemab exceeds expectations, I would expect that to read through as well."

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Well, overall we feel very good with the data we have seen on mirikizumab. If we look at the 52 weeks, we have more than 50% clinical remission and we see statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both clinical, symptomatic, endoscopic and histologic endpoints. What I think is important that if you look at the patient populations with ulcerative colitis, we saw the same results across the bionaive and the bio failure patients. So I think we're extremely well positioned for the launch here. We also demonstrated on a factor but it's extremely important for patients or agency. More than 40% of patients were either completely or almost our urgency at week 52. So therefore, we believe we have a first-in-class asset here that probably initially will be used mainly second line for those that haven't responded appropriately to TNFs and similar. But we believe that long-term, we are positioned for a first-line placement in treatment of ulcerative colitis. And yes, so the outlook for mirikizumab. It's exciting from a competitive landscape perspective, we don't have bad to have data. But if we compare the data we have seen so far, we believe that mirikizumab compares very favorable both versus what's currently in the marketplace as well as what's in the pipeline with other companies across JAK inhibitors S1Ps and other IL-23s as well. So exciting to launch mirikizumab the first half of this year. When it comes to lebri, I think actually, we are uniquely positioned to really upgrade the expected outcomes of patients with atopic dermatitis. We have here an asset that is actually targeting the most relevant cytokine when it comes to treating atopic dermatitis, IL-13 and it does that with a high binding affinity, high potency and a slow off rate. And I think that probably explains the data that we have seen so far. We're extremely pleased with the Phase III data, and we sold more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at Week 16, maintaining that at Week 52, but also very importantly, statistical and clinically meaningful improvements across both each, which is probably the most disturbing factor for patients with atopic dermatitis, sleep and quality of life. And we saw similar results across both the Q2W and Q4W formulation. We actually believe that lebrikizumab has the potential to become a first-line biologic. It's important to have in mind that we announced the submission at the Q3 earnings call, and we expect that traditional regulatory pathway. Yes, we will not launch until most likely Q4 of 2023. But a lot of excitement from both health care providers and tier community as well on the payers to get leverage to the market."

There have been a number of markets in Europe that have taken some austerity measures, partially due to Ukraine crisis and energy crisis and inflation in Europe. We have seen Germany, France, obviously, the UK, voluntary system we think is broken and so we exited that. And so we -- there are some austerity measures in there. We've contemplated that into our guidance for 2023. And the overall impact is modest relative to historical declines in price in prior years. We expect that to continue to be in that mid-single-digit decline in price in Europe."

And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Lois, and good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo@Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Mike Sprengnether, Kento Ueha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team.  During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures.  Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: Well, thanks, Joe. Over the last three months, we continued to successfully execute our strategy. On the commercial front, we drove strong volume-based growth of our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro, which has seen an impressive initial uptick. At the same time, we advanced our late-phase pipeline progressing towards potential launches of 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also investing in our early-stage pipeline and new modalities like gene therapy. To meet the growing demand for our products and prepare for future launches, we have also continued to invest in expansion of our manufacturing footprint.  I'd highlight 2 areas of high unmet need where Lilly is progressing new medicines to improve patient outcomes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. In obesity, we are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, enabling us to potentially bring this promising medicine to patients even sooner. We're also initiating SURMOUNT MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity.  In Alzheimer's disease, our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2study for dunenumab continues to progress towards a top line readout in mid-2023. And we continue to work with the FDA to pursue an accelerated approval based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data. We also announced completion of our submission for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis in both the U.S. and the EU. With already completed submissions for donanemab, pertibrutinib, mirikizumab. We are excited by the potential to launch 4 new medicines between now and the end of 2023. We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of new product launches for Lilly and undoubtedly 1 of the most impressive rates in our industry.  Turning to our strategic deliverables on Slide 4. Q3 revenue grew 7% in constant currency. Worldwide volume grew a robust 14%. Key product growth grew 19% and now account for 70% of our core business revenue, a reflection of the youth and durability of our marketed product portfolio. We're encouraged to see the continued global adoption of products like Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and our anchor [indiscernible] medicines, including Mounjaro and Trulicity.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3, which is in line with the same period last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges.  For pipeline milestones, we shared several important updates since our Q2 earnings call, including FDA Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, with completion of a rolling submission expected by mid-2023; EU and Japan approval for Mounjaro for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; U.S. and EU submission of lebrikizumab for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and FDA accelerated approval for Retevmo in RET fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors regardless of tumor type and traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.  Dan will discuss this in more detail later but we are excited to have announced the acquisition of Akros, which aims to accelerate efforts in gene therapies that promise to restore, improve and preserve hearing for patients living with disabling hearing loss. This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to advancing genetic medicine at Lilly. And finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders.  On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including several important personnel, COVID-19 antibody and ESG updates. We announced the upcoming retirement of Steve Fry, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Diversity, following more than 35 years at our company. I'd like to thank Steve for playing a key role in advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and leading our efforts to be the premier employer in our region and our sector.  We also welcome Eric Dozier, who will succeed Steve. Eric has nearly 25 years of experience at Lilly and a strong track record of developing people and teams that deliver impressive business results. I'm confident he is the right leader to progress our people strategy, which is vital for Lilly to achieve our ambitious growth objectives ahead.  In August, we began to make our COVID-19 antibody beptilizumab available for purchase to states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor. In Q3, we shipped an additional 600,000 -- or 60,000, I should say, doses of beptilizumab to the U.S. government for approximately $110 million. These are to be used for the financially vulnerable patients through a product replacement program. At this time, we are not anticipating any further U.S. government orders for beptilizumab.  With regards to our ESG efforts, we published our inaugural sustainability bond allocation and impact report, highlighting the allocation of approximately EUR 128 million across a range of sustainability projects since the issuance of the sustainability bond in September of '21. For more information about this and the many other aspects of our ESG program, you can visit our Lilly ESG website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Anat for a more detailed review of our Q3 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q3, let me highlight a change in how we expect to communicate our acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. In mid-October, we filed an 8-K with the SEC to provide investors earlier clarity on the impact from acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for Q3. In future quarters, we generally expect to provide this information for quarterly updates on our Investor Relations website.  Now moving to our results. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 and I'll focus my overall comments on non-GAAP performance. A few notable items affected year-over-year comparisons in Q3. Foreign exchange rates had a roughly 430 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as Q3 revenue grew by 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We recognized $86 million of revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan; we experienced the first full quarter impact of Alimta's U.S. Fed expiry; and the increase in sales of COVID-19 antibodies and the decrease in sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 impacted our results.  When excluding revenue from Alimta, which is now off patent across the EU, Japan and the U.S., COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew 9% for the quarter or 14% in constant currency, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year, the impact of lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs were offset by favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Total operating expenses increased 1% this quarter. Growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses were largely offset by lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges that reduced operating expense growth by nearly 350 basis points. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by the increased cost associated with the launch of Mounjaro, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 6%, driven by higher development expense for late-stage assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.  Operating income increased 6% in Q3, primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributable to the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges.  Our Q3 effective tax rate was 10.7%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the favorable tax impact related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased approximately 12% this quarter to $1.98 per share. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charge and a negative impact of $0.06 in Q3 2022 compared to $0.17 in the same period last year.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange movements primarily related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, decreased revenue by 4%.  Moving to our performance by key geography. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% driven by volume growth of 15%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue in the U.S. increased 20% driven primarily by key growth products. U.S. volume growth was partially offset by a net price decline of 4%, driven primarily by lower realized prices for Humalog due to segment mix and the list price reduction for insulin Lispro injection.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio and Taltz. We are encouraged by the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth as the impact from the patent expiry for Alimta, which lost exclusively in June 2021, received from base period comparison.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased by 2% in constant currency. The growth of our newer medicine and revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan was more than offset by the continued impact of declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both face generic entry in June 2021. We expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023 as we continue to scale our key growth products and the impact of patent expiration subsides.  In China, revenue declined 10% in constant currency as we continue to be impacted by the Zero COVID policy measures. We're also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures for Tyvyt from local competitors with NR DLXs. In addition, we experienced the first full quarter of the pricing impact of volume-based procurement for Humalog. As we expect to maintain a high level of access for our innovative portfolio, we believe our volume should accelerate to drive net growth in the future.  Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 6% in constant currency in Q3, primarily driven by customer buying patterns. The year-to-date growth of 8% in constant currency in this region is more representative underlying trends.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust waterwide volume growth. These products drove approximately 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our current performance and future outlook.  Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of a key growth product. This quarter, these brands grew 19% or 25% in constant currency, generated $4.6 billion in sales and made up 70% of our core business revenue. Products like Verzenio, Taltz in dermatology and Jardiance have outpaced competitors growth and are leaders in new-to-brand share of market within their respective classes.  In the injectable incretin market, we continue to see significant opportunity for further class growth. In addition to Mounjaro successful launch in the U.S., Trulicity has continued to experience strong growth globally. To date, our incretin manufacturing production is ahead of our internal plan, and we remain focused on sustaining this performance.  Strong demand for Trulicity, partially due to ongoing limited availability of competitive GLP-1, continues to challenge our ability to meet expanding demand in most international markets. In those situations, we're working hard to supply market demand will minimize an impact to existing patients, including communication in these markets not to initiate new patients on Trulicity. In the U.S., script volume remains robust. And while we build more capacity, wholesalers may experience intermittent restocking delays of Trulicity orders.  Moving to Slide 11. We're pleased with the rapid uptake of Mounjaro in the first 4 months since launch. Approximately 70% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients naive to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class and less than 10% for switches from Trulicity. We are progressing peer negotiations and have more than doubled the level of access to approximately 45% of total commercial and Part D lives. And as we expand access, the proportion of paid script should start to increase.  Our focus is to make Mounjaro available for type 2 diabetes patients, and we intend to take actions designed to ensure access and supply for these patients. These actions may negatively impact prescription volume, but are not expected to impact net revenue. We have seen unprecedented demand for Mounjaro's type 2 diabetes launch in the U.S., bolstered by strong efficacy and a positive customer experience. Availability of competitor's incretin also is a key factor as we assess Mounjaro's demand and supply.  To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have plans to add substantial additional manufacturing capacity. In 2023, we expect the RTP site in North Carolina to become fully operational and that capacity, coupled with additional actions and extensions in other sites, will result in doubling Lilly's incretin manufacturing capacity at the end of 2023.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $6.8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in dividend and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities are to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, bolster manufacturing capacity, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.  Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook now includes an additional $300 million of headwinds from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $1 billion of foreign exchange headwinds of revenue for the full year compared to our original guidance. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged.  Our guidance now includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $670 million, reflecting total charges in the first 9 months of the year. We have not recognized material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges to date in Q4. And this guidance does not include any impact from the potential acquisition -- for business development or acquisition in the remainder of the year, including pending acquisition of [indiscernible]. Our non-GAAP operating margins remain unchanged at approximately 29%.  On a reported basis, operating margin is now expected to be approximately 26%, driven by the intangible asset impairment for our GBA1 Gene Therapy due to change in estimated launch timing. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expensed in the range of $600 million to $700 million, reflecting the net impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during Q3 2022.  Our tax rate and EPS in the first 9 months of the year includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year continues to assume this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for the full year 2022.  Assuming this deferral repeal occurs before the end of the year, we expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which includes the cumulative tax impact of immediately expensing research and development costs for the full year 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repeal effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%.  Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.46 to now be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65 per share and lowered our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.85. The $0.20 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates as well as the $0.06 impact from the incremental acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in Q3.  Now before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as you begin to think about next year. Starting with revenue, we're confident in the growth outlook of our core business. We expect to build on the positive momentum across our pre-growth products, including the continued strong launch of Mounjaro and launches of new products. While we anticipate that initial revenue from our next wave of potential launches will be modest in 2023 with only partial year revenue, we do expect the donanemab, pitubrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab will serve as additional catalysts for continued growth.  In 2023, we will see the full year impact of the Alimta's patent expiry in the U.S., where new generics have eroded Alimta sales starting mid-Q2 and we anticipate a low single-digit headwind from foreign exchange rates. As for revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, we will continue to make bebtelovimab available for purchase. However, the demand for these therapies will depend not only on COVID-19 case counts but also on evolving variants and available therapies. We continue to believe that COVID-19 antibodies will not be a major driver for long-term growth for Lilly.  We will invest in our future as we advance promising R&D opportunities, expand our manufacturing capacity and support the potential launch of multiple new products. Assuming inflation persist, we expect to see that impact in 2023 as well. Also, we will be making a significant investment in one of our most important assets, our talented workforce, through increases in compensation that are partially due to inflation pressures, but also to ensure we have the right capabilities to deliver on the promise of our future growth.  While these investments will slow our operating margin expansion in 2023, they are critical to maximizing pipeline and new launch opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid- to long term. We look forward to sharing more details on our 2023 guidance call on December 13.  Now I'll turn over the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. 2022 has been another outstanding year for R&D at Lilly. In addition to Mounjaro approval, we have now completed regulatory submissions for 4 new medicines that could all launch by the end of 2023: portibrutinib, mirikizumab, lebrikizumab, and denetimab. In addition, we advanced our early-stage pipeline with promising next-generation assets in all of our key areas. Plus we've continued to improve our capabilities and advance our projects in our growing nucleic acid medicine portfolio.  Before I share an R&D update for our core business, let me briefly add to Anat's update on COVID-19 antibodies. While we've made bebtelovimab commercially available, we're also closely watching the emergence of new highly mutated strains. Based on pseudovirus data, we do not believe that bebtelovimab will neutralize against the new BQ variants. However, we do have potentially broadly neutralizing antibodies in our labs that we can consider bringing forward if there is a need and an aligned path forward with health authorities.  Moving to our core R&D portfolio. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover important developments since our last earnings call by therapeutic area.  Starting with diabetes and obesity. We have several updates for tirzepatide. For type 2 diabetes, in addition to the U.S. approval of Mounjaro in Q2, we're pleased to announce recent approvals in the EU and Japan. For chronic weight management, we're pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions that have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.  We plan to initiate a rolling submission this year that will be primarily based on the results from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which is complete; and SURMOUNT-2, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2023. Assuming positive SURMOUNT-2 results, we expect to complete the rolling submission with these data in mid-2023 for potential regulatory action as early as late next year. We're working hard to bring tirzepatide to adults living with obesity as soon as we can.  We also presented the trial design of tirzepatide SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study. SURMOUNT-MMO evaluates treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults living with obesity without diabetes and measures the effects of tirzepatide on a broad set of outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular events. As our primary endpoint, we are measuring the occurrence of a cardiovascular event from a 5-point CV composite that includes all-cause mortality. We've also incorporated key secondary endpoints, including traditional MACE 3 events, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and adverse renal outcomes.  In SURMOUNT-MMO, we are studying both primary and secondary prevention of events in a broader at-risk population more representative of that seen in clinical practice. The SURMOUNT-MMO study has now initiated, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future. SURMOUNT-MMO is just the latest addition to tirzepatide's development plan. where our goal is to not only demonstrate chronic weight management but also to demonstrate improvement across multiple outcomes as a result of weight loss. We're extremely confident in tirzepatide's potential to impact health outcomes of patients living with type 2 diabetes, obesity and other obesity-related metabolic outcomes.  Transitioning to the rest of our diabetes portfolio, we started 2 more Phase III studies for our weekly basal insulin FC and expect to start the fifth and final registration study in the Quint program in the coming months. We also received FDA approval for the Tempo Smart Button and medical device and key component of Lilly's forthcoming Tempo personalized diabetes management platform. We're excited to begin to introduce this platform to the marketplace this year.  Moving to oncology. In line with expectations previously communicated, we've now performed another interim analysis for MONARCH-E, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The results of this analysis will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium next month.  We're excited by what we've seen and we look forward to sharing the data publicly. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in the adjuvant setting, and we are enthusiastic about Verzenio's ability to substantially reduce the risk of developing incurable life-threatening metastatic disease.  We also announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Retevmo for pretreated adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion regardless of tumor type. And also granted traditional approval for Retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a RET gene fusion as detected by an FDA-approved test. We're grateful to have the opportunity to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to more patients across more tumor types with Retevmo.  We also began dosing patients in our fifth Phase III study for pirtobrutinib. This latest trial is a head-to-head study evaluating pirtobrutinib against ibrutinib in BTK inhibitor-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As a reminder, pirtobrutinib is currently under priority review at the FDA and for mantle cell lymphoma previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with regulatory action expected in early 2023. We also continue to have discussions with the FDA about potentially accelerating the approval pathway for CLL in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.  Switching to immunology. We presented detailed week 52 results from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy studies in patients with moderate to spare atopic dermatitis at 2 recent dermatology conferences. The maintenance data showed that lebrikizumab provided robust and durable skin clearance with improvements in itch, sleep and quality of life amongst patients who achieved a clinical response in the 16-week induction period.  Notably, the results also suggested that less frequent dosing of lebrikizumab can provide similar improvements to once every 2-week dosing. Based upon the data we've collected across our trials in over 2,000 patients, we believe lebrikizumab could become a first-line biologic for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a disease where there's significant need to provide new options for a large and diverse patient population.  As part of our efforts to reach a diverse patient population, we've recently initiated an innovative clinical trial to evaluate lebrikizumab for people with skin of color who have a disproportionately higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and often struggle with more severe forms of the disease. We have now submitted a BLA to the FDA. And Almirall, who holds rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for dermatologic indications in Europe, has submitted to the EMA for authorization. We expect regulatory decisions in both the U.S. and the EU by the end of next year. Together with Almirall, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.  Shifting to our efforts in genetic medicines. You'll see that we have now advanced our ANGPTL3 siRNA to Phase II development in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is our first siRNA asset to advance to Phase II. And with this molecule, alongside our Lp(a) siRNA, where we shared proof-of-concept data last year, we're optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes using our portfolio of genetic medicines.  Within gene therapy, we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with fatal neurodegenerative diseases, where we're advancing our Prevail Therapeutics programs. We particularly look forward to sharing biomarker results from our progranulin gene therapy program at an upcoming scientific meeting for frontal temporal dementia.  Building on our gene therapy experience with Prevail, we're thrilled to welcome Akouos and their talented team who will bring a transformational gene therapy approach to treating genetically defined hearing loss. Hearing loss is an area of severe unmet need that historically has not been a focus of pharmacologic development. And we believe treatment of sensory neuronal hearing loss through gene therapy delivered to the inner ear is an area ripe for technologic advances for the benefit of patients.  Finally, let me turn to Alzheimer's disease, where there have been a number of important developments since our last call. As a company dedicated to the fight against Alzheimer's, we were pleased to see the positive top line Phase III results for lecanemab. Following dunetimab's TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, this lecanumab study may further support the benefit of removing amyloid plaques for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  These data certainly reinforce our confidence in donanemab and the forthcoming readout from our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, which is expected by the middle of 2023, and which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. In the meantime, we continue working with the FDA to seek accelerated approval in early '23 and based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data.  The availability of and access to safe and effective therapies is important to slow the devastating impact on the estimated 6.5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide living with this disease and their loved ones. While we acknowledge the hard work ahead to bring these therapies to patients in need, we are excited and we are confident in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio and the potential impact our drugs can have on patients.  Accordingly, we initiated TRAILRUNNER-ALZ, the first trial in our Phase III program for Remternetug, our next-generation anti-amyloid antibody. Remternetug has demonstrated deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance and provides the opportunity to explore flexible dosing regimens for patients.  Finally, in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head trial comparing donanemab to aducanumab on amyloid plaque lowering in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have now achieved positive results on the co-primary endpoints of amyloid lowering as expected with a consistent safety profile to previous donanemab studies. For this study, the incidence of ARIA-E in the donanemab group was 21.1%, with 2.8% of donanemab-treated patients showing symptomatic ARIA-E, suggesting the potential that rates of plaque clearance are not directly linked to rates of ARIA development. We'll share the detailed results at the upcoming CTAD meeting in late November, including the relationship between the degree of amyloid plaque removal and plasma phospo tau, as well as radiographic area.  While we focus most of our markets today on late-stage assets, you also notice we have a number of developments across our early-stage portfolio as shown on the slides. Across the pipeline, Q3 was another productive quarter at Lilly.  Now I turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We continue to grow our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro's strong U.S. launch. At the same time, we continue to advance our pipeline, progressing towards potential launches for 4 new medicines by the end of next year, while also internally and externally investing in our early-stage pipeline and discovery capabilities. With the progress we've made, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.  Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask you please limit your questions to 2 per caller. Lois, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: I just had two here on Mounjaro. I guess the first is just on gross to net trends we should be thinking about from here. I think you're talking at this point about 45% access. Can you talk about just where that will be trending as we look out into maybe early 2023 and when do you think you'll be at a point where the drug will have similar access to what we see with Trulicity currently?  And then my second question in Mounjaro was on manufacturing capacity given what's been really an exceptional launch so far. It sounds like you're in a position to double capacity by end of '23. I guess the kind of bigger picture question I'm asking is, do you see any capacity issues that could limit uptake at all of Mounjaro as we look between now and when that additional facility comes online?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Chris. I think maybe I'll go to Mike for both the first question on gross to net trends and access and for some commentary on manufacturing capacity. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Okay. Thanks, Chris, for the questions. I appreciate that. As we guided before launch, we recommended that you look at more revenue. It was a better indicator of our performance than net revenue. We took 2 decisions that were really focused on looking at generating long-term value for Mounjaro. First, we decided to put in place a bridging program that would bridge people who have type 2 diabetes with a low out-of-pocket cost of $25 until they achieved formulary access on their insurance. We were confident that we were going to build, and we still are confident that we're going to build good broad access for Mounjaro.  But we wanted to make sure that we had a bridging program in that then allowed us to be disciplined and patient as we gained access. We wanted to make sure that we look for the long term, not the short term. If you're too short term-focused, then you're going to be driven to gain access quickly and not make the right pricing decisions. So we thought the bridging program tied with the disciplined negotiation approach was the best approach. And that's the one we've taken and that's the 1 we've held true to during our launch.  So what we'll see is net price will increase as we gain payer access. In the third quarter, we had 22% of people with commercial and Part D insurance had formerly access Mounjaro. As of October 1, that jumped to 45%. And what we anticipate is we'll still take a disciplined moderated approach to make sure we get the best access for the right price point. And we're still very confident that we will grow and we'll achieve broad access in the upcoming future.  We are also adjusting our bridging program to further ensure that it's utilized for people with type 2 diabetes, which will impact new start volume but should impact net revenue. So we expect over the upcoming quarters that net price will grow for Mounjaro. As it comes to supply, our supply chain has performed exceptionally well since launch. We're taking actions to maximize production supply for our current facilities while we ramp up our new manufacturing facilities that you referenced.  The U.S. Mounjaro launch is really unprecedented with a viral nature given just tremendous patient satisfaction and the visible results that people experience that really spark many conversations with them, the type 2 diabetes community, which then brings greater interest in the type 2 diabetes committee, our community for Mounjaro. But it is a dynamic situation, given the uncertainty of competitor GLP supply and that Mounjaro patient prescription abandonment long-term adherence and dose titration rates have it yet with steady-state, which are all important forecasting assumptions.  So given the dynamic nature of this, it's reasonable to assume that weekly production forecast won't perfectly aligned with weekly demand each week. So this will produce some intermittent delays in meeting wholesale orders for some dosing strengths as we ramp up our supply chain. If this happens, our teams will work hard to avoid or minimize any short-term impact for people that with type 2 diabetes. But stepping back and taking a look at the longer-term picture, we're in a great position.  Mounjaro's launch is going extremely well because patient experiences have been tremendous, and they have a high interest in the product profile. We expect Mounjaro's launch has fueled significant increment market growth which I think just gives us more confidence in the future. And we had the foresight to initiate significant manufacturing capacity expansion before Mounjaro launch because we saw the potential of the product. So we're in a very good long-term position with Mounjaro.\nOperator: The next question is from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: Maybe two follow-ups for me. So just on the manufacturing side. I mean, is that kind of supply challenges you're going to run into kind of expected through the first half of the year? I'm just wondering if there's any way you can bring North Carolina on board any sooner. I know you've got it to year-end, but just maybe help us think about anything you can do to kind of bring that online sooner. And then the bridging program, Mike, you mentioned you made some changes there. So the percentage of patients not with type 2 diabetes will may be different on the forward. Can you tell us what that represents currently and how we should think about that change to volume on the forward?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Terence. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes, all manufacturing supply, I'll reinforce that our main manufacturing supply and teammates have delivered exceptional results, and they continue to look for every way to maximize our production supply. They have all hands on deck to get the Research Triangle Park facility online as soon as possible. And as soon as that facility is available, we'll make good use of that supply.  So we're confident in our ability for our manufacturing personnel and our leadership there. And as I said before, we're very confident in the long-term potential of tirzepatide. With the bridging program, I think your question was more around kind of off-label use of Mounjaro and how much it was.  As you know, Mounjaro was approved in the U.S. for patients with type 2 diabetes, and we have just excellent processes in place to ensure that all promotional activities are in line with our approved label. We're pleased with our disciplined on-label promotional execution. The launch of Mounjaro has been very disciplined and in line with everything that we wanted. So we've been encouraged by both patients and physicians prescribing experiences, and this has driven a very high interest in Mounjaro.  We haven't -- we don't have perfect data to suggest what diagnosis a patient has. The best data that we have is to look at the -- whether those individuals who are starting Mounjaro, whether they have previously been on a diabetes medication or not. Given that our promotion is focused solely on type 2 diabetes, we would expect to see the majority of people use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, and that's what we've seen.  While we see fluctuation from week to week in the third quarter, we saw about 2/3 of new patients starting Mounjaro with a history of type 2 diabetes medications. For the remaining 1/3 of patients who are classified as naive to treatment -- diabetes treatments, these individuals could either be newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients or individuals who haven't yet been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\nOperator: The next question is from Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: Maybe a quick one -- a quick couple of questions on Mounjaro. A, if you could speak to the inventory contribution to the third quarter U.S. sales. And B, I was just trying to compare Mounjaro gross to net and the dollars per Rx early into the launch and compared versus how TRULICITY did early into the launch. And I think what stands out is the revenues per Rx were several higher for Trulicity. Perhaps if you could speak to any specific differences in the type and extent of patient support. You did early Trulicity launch versus what you're doing in Mounjaro.Clearly, the volumes have majorly, majorly surpass what Trulicity did early on.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Umer. So Mike, go back to you on both questions. First one on inventory contribution to Q2 sales, and then the second on the gross to net and how that would compare versus what we saw with Trulicity.\nMichael Mason: Okay. Good question. Inventory contributions to Q3 sales was 40%. But I also note that as soon as a product shifts our product, we accrue for rebates and discounts whether that product is used to supply patient demand in the pharmacy or whether that's used in the channel for inventory. As it comes to gross to net, the big change is, if you look at the Trulicity launch versus the Mounjaro launch is we did not have a bridging program at the launch of Trulicity like we do for Mounjaro.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nStephen Scala: Why does Lilly think FDA is requiring it to submit results from SURMOUNT-2 for the tirzepatide obesity filing when that study would not seem particularly relevant given that it is in diabetics does not select for obesity and is smaller than SURMOUNT-1? And given that the FDA request seems of tenuous value, could it be relaxed perhaps on an interim look at SURMOUNT-2? So that's the first question.  Second, why did Lilly sell co-promotion rights to Mounjaro in Japan when it is, I believe, Lilly's second largest market. Lilly has a large footprint there, presumably Mounjaro is a critical long-term driver to Lilly and do so for only $86 million. Granted Lilly has done this before, such as selling rights to Cialis in China, but that was at one -- at a point when Cialis was in steep decline, whereas Mounjaro is your future?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Steve. So first for the question about the FDA and submission for tirzepatide for obesity, we'll go to Dan. And then your second question around the collaboration agreement in Japan, we'll go to Ilya. So Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question on SURMOUNT-2 here in FDA requirements. Maybe I'll just start off by relieving any worries that there's any specific concerns with the data or safety or anything like that. We don't see anything such as that driving FDA concerns. I think the FDA discussion around having 2 trials is just to be consistent with FDA guidance for adequate and well-controlled studies in chronic weight management that for that indication, having multiple studies in a population with obesity with primary endpoints defined as per the guidance on thresholds of weight loss is the requirement. And that's the requirement of being held to have 2 studies.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Ilya, do you want to take the question around the Japan tirzepatide?\nIlya Yuffa: Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. You're right, japan is a critical market. Just to clarify, the $86 million that we recognized for revenue and payment from Mitsubishi Tanabe was for an upfront payment for collaboration which is consistent with partnerships we've had in Japan for a number of our growth brands. Like Trulicity, like Emgality, we've had success in having strategic partnerships with local Japanese companies to successfully commercialize our innovative treatments. We believe that this partnership will allow us to maximize the value of tirzepatide in Japan and Mitsubishi Tanabe does have significant scale and experience in diabetes. And together, we will collaborate. And just to clarify, we will preserve the economics on ongoing economics for the launch and sales of Mounjaro in Japan for [indiscernible].\nOperator: The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Thanks for the question. Mike, you mentioned a low switch rate to Mounjaro from Trulicity, but what was the driver of sequential trends for Trulicity? And maybe how do you see cannibalization playing out in the next few years? And then the second question for Dan, on tirzepatide and obesity, you guys added the MMO study, but there are a lot of other additional indications beyond what you guys have talked about where obesity plays a role like a few coronary syndromes or other broad cardio indications come to mind. So how do you guys plan on prioritizing the clinical investments from here for tirzepatide, like what's the math that goes into that?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Geoff. So Mike, we'll go to you for the question around sequential trends and what we expect -- might expect in terms of ongoing switch rates, and then Dan, we'll go to you for prioritization of tirzepatide development plans. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes. What you typically see is actually the switching for a new product into our incretin class is typically the switch rates people switching from another incretin to the launch incretin, those rates will actually go down over time. And so that's what I would anticipate. The real opportunity here is to grow the market and make sure that before being proactive to treat type 2 diabetes.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Mike. Okay, Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Geoff, thanks for the question on future indications for tirzepatide. There are many that we can consider. As you point out, weight loss and restoration of sort of normal metabolism, which we think may be possible with tirzepatide is going to have benefits in a lot of metabolic- and obesity-related diseases. So how do we pick which ones to pursue and when.  I think initially, our thinking has been around generating a body of data that shows that a drug such as tirzepatide when driving weight loss lead to downstream health benefits. So that's what drives the MMO study. We have a heart failure study, a sleep apnea study that are all ongoing. When we think about adding more, sort of where can we see improvements in that medical understanding of the dangers of obesity and the benefits of weight loss and restoration of normal metabolism.  That's how we think about it rather than how big is this patient segment or how big is the next patient segment, noting that almost all of those patient segments will already have obesity as an underlying disease, which we expect to have indicated next year, as I commented earlier. Finally, I think one more consideration here, Geoff, for us is we see fighting obesity as a long-term goal for loan company. And so there'll be multiple generations of drugs here, we hope. And we'll have lots of opportunities to contribute to our medical understanding of weight loss.\nOperator: The next question is from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: So maybe one question on Mounjaro growth in obesity. So when you talk about 100 million patient population, which are obese, not diabetic. I see you're talking about primary prevention. But if you look at the current trials, they are more of secondary prevention type of setting. So how -- the question is how important is getting a primary prevention trial done to get to the broadest patient population in obesity market are possible at this point?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Mohit, for the question. You were a little bit echoey there. I think we got the gist around the patient population for obesity and how to maximize that opportunity. Mike, do you want to take that?\nMichael Mason: Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. Actually, with obesity, it's actually kind of counter to what typically happens to the product. Typically, you get it out, it has a finite patient segmentation, you try to explain that with additional indications. Actually, with obesity, you're going to have the broadest indication for people who either have a BMI of 27 with a risk factor or a BMI over 30, which is a massive population in the U.S. and globally.  And so the additions of our trials aren't necessarily to expand the patient population, but is to demonstrate that proactively treating obesity will improve health outcomes in order to drive physicians to write and payers to give access for the product.\nOperator: Next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: So a couple of quick ones. So with regard to the North Carolina facility, expanding manufacturing capacity, in terms of API versus the actual pens and fill-finish manufacturing, can you just update us on what really is the potential expansion of manufacturing there? It's my understanding that the potential bottleneck is going to be more related to the pen manufacturing.  And it's my understanding also that this is largely the Trulicity pen and the Trulicity pen is going to be the main manufacturing point for pretty much all of your biologic capacity as well as for Trulicity. So just trying to get a better understanding of that. And then second, just on the insulin. There are a number of questions around the change to the penny rule and how Lilly and competitor, Novo, are going to manage through that as many of the insulins could actually be sort of paying the Medicaid fees for the benefit of actually providing insulins. So just trying to get a better understanding of how Lilly hopes to manage that outcome, in particular, it seems wildly unfair to the industry.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Seamus. So I think for the first question on the kind of North Carolina manufacture facility dynamics, I'll hand over to Dave. I mean, David, if you want to comment also on the insulin, I think he's referring to the MCAP dynamics.\nDavid Ricks: I can. And Mike, jump in if I get that wrong. So just to step back on capacity, we did make some comments today related to this. And we've taken actions in the quarter to slow demand internationally on Trulicity, primarily because of the constraints by a competitor, which have shifted demand to Trulicity internationally. Should that happen domestically, of course, that will -- I think we're just trying to give a fair balance to say that, that would be an increase in demand we'd have to manage too as well.  But we are producing above our plans right now. We see that continuing. And the next step-up, Seamus, that we expect in capacity will be North Carolina, which will happen towards the end of next year. Just for clarity, there's actually 2 sites in North Carolina. One we announced in 2020 and one more recently down the road in Concur near Charlotte. That second facility will also come online beginning in '24 with some capacity and really '25 more fully. So the company has taken some pretty aggressive investment steps, and those steps in North Carolina are focused on what we'll call the parental filling and the drug finishing process which is the device that is used for Trulicity, but also Mounjaro.  We take a platform approach. So that device is also used for other Lilly biologics. And gives us flexibility to match supply and demand more agilely. Although Mike's comments were well placed earlier that it's not perfect, like inside of 90 days, we can't perfectly match every skew of demand to every SKU produced. But it does give us a lot of agility. Those 2 sites in North Carolina, I'll point out, I think as Anat said, are huge.  So the first one will literally double our global capacity when it's online, and the second side is a similar size. So we've taken some big CapEx decisions, and it looks well placed given the early uptick in Mounjaro, which looks quite substantial. Those do not speak to the API side. API is a different supply chain. We've also taken actions to expand that capacity. It's currently not the bottleneck and is not expected to be the bottleneck, which is the peptide synthesis process we use.  Of course, big caveat around all this is, of course, things can go wrong. Regulatory approvals are required to bring the new sites online in an on-time fashion, but that's our current outlook. And as Mike said, long term, we're extremely confident we can supply a massive volume of Trulicity and Mounjaro. But these step-ups do take a little bit of time. And should we have a lapse in competitor supply, that will challenge our ability to meet demand. I think that's the main message from today.  As it relates to MCAP, you're right, that beginning in January of '24, for the cap on payments or rebates to Medicaid programs for medications that have a CPI penalty that pushes them above 100% rebate will be lifted, and we will be required to pay states to use our product in that situation. We have not announced our plans to deal with that, although we're formulating plans to deal with that.  And of course, the best thing to do is keep inventing new things, which reset that calculation. And as you know, we've got a Phase III program for weekly insulin and we're progressing efforts on glucose-sensing insulin. We've got, I think, an exciting new approval on Connected Care as well. So all those efforts, I think, are the long-term approach tactically we'll manage through that event at the end of '23, early '24.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Two questions. One on the obesity opportunity for tirzepatide and the regulatory requirements there. SURMOUNT-3 and 4, I believe, are expected to complete also in the first half of next year. Should we be clear in terms of not anticipating that data from those studies are required or that you'll be planning to submit those to the FDA? And if you were to, would that have any potential implications on the time line for potential approval and processing?  Second, you highlighted some data on Verzenio that we're going to see at SABCS. Can you just maybe contextualize for us what you believe might be the potential impact in terms of the adjuvant metastatic split? And anything in terms of how that might influence the trajectory of Verzenio from a revenue standpoint once we see that data?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Chris. Okay. For the first question on tirzepatide obesity and the regulatory requirements around 3 and 4, we'll go to Dan, and then we'll go to Jake for the Verzenio San Antonio Breast Conference, maybe preview.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Chris, our understanding is that we'll submit based on SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2, as we said, and we don't anticipate needing SURMOUNT-3 and 4 for that submission. So no implications to time line from those study readouts.\nDavid Ricks: Jake, do you want to jump in on Verzenio?\nJake Van Naarden: Yes, sure. So as Dan mentioned in the prepared remarks, we conducted a preplanned interim analysis of Monarch as we had talked about earlier in the year that we were going to do that. So of course, we looked at all of the endpoints, IDFS, DRFS and overall survival. We'll be presenting those at San Antonio. Really pleased with what we've seen across the study in both the ITT population cohort 1 as well as the currently labeled indication.  I think there's two components to think about here. One is, how do the data continue to evolve with increased follow-up? And the second is, how does the new analysis look as it relates to potentially expanding our labeled indication over time. And obviously, I want to be careful about reviewing the data themselves, but I think those are the 2 questions that you ought to think about as you see the data in December.\nOperator: Next question is from Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: Congrats on the quarter. Two from my side, first on obesity. There's been quite a bit of discussion around Amgen's upcoming Phase III data. And so could you give us your thoughts on GIP agonism versus antagonism? And just on your development side, could you just remind us when we get updates on GGG and mascutide? And then on the Alzheimer's side, I'm just wondering on donanemab, was any part of your decision to pursue a discrete dosing strategy with regards to stopping when you achieve amyloid negativity? Was any part of that related to antidrug antibodies? I'm just thinking about this, given there's some data suggesting redosing or maintenance dosing may actually be beneficial.\nJoe Fletcher: We'll go to Dan on both questions. First one around obesity, Amgen's data and then the second one around Alzheimer's and discrete dosing related to antidrug antibodies.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Starting with how we think about obesity and in general as much as possible here, our strategy has been to mimic the body's own response to food. So incretins are hormone submitted by -- secreted rather by your gastrointestinal tract in response to eating then lead to satiety and increased calorie expenditure and decreased food intake. That's how they work and GID is one of the major incretins.  So it made sense to pursue a strategy of agonism of that hormone and probably we'll wait and see Amgen's data to understand if antagonism could also have a surprising effect different than the biological effect of acreages normally in humans. With respect to GGG and, I think BCG is our next-generation incretin that's further ahead in development. We've previously communicated that we expect to have internal Phase II data yet this year and use that data to make a decision whether this proceeds to Phase III or not. In which case, we might wait for mastatide data.  That thinking is still consistent and on track for yet this year. The second line of question here was around donanemab discrete dosing strategy, and you're referring here to the notion that we pioneered that once plaques are clear, you can stop taking a plaque-clearing antibody. That was based on our understanding of the biology, nothing to do with antidrug antibodies.  But certainly, we see it as a benefit for patients to not have to continue to take a drug in the absence of having the target or the disease in their brain that's still ongoing. It's pretty specific idea to donanemab, Remternetug and antibodies that are specific to plaques because once the plaques are gone, they're something for the antibodies to do. Our own data that we've shared show that there is no reversion really of adverse biomarkers in patients who've come off therapy. So so far, the data that we have in hand, though it's still early, supports cessation of dosing as appropriate. We'll look to TRAILBLAZER-2 to confirm that hypothesis.\nOperator: The next question is from David Risinger from SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger: I guess first, although there was 22% coverage in the U.S. in the third quarter, that didn't fully translate into net revenue. So could you provide some more color on why that was the case? Was it because formulary access at the national level may not immediately translate to paid Rx for certain downstream customers of payers because additional negotiations may be required, I thought that might be a factor and this will help us better understand how to think about the 45% coverage that you have as of October 1.  And then second, with respect to ex U.S. sales prospects, I'm not sure if you provided this yet, but could you talk about how we should think about sales to Mitsubishi in the fourth quarter sequentially? And how we should think about ex U.S. rollout plans in the context of the risk of demand outstripping manufacturing capacity. And one other, just a quick one, just to tie to the first question about the U.S. sales. There was a comment about 40% of the sales being from stocking, but it wasn't clear if that was a U.S. comment. So if you could just clarify that when you address the first question.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave, for the question. So for the first one, we'll go to Mike to discuss a bit about coverage. And I think maybe what you're getting at is around the co-pay card. And then for the second one, we'll go to Ilya to talk about OUS sales prospects and dynamics and timing. So Mike?\nMichael Mason: Okay. Thanks, David, for the question. Yes, the percent that was comp from channel was in a U.S. figure. On the -- when you look at our data and you look at percent covered scripts that were paid versus paid through the savings card, that rate in -- since launch has closely matched our access rates. So I would say that's the best indicator for kind of the percent that are paid versus going through the bridging program.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Ilya, on OUS?\nIlya Yuffa: Yes. Maybe first on Mitsubishi Tanabe and the dynamics of the upfront payment. Basically, the economics are the upfront payment and the future economics would be when we actually start commercializing and selling Mounjaro in Japan market. So that is a onetime upfront payment. And so that's how I would look at the economics for the future. In terms of overall commercialization of Mounjaro outside of the U.S., I think one of the aspects that's important for us to determine is ensuring that whenever we enter a market that we can ensure that we can appropriately supply Mounjaro to type 2 patients in any given market.  And we will evaluate that as well as build up our access. As you may know, for most markets outside the U.S., it takes time and there's typically a lag between approval and also gaining access to patients for reimbursement. And so we don't anticipate that being a significant delay in the full commercialization of Mounjaro outside the U.S., but of course, we will look and monitor and ensure that we have adequate supply when we enter a market.\nOperator: The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So first question I had for you is, how you see the market for all GLP-1s and injectables playing out over time? And then the second question I had for you is, do you think a positive outcome in Novo SELECT study will be enough to convince payers of the opportunity here? Or do you think they'll have to look for a broader study like your MMO? And I don't know if you said this before or not, but will you have an interim look in your SURMOUNT-MMO data?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Louise. Mike, let you kind of handle both. First one is around what we see for the market for oral glips and then around prospects for positive SELECT study.\nMichael Mason: Okay. On the oral GLP market, I mean, in our market research, consumers are very interested in oral products, both in type 2 diabetes and obesity. And so the prospects of an oral anti-obesity product is very attractive. So we're very encouraged by that opportunity and are excited by our NPA program. As it comes to the positive CV study, if Novo is able to get that with semaglutide, to me, it's -- it's more of an opportunity to show the benefits of the products in the class.  I think any additional benefits that are represented by whether it be our trials or Novo trials are going to help the class and help more payers and more health care professionals take action on the product. And so I think their trial will provide good information and good data for health care professionals and payers. And while our trial is a little bit different, and we think is a little bit broader in nature, we think that will also expand it.  So to me, it's not a comparing our study, the SURMOUNT-MMO study versus SELECT, it's more new information is going to be good for the class, good for health care professionals. We really should be treating obesity a lot more proactive than what we do today. And I think those trials will show the need for that.\nDavid Ricks: Maybe if I could jump on this one because I'm speaking to a lot of analysts, there's a desire to anchor on one event that will then trigger broad commercial access for obesity or not. And I don't really think we think it's going to play out that way that already, there are commercial payers who reimburse medicines for chronic weight management and obesity. It's a small number.  We think as the data accumulates over the course of the balance of the decade that, that will become the norm just like we expect in hypertensive to be paid for. Of course, the big action might relate to Troa and the government coverage in the U.S. or similar efforts ex U.S. And those will be more binary. But I wouldn't encourage investors to think about this sort of waiting for one definitive data set, but rather a more accumulating effect over time where commercial access will slowly open up over the next many years due to both Lilly's efforts and other's efforts to prove the health benefits of chronic weight management.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions, please. First, on Remternetug, on the time lines on clinic trials, potentially this drug could be launched as early as '25 under accelerated approval 1 year or so post the introduction of Roche subcutaneous. Do you expect the evolving Abeta data to result in removing of the existing NCD in order to allow it to compete effectively? That's the first question. Obviously, at that point, you will only have the Abeta-lowering data, but it will be subcutaneous potentially?  And then second question, just going back to your oral GLP-1 agents, you're about to unblind both diabetes and obesity Phase II trials. Could you talk to how you look at the commercial potential for this market? It strikes me that the DPP4 market is worth about $13 billion, and that's on top of whatever [indiscernible] is doing. So once you solve or if you managed to solve the drug interaction, is there no possibility that this could be a very major contributor to your revenue growth independent to Mounjaro going forward?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Andrew, for the question. So for the first one on Remternetug and the time lines, maybe hand to Anne to chime in as well as the NCD removal dynamics. And then for the second one on the commercial potential for oral Glips, we'll go back to Mike.\nAnne White: Thanks so much for the question on Remternetug. Obviously, we're excited that we've initiated the Phase III program. And as you noted, we've started the first study, which is to assess amyloid lowering. We have a broader Phase III program that we're initiating as well, looking at the clinical endpoints as we've done for donanemab, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far with Remternetug, which was the next generation.  And so you're going to see us continue to invest in the AD platform going forward based on donanemab's compelling data and then where we're seeing early, it was on Remternetug. And as you said, it offers the convenience of an additional dosing form that we think will offer a lot of convenience to patients. On your question around the NCD, obviously, we hope now that CMS, we now have the Phase II data from donanemab, which clearly showed clinical benefit as well as clearance of plaque. Now we have the lucanumab data, a large Phase III study also showing clinical benefit. Certainly, it's our position that this is time for CMS to reconsider this decision.  So certainly, we would hope that this is resolved before Remternetug reads out. Obviously, the time line though, is not clear. So what you'll see us do, and I'm sure is doing the same as soon as we have that Phase III data requesting reconsideration and moving forward with the evidence that's demonstrated today, we cannot see a reason that CMS will continue to prevent Alzheimer's patients from getting these medicines.  And as we've said in the past, we believe CD really is very restrictive method to provide to the patients who have this disease and also leads to disparity we've seen in care for Alzheimer's disease. So certainly, I hope that this will be resolved by the time we have Remternetug available to patients.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks. Mike, anything to add in terms of the oral GLP commercial opportunity?\nMichael Mason: Andrew, I think you're thinking about it correctly. When Rybelsus launched, we expected it to grow the class, not impact the injectable market, and that's exactly what happened. It was more additive to the class. And then as Mounjaro is launched, we only see 1% of Mounjaro's demand coming from Rybelsus or oral GLP. So I think you're right. I think it is additive versus attractive, and we're very pleased with the opportunity.  I think in the oral market, what's going to be key is Rybelsus has some interactions with water and food, which have some dosing limitations, which can impact the efficacy of the product, if it's not followed closely as well as there's a gap between the efficacy of oral Rybelsus and injectables. So I think as you get alternatives in place that doesn't have that food and water interaction as the efficacy of the orals increase, you'll see the market potential even being higher, and that's exactly what we plan to deliver, hopefully, with NPA.\nOperator: The next question is from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman: One on Mounjaro Manzaro, it seems like it's Mounjaro call. Looking at the OUTCOME trial, can you comment on kind of the relative risk reduction you'd like to see in the primary endpoint? If you can't comment on any of the [indiscernible] plan, talk more about the need for outcomes to gain payer access over time? And my second question is on Clarity ID, and I appreciate your positive comments around the trial. But do you believe the bar for efficacy has been raised with these data? And can you just remind us why you believe that your endpoint will be sufficient for full FDA approval and any potential coverage by CMS and other payers?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan. So for the first question on Mounjaro, the kind of outcomes trial and what we need for payer access, I'll hand that over to Mike. And then for the Clarity AD, I'll hand over to Anne.\nMichael Mason: Okay. Maybe I'll take another shot at obesity access and how we see it develop over time. I think Dave talked about back if it's going to take a steady drumbeat of evidence and every payer, every employer will make the decision independently and that will grow over time. The other approach that we're taking is we're studying our tirzepatide for other indications for people who live with obesity like heart failure and sleep apnea.  These are indications that are already supported by commercial and Medicare Part D. And so we believe that as we get access and demonstrate efficacy there and get indications that, that in itself will unlock subsets of payer access for people who live with obesity who have sleep apnea or heart failure as we continue to build toward our -- the results of the MMO study. So I think it will grow over time, but I think those 2 events are important events in the life cycle of tirzepatide.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Anne?\nAnne White: Well, thanks for the question on the Clarity AD and maybe getting to your question, we absolutely see the data that we saw there is clinically meaningful. And clearly, patients, families, care partners highly value a delay in loss of independent stabilities. And so a 20% to 30% slowing of the disease initiated in the earliest stage of the disease should mean additional time in the more functional less impaired stages. So we're excited about those results, and we do think that they're clinically meaningful in this space.  And so we look forward, as we've said, to what we'll see with donanemab. There are many reasons that we're extremely confident about donanemab and those haven't changed. So obviously, it's a positive Phase II study that we were able to produce the choice of the endpoint that we have in our study, as you commented, patient selection strategy and then importantly, the speed and the depth of plaque clearance. So we remain very confident in what we'll see out of our upcoming readout on TD 2.  And then your question on, I think that just as we've said in the past, we believe that is the most robust endpoint in this space. And we've always believed that can be a bit of a noisy endpoint, and so indexing on exact numbers is probably not the best move there. But on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we powered it for Idris. We showed a 32% slowing, which we definitely see as clinically meaningful. And we believe that Idris will always perform closest to the truth. But in a large enough study, we expect all the endpoints will move similarly. So we continue to be confident about the choice of the Idris. We continue to be confident about the TP2 readout that we'll see in mid-2023.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson: If I could just stand Alzheimer's for a minute. Just your latest views on the next big readout here coming up, which is the Roche data. To put it bluntly, do you expect that this readout is going to fail even downstream of lucanumab? It seems to me like you guys are still cautious on that data, what's your latest thinking? Second question, not mentioned pushes and pulls in 2023 and something about donanemab. My question is, are you expecting donanemab approval in 2023? And then third question, just your views of the ARIA-E data can and whether you think that's important and clinically differentiating because that does seem to be a real issue that KOLs talk about a lot, and they have the best data so far.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim. And you got an extra question in there out of the 2. But we'll go to Anne maybe to comment high level on Roche and then also on the pushes pulls for donanemab expectations for timing and then finally, lacanumab differentiation. Maybe on the Roche, maybe Dan give your thoughts first.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Okay. Yes. And then I'll -- I think your last question there, Tim, was on ARIA rates, which I'll maybe take as well. So again, I think I've said before, there's a number of factors here that can help us in predicting results of amyloid lowering drugs. Probably the most important one in our view is the degree of amyloid lowering and there, we're really pleased with what we've seen with donanemab. But lecanumab is probably also a pretty powerful amyloid-lowering drug.  Certainly a positive readout from a Phase III of one of these 3 drugs has got to increase your odds of success of 1 of -- or both of the other 2. But I just sort of remind us all that Alzheimer's has been a risky area with studies that are sometimes hard to predict. So we take some caution. Of course, we'd love to see more positive studies and more news for patients -- good news for patients.  I think before I turn it over to Anne for the other question, I just sort of take ARIA-E and lecanemab data. I think it's a little bit hard to do cross-trial comparisons of rates for a couple of reasons that I think are important, maybe we can talk more about at our scientific presentation at CTAD. Just sort of noting that TRAILBLAZER is probably the first time anyone's ever done within trial comparison of 2 different drugs to be able to compare ARIA.  Why is that important? When you're looking at 2 different trials, first of all, you have different patient populations. I think we'll probably learn over time that ARIA rates depend on the stage of disease and are more common in patients with more severe brain pathology. I think that's likely to be true. Second, even in the same population, how you measure ARIA can be very different in different trials, for example. Lecanemab has different timings of MRI than donanemab has used if you have more MRIs or earlier MRIs as we do, I think.  You're more likely to pick up more radiographic ARIA. So that's another caution on cross-trial comparisons. However, I do see ARIA rates as important, particularly the symptomatic ARIA that results in serious consequences in some patients. And that's probably what we need to focus on is the serious events rather than radiographic ARIA. Anne?\nAnne White: And then the timing, so as I think Dan mentioned during his words that we expect the data readout for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 in mid-'23. So our intention is to submit the data rapidly and we expect a timely review from the FDA for a supplemental submission. So that could lead to a traditional approval in the first half of 2024. And we certainly, as I mentioned, we expect that we would drive for reconsideration. We certainly hope that CMS would take that Phase III data and not wait for the additional approval to assess the situation. but then maybe also to your comment, we expect really limited uptake in the time of accelerated approval, use said, is an early '23 based on how the CED is currently written. So that's the time line that we're on.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim, for your question. I think we have two more questions.\nOperator: The next question is from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: Two for me. Just for SURMOUNT-MMO, following up on that I just want to understand why you're firing away to a more traditional 3-point base has been used in diabetes in the SELECT study. What evidence you have adding those 2 additional endpoints? And so why are you drawing a mortality rather than debt. Do you do include those endpoints and your broader eligibility criteria will expedite events? And then secondly, a question on therapeutic focus. You've taken the decision to move your PTL3 into Phase II cardiovascular disease. CME can be, I guess, an expensive risky therapeutic category to participate in. So assuming Phase II is positive, do you anticipate taking these pipelines, the assets on the way through to market alone? Or might you need to consider a partnership just your thought processes around this event decision would be interested?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry. Okay. So first question on Surmount MMO design and second one around Angptl3 and ASCVD maybe more in general, Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks two thoughtful questions there, Kerry. So starting with the SURMOUNT-MMO, you sort of asked why did we -- why are we doing more typical CV outcome studies in -- of course, you'll know that for drugs and diabetes, there was sort of an FDA requirement around this in the past that sort of focus people's attention on discharging risk. And then ultimately, we discovered that certain classes of drugs can actually provide a benefit.  Here, we're trying to go even beyond that observation and demonstrate what we believe to be true, which is that correcting obesity and correcting metabolism in these patients can have a wide range of benefits. And so that's why we've done 2 things there. We've gone beyond the traditional cardiovascular endpoints. This is primarily a cardiovascular drug. It's a drug that corrects metabolism. And we think that will have broader benefits, including, hopefully, and importantly, all cause mortality.  And then second, we've got to a broader population so that we can show the benefit in that group. So that's our thinking here. And I think it's a natural evolution of this class of drugs as we go forward. With respect to ANGPTL3, you ask about our Phase II and what do we do if we get a positive result. Of course, the reason we do these Phase II trials is to look for promising drugs for patients.  I think in cardiovascular, you rightly point out that it's a high-risk area with big Phase III studies that sometimes carry risk into them. In this case, there's a reasonable understanding of this mechanism and how to translate from 2 to 3 -- Phase II to Phase III. But still, what we're focused on is finding a large effect size drug here. And if we can see a big effect in Phase II that would predict a positive strong signal in a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study then that's exactly what we'll do. In terms of whether that's a thing Lilly does alone or partners, it's probably premature to talk about anything like that.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry. Lois, you want to take the last question?\nOperator: And that's from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: I guess my first question is on Mounjaro. So we talked -- you talked about the whole call, I think, about supply and trends. But can you talk a little bit about the individual dosing like what doses are being used the most? And if you do incur like higher than what you predict demand, what dosage levels might be greatest impacted. I think you had 30% switching and 70% new. So it's the low doses that would go first or the mid doses? And second, on Alzheimer's, we're hearing a lot of doctors say that you have the mind share of the for Abeta class drugs. Can you talk a little bit about what you think is the most important thing that resonates with doctors? Is it subcu? Is it frequent dosing, is it the magnitude of benefit as we think about the speed of uptake once full drug's reimbursed?\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Robyn. So Mike, do you want to handle the question on the dosing dynamics? And then with regard to AD and that mind share question, Anne will fill that. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. I think dosing titration in the real world is different than our clinical studies and the clinical studies we needed to test, what the dose response was going to be 5, 10 and 15. So in our clinical studies, we titrated every 4 weeks up to additional doses in order to be able to have expedited trials and show the benefit. In real world, what you see is that people will start on a dose, they start at 2.5, they go to 5.  And then what we're seeing is that physicians will hold there and see how they respond and 5 milligrams provides really good efficacy for people living with type 2 diabetes. If they need more, then they'll escalate the dose. It may not be at the 4-week mark, it maybe at a 3-month mark. So those trends are still established in the marketplace, but the vast majority of our volume is in the 2.5 and 5 milligrams.  I want to make sure you're not reading too much into my earlier comments around shortages at any particular dose. My comments earlier were just saying, hey, there's a lot of factors that's going on. There's a lot of dynamics. You've got to plan your manufacturing down at the SKU dosing levels a month or 2 ahead of actually when it's for us. And so will every dose line up perfectly with what the demand is needed for that week in the marketplace. It may not. And if it does, then a dose or 2 may not be able to get the order that week, and then we'll adjust quickly. And our team work very closely and very hard to make sure it doesn't impact patients.\nAnne White: Great. Thanks for the comment on having the mind share. We appreciate that. And I think -- as I reflect on that question, which is a good one, I think it's built over the decades that we've been investing in the Alzheimer's space. So we've been at this for more than 30 years, invested quite a bit of time and resources in this. And I think it led to, first of all, diagnostics being significantly evolved in this space with the launch of and that we have Tauvid, and then we also intend to launch a PTAL blood diagnostic next year, which could really improve access and diagnosis of these patients.  And so I think it starts out there with showing our commitment to making sure that the right patients on these therapies. And I do believe that, that was one of the pivot points for how we now have successful trials in this space by the ability to really confirm that people have this diagnosis. All of that learning over the years, all of the insights from the trials that we've had, some of the setbacks that we experienced led to the first positive trial that has happened in this space with the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and showing both significant and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque, but then most importantly, to everyone showing that, that truly slows the progression of the disease.  And so it's really, I think, some of that mind share is built on the commitment that we've shown to the space, the commitment we've had to making sure that patients truly get diagnosed in that. And that's what we're spending a lot of time in the first few months certainly of next year, as we work towards access for these patients is to make sure that we can drive early and accurate diagnosis.  We're so pleased with how donanemab has continued to perform. As I said, we believe, and I think lecanemab results reinforce what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ is that clearance of plaque is the key to this disease. And we know that donanemab does that. We look forward to sharing the TV4 data at CTAD. I think you'll see how that reinforces what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and then the design and what we believe will be the performance in TV2.  So I think that we deserve that mind share, but I think it's been earned over many years of supporting and investing in this space that has led to positive trials for us and for others. So it's rewarding, I think, for many of the scientists here to see the culmination of this. So -- but again, exciting times, cusp of real meaningful movement for people with Alzheimer's disease. And we really look forward to that readout next year and our accelerated approval early next year as well.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Robin, for the question.

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q3, let me highlight a change in how we expect to communicate our acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. In mid-October, we filed an 8-K with the SEC to provide investors earlier clarity on the impact from acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges for Q3. In future quarters, we generally expect to provide this information for quarterly updates on our Investor Relations website.  Now moving to our results. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2022 and I'll focus my overall comments on non-GAAP performance. A few notable items affected year-over-year comparisons in Q3. Foreign exchange rates had a roughly 430 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as Q3 revenue grew by 2% or 7% on a constant currency basis. We recognized $86 million of revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan; we experienced the first full quarter impact of Alimta's U.S. Fed expiry; and the increase in sales of COVID-19 antibodies and the decrease in sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 impacted our results.  When excluding revenue from Alimta, which is now off patent across the EU, Japan and the U.S., COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue grew 9% for the quarter or 14% in constant currency, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin was roughly flat year-over-year, the impact of lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs were offset by favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19 and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.  Total operating expenses increased 1% this quarter. Growth in marketing, selling and administrative expenses and R&D expenses were largely offset by lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges that reduced operating expense growth by nearly 350 basis points. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 2%, primarily driven by the increased cost associated with the launch of Mounjaro, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 6%, driven by higher development expense for late-stage assets, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies.  Operating income increased 6% in Q3, primarily due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributable to the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges.  Our Q3 effective tax rate was 10.7%, a decrease of 360 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the favorable tax impact related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased approximately 12% this quarter to $1.98 per share. Acquired IPR&D and development milestone charge and a negative impact of $0.06 in Q3 2022 compared to $0.17 in the same period last year.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, foreign exchange movements primarily related to the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar, decreased revenue by 4%.  Moving to our performance by key geography. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% driven by volume growth of 15%. Excluding revenue from Alimta, COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the treatment of COVID-19, revenue in the U.S. increased 20% driven primarily by key growth products. U.S. volume growth was partially offset by a net price decline of 4%, driven primarily by lower realized prices for Humalog due to segment mix and the list price reduction for insulin Lispro injection.  Moving to Europe. Revenue grew 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, Verzenio and Taltz. We are encouraged by the momentum of our business in Europe and expect continued growth as the impact from the patent expiry for Alimta, which lost exclusively in June 2021, received from base period comparison.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased by 2% in constant currency. The growth of our newer medicine and revenue related to a sales collaboration agreement for the rights to sell and distribute Mounjaro in Japan was more than offset by the continued impact of declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta, which both face generic entry in June 2021. We expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023 as we continue to scale our key growth products and the impact of patent expiration subsides.  In China, revenue declined 10% in constant currency as we continue to be impacted by the Zero COVID policy measures. We're also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures for Tyvyt from local competitors with NR DLXs. In addition, we experienced the first full quarter of the pricing impact of volume-based procurement for Humalog. As we expect to maintain a high level of access for our innovative portfolio, we believe our volume should accelerate to drive net growth in the future.  Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 6% in constant currency in Q3, primarily driven by customer buying patterns. The year-to-date growth of 8% in constant currency in this region is more representative underlying trends.  As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust waterwide volume growth. These products drove approximately 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our current performance and future outlook.  Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of a key growth product. This quarter, these brands grew 19% or 25% in constant currency, generated $4.6 billion in sales and made up 70% of our core business revenue. Products like Verzenio, Taltz in dermatology and Jardiance have outpaced competitors growth and are leaders in new-to-brand share of market within their respective classes.  In the injectable incretin market, we continue to see significant opportunity for further class growth. In addition to Mounjaro successful launch in the U.S., Trulicity has continued to experience strong growth globally. To date, our incretin manufacturing production is ahead of our internal plan, and we remain focused on sustaining this performance.  Strong demand for Trulicity, partially due to ongoing limited availability of competitive GLP-1, continues to challenge our ability to meet expanding demand in most international markets. In those situations, we're working hard to supply market demand will minimize an impact to existing patients, including communication in these markets not to initiate new patients on Trulicity. In the U.S., script volume remains robust. And while we build more capacity, wholesalers may experience intermittent restocking delays of Trulicity orders.  Moving to Slide 11. We're pleased with the rapid uptake of Mounjaro in the first 4 months since launch. Approximately 70% of Mounjaro's new therapy starts are patients naive to the type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class and less than 10% for switches from Trulicity. We are progressing peer negotiations and have more than doubled the level of access to approximately 45% of total commercial and Part D lives. And as we expand access, the proportion of paid script should start to increase.  Our focus is to make Mounjaro available for type 2 diabetes patients, and we intend to take actions designed to ensure access and supply for these patients. These actions may negatively impact prescription volume, but are not expected to impact net revenue. We have seen unprecedented demand for Mounjaro's type 2 diabetes launch in the U.S., bolstered by strong efficacy and a positive customer experience. Availability of competitor's incretin also is a key factor as we assess Mounjaro's demand and supply.  To meet this rapidly growing demand across our incretin business, we have plans to add substantial additional manufacturing capacity. In 2023, we expect the RTP site in North Carolina to become fully operational and that capacity, coupled with additional actions and extensions in other sites, will result in doubling Lilly's incretin manufacturing capacity at the end of 2023.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first 9 months of the year, we invested $6.8 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders in dividend and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities are to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, bolster manufacturing capacity, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders.  Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook now includes an additional $300 million of headwinds from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $1 billion of foreign exchange headwinds of revenue for the full year compared to our original guidance. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged.  Our guidance now includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $670 million, reflecting total charges in the first 9 months of the year. We have not recognized material acquired IPR&D or development milestone charges to date in Q4. And this guidance does not include any impact from the potential acquisition -- for business development or acquisition in the remainder of the year, including pending acquisition of [indiscernible]. Our non-GAAP operating margins remain unchanged at approximately 29%.  On a reported basis, operating margin is now expected to be approximately 26%, driven by the intangible asset impairment for our GBA1 Gene Therapy due to change in estimated launch timing. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expensed in the range of $600 million to $700 million, reflecting the net impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during Q3 2022.  Our tax rate and EPS in the first 9 months of the year includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year continues to assume this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for the full year 2022.  Assuming this deferral repeal occurs before the end of the year, we expect our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 22%, which includes the cumulative tax impact of immediately expensing research and development costs for the full year 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repeal effective this year, then we would expect our reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%.  Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.46 to now be in the range of $6.50 to $6.65 per share and lowered our 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.20 to be in the range of $7.70 to $7.85. The $0.20 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates as well as the $0.06 impact from the incremental acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges in Q3.  Now before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to provide a few thoughts on the pushes and pulls across the P&L as you begin to think about next year. Starting with revenue, we're confident in the growth outlook of our core business. We expect to build on the positive momentum across our pre-growth products, including the continued strong launch of Mounjaro and launches of new products. While we anticipate that initial revenue from our next wave of potential launches will be modest in 2023 with only partial year revenue, we do expect the donanemab, pitubrutinib, mirikizumab and lebrikizumab will serve as additional catalysts for continued growth.  In 2023, we will see the full year impact of the Alimta's patent expiry in the U.S., where new generics have eroded Alimta sales starting mid-Q2 and we anticipate a low single-digit headwind from foreign exchange rates. As for revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, we will continue to make bebtelovimab available for purchase. However, the demand for these therapies will depend not only on COVID-19 case counts but also on evolving variants and available therapies. We continue to believe that COVID-19 antibodies will not be a major driver for long-term growth for Lilly.  We will invest in our future as we advance promising R&D opportunities, expand our manufacturing capacity and support the potential launch of multiple new products. Assuming inflation persist, we expect to see that impact in 2023 as well. Also, we will be making a significant investment in one of our most important assets, our talented workforce, through increases in compensation that are partially due to inflation pressures, but also to ensure we have the right capabilities to deliver on the promise of our future growth.  While these investments will slow our operating margin expansion in 2023, they are critical to maximizing pipeline and new launch opportunities to help sustain top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion over the mid- to long term. We look forward to sharing more details on our 2023 guidance call on December 13.  Now I'll turn over the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D."

            "name": "Anne White",
            "content": "Thanks so much for the question on Remternetug. Obviously, we're excited that we've initiated the Phase III program. And as you noted, we've started the first study, which is to assess amyloid lowering. We have a broader Phase III program that we're initiating as well, looking at the clinical endpoints as we've done for donanemab, but we're excited about what we're seeing so far with Remternetug, which was the next generation.  And so you're going to see us continue to invest in the AD platform going forward based on donanemab's compelling data and then where we're seeing early, it was on Remternetug. And as you said, it offers the convenience of an additional dosing form that we think will offer a lot of convenience to patients. On your question around the NCD, obviously, we hope now that CMS, we now have the Phase II data from donanemab, which clearly showed clinical benefit as well as clearance of plaque. Now we have the lucanumab data, a large Phase III study also showing clinical benefit. Certainly, it's our position that this is time for CMS to reconsider this decision.  So certainly, we would hope that this is resolved before Remternetug reads out. Obviously, the time line though, is not clear. So what you'll see us do, and I'm sure is doing the same as soon as we have that Phase III data requesting reconsideration and moving forward with the evidence that's demonstrated today, we cannot see a reason that CMS will continue to prevent Alzheimer's patients from getting these medicines.  And as we've said in the past, we believe CD really is very restrictive method to provide to the patients who have this disease and also leads to disparity we've seen in care for Alzheimer's disease. So certainly, I hope that this will be resolved by the time we have Remternetug available to patients. Well, thanks for the question on the Clarity AD and maybe getting to your question, we absolutely see the data that we saw there is clinically meaningful. And clearly, patients, families, care partners highly value a delay in loss of independent stabilities. And so a 20% to 30% slowing of the disease initiated in the earliest stage of the disease should mean additional time in the more functional less impaired stages. So we're excited about those results, and we do think that they're clinically meaningful in this space.  And so we look forward, as we've said, to what we'll see with donanemab. There are many reasons that we're extremely confident about donanemab and those haven't changed. So obviously, it's a positive Phase II study that we were able to produce the choice of the endpoint that we have in our study, as you commented, patient selection strategy and then importantly, the speed and the depth of plaque clearance. So we remain very confident in what we'll see out of our upcoming readout on TD 2.  And then your question on, I think that just as we've said in the past, we believe that is the most robust endpoint in this space. And we've always believed that can be a bit of a noisy endpoint, and so indexing on exact numbers is probably not the best move there. But on TRAILBLAZER-ALZ, we powered it for Idris. We showed a 32% slowing, which we definitely see as clinically meaningful. And we believe that Idris will always perform closest to the truth. But in a large enough study, we expect all the endpoints will move similarly. So we continue to be confident about the choice of the Idris. We continue to be confident about the TP2 readout that we'll see in mid-2023. And then the timing, so as I think Dan mentioned during his words that we expect the data readout for TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 in mid-'23. So our intention is to submit the data rapidly and we expect a timely review from the FDA for a supplemental submission. So that could lead to a traditional approval in the first half of 2024. And we certainly, as I mentioned, we expect that we would drive for reconsideration. We certainly hope that CMS would take that Phase III data and not wait for the additional approval to assess the situation. but then maybe also to your comment, we expect really limited uptake in the time of accelerated approval, use said, is an early '23 based on how the CED is currently written. So that's the time line that we're on. Great. Thanks for the comment on having the mind share. We appreciate that. And I think -- as I reflect on that question, which is a good one, I think it's built over the decades that we've been investing in the Alzheimer's space. So we've been at this for more than 30 years, invested quite a bit of time and resources in this. And I think it led to, first of all, diagnostics being significantly evolved in this space with the launch of and that we have Tauvid, and then we also intend to launch a PTAL blood diagnostic next year, which could really improve access and diagnosis of these patients.  And so I think it starts out there with showing our commitment to making sure that the right patients on these therapies. And I do believe that, that was one of the pivot points for how we now have successful trials in this space by the ability to really confirm that people have this diagnosis. All of that learning over the years, all of the insights from the trials that we've had, some of the setbacks that we experienced led to the first positive trial that has happened in this space with the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and showing both significant and rapid clearance of amyloid plaque, but then most importantly, to everyone showing that, that truly slows the progression of the disease.  And so it's really, I think, some of that mind share is built on the commitment that we've shown to the space, the commitment we've had to making sure that patients truly get diagnosed in that. And that's what we're spending a lot of time in the first few months certainly of next year, as we work towards access for these patients is to make sure that we can drive early and accurate diagnosis.  We're so pleased with how donanemab has continued to perform. As I said, we believe, and I think lecanemab results reinforce what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ is that clearance of plaque is the key to this disease. And we know that donanemab does that. We look forward to sharing the TV4 data at CTAD. I think you'll see how that reinforces what we saw in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ and then the design and what we believe will be the performance in TV2.  So I think that we deserve that mind share, but I think it's been earned over many years of supporting and investing in this space that has led to positive trials for us and for others. So it's rewarding, I think, for many of the scientists here to see the culmination of this. So -- but again, exciting times, cusp of real meaningful movement for people with Alzheimer's disease. And we really look forward to that readout next year and our accelerated approval early next year as well."

            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. 2022 has been another outstanding year for R&D at Lilly. In addition to Mounjaro approval, we have now completed regulatory submissions for 4 new medicines that could all launch by the end of 2023: portibrutinib, mirikizumab, lebrikizumab, and denetimab. In addition, we advanced our early-stage pipeline with promising next-generation assets in all of our key areas. Plus we've continued to improve our capabilities and advance our projects in our growing nucleic acid medicine portfolio.  Before I share an R&D update for our core business, let me briefly add to Anat's update on COVID-19 antibodies. While we've made bebtelovimab commercially available, we're also closely watching the emergence of new highly mutated strains. Based on pseudovirus data, we do not believe that bebtelovimab will neutralize against the new BQ variants. However, we do have potentially broadly neutralizing antibodies in our labs that we can consider bringing forward if there is a need and an aligned path forward with health authorities.  Moving to our core R&D portfolio. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28, and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover important developments since our last earnings call by therapeutic area.  Starting with diabetes and obesity. We have several updates for tirzepatide. For type 2 diabetes, in addition to the U.S. approval of Mounjaro in Q2, we're pleased to announce recent approvals in the EU and Japan. For chronic weight management, we're pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide. Fast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions that have the potential to fill an unmet medical need.  We plan to initiate a rolling submission this year that will be primarily based on the results from the SURMOUNT-1 trial, which is complete; and SURMOUNT-2, which is expected to be complete by the end of April 2023. Assuming positive SURMOUNT-2 results, we expect to complete the rolling submission with these data in mid-2023 for potential regulatory action as early as late next year. We're working hard to bring tirzepatide to adults living with obesity as soon as we can.  We also presented the trial design of tirzepatide SURMOUNT-MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality in obesity study. SURMOUNT-MMO evaluates treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo in adults living with obesity without diabetes and measures the effects of tirzepatide on a broad set of outcomes beyond traditional cardiovascular events. As our primary endpoint, we are measuring the occurrence of a cardiovascular event from a 5-point CV composite that includes all-cause mortality. We've also incorporated key secondary endpoints, including traditional MACE 3 events, reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and adverse renal outcomes.  In SURMOUNT-MMO, we are studying both primary and secondary prevention of events in a broader at-risk population more representative of that seen in clinical practice. The SURMOUNT-MMO study has now initiated, and we look forward to sharing the results in the future. SURMOUNT-MMO is just the latest addition to tirzepatide's development plan. where our goal is to not only demonstrate chronic weight management but also to demonstrate improvement across multiple outcomes as a result of weight loss. We're extremely confident in tirzepatide's potential to impact health outcomes of patients living with type 2 diabetes, obesity and other obesity-related metabolic outcomes.  Transitioning to the rest of our diabetes portfolio, we started 2 more Phase III studies for our weekly basal insulin FC and expect to start the fifth and final registration study in the Quint program in the coming months. We also received FDA approval for the Tempo Smart Button and medical device and key component of Lilly's forthcoming Tempo personalized diabetes management platform. We're excited to begin to introduce this platform to the marketplace this year.  Moving to oncology. In line with expectations previously communicated, we've now performed another interim analysis for MONARCH-E, our adjuvant high-risk early breast cancer study of Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. The results of this analysis will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium next month.  We're excited by what we've seen and we look forward to sharing the data publicly. Verzenio is the only CDK4/6 inhibitor approved in the adjuvant setting, and we are enthusiastic about Verzenio's ability to substantially reduce the risk of developing incurable life-threatening metastatic disease.  We also announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval to Retevmo for pretreated adults with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion regardless of tumor type. And also granted traditional approval for Retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with a RET gene fusion as detected by an FDA-approved test. We're grateful to have the opportunity to deliver meaningful clinical benefits to more patients across more tumor types with Retevmo.  We also began dosing patients in our fifth Phase III study for pirtobrutinib. This latest trial is a head-to-head study evaluating pirtobrutinib against ibrutinib in BTK inhibitor-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As a reminder, pirtobrutinib is currently under priority review at the FDA and for mantle cell lymphoma previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with regulatory action expected in early 2023. We also continue to have discussions with the FDA about potentially accelerating the approval pathway for CLL in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.  Switching to immunology. We presented detailed week 52 results from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy studies in patients with moderate to spare atopic dermatitis at 2 recent dermatology conferences. The maintenance data showed that lebrikizumab provided robust and durable skin clearance with improvements in itch, sleep and quality of life amongst patients who achieved a clinical response in the 16-week induction period.  Notably, the results also suggested that less frequent dosing of lebrikizumab can provide similar improvements to once every 2-week dosing. Based upon the data we've collected across our trials in over 2,000 patients, we believe lebrikizumab could become a first-line biologic for treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a disease where there's significant need to provide new options for a large and diverse patient population.  As part of our efforts to reach a diverse patient population, we've recently initiated an innovative clinical trial to evaluate lebrikizumab for people with skin of color who have a disproportionately higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis and often struggle with more severe forms of the disease. We have now submitted a BLA to the FDA. And Almirall, who holds rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for dermatologic indications in Europe, has submitted to the EMA for authorization. We expect regulatory decisions in both the U.S. and the EU by the end of next year. Together with Almirall, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease.  Shifting to our efforts in genetic medicines. You'll see that we have now advanced our ANGPTL3 siRNA to Phase II development in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This is our first siRNA asset to advance to Phase II. And with this molecule, alongside our Lp(a) siRNA, where we shared proof-of-concept data last year, we're optimistic about the prospect of improving cardiovascular outcomes using our portfolio of genetic medicines.  Within gene therapy, we're excited about the opportunity to help patients with fatal neurodegenerative diseases, where we're advancing our Prevail Therapeutics programs. We particularly look forward to sharing biomarker results from our progranulin gene therapy program at an upcoming scientific meeting for frontal temporal dementia.  Building on our gene therapy experience with Prevail, we're thrilled to welcome Akouos and their talented team who will bring a transformational gene therapy approach to treating genetically defined hearing loss. Hearing loss is an area of severe unmet need that historically has not been a focus of pharmacologic development. And we believe treatment of sensory neuronal hearing loss through gene therapy delivered to the inner ear is an area ripe for technologic advances for the benefit of patients.  Finally, let me turn to Alzheimer's disease, where there have been a number of important developments since our last call. As a company dedicated to the fight against Alzheimer's, we were pleased to see the positive top line Phase III results for lecanemab. Following dunetimab's TRAILBLAZER-ALZ study, this lecanumab study may further support the benefit of removing amyloid plaques for people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.  These data certainly reinforce our confidence in donanemab and the forthcoming readout from our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, which is expected by the middle of 2023, and which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. In the meantime, we continue working with the FDA to seek accelerated approval in early '23 and based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data.  The availability of and access to safe and effective therapies is important to slow the devastating impact on the estimated 6.5 million Americans and 35 million people worldwide living with this disease and their loved ones. While we acknowledge the hard work ahead to bring these therapies to patients in need, we are excited and we are confident in our Alzheimer's disease portfolio and the potential impact our drugs can have on patients.  Accordingly, we initiated TRAILRUNNER-ALZ, the first trial in our Phase III program for Remternetug, our next-generation anti-amyloid antibody. Remternetug has demonstrated deep and rapid amyloid plaque clearance and provides the opportunity to explore flexible dosing regimens for patients.  Finally, in TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 4, our head-to-head trial comparing donanemab to aducanumab on amyloid plaque lowering in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, we have now achieved positive results on the co-primary endpoints of amyloid lowering as expected with a consistent safety profile to previous donanemab studies. For this study, the incidence of ARIA-E in the donanemab group was 21.1%, with 2.8% of donanemab-treated patients showing symptomatic ARIA-E, suggesting the potential that rates of plaque clearance are not directly linked to rates of ARIA development. We'll share the detailed results at the upcoming CTAD meeting in late November, including the relationship between the degree of amyloid plaque removal and plasma phospo tau, as well as radiographic area.  While we focus most of our markets today on late-stage assets, you also notice we have a number of developments across our early-stage portfolio as shown on the slides. Across the pipeline, Q3 was another productive quarter at Lilly.  Now I turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the question on SURMOUNT-2 here in FDA requirements. Maybe I'll just start off by relieving any worries that there's any specific concerns with the data or safety or anything like that. We don't see anything such as that driving FDA concerns. I think the FDA discussion around having 2 trials is just to be consistent with FDA guidance for adequate and well-controlled studies in chronic weight management that for that indication, having multiple studies in a population with obesity with primary endpoints defined as per the guidance on thresholds of weight loss is the requirement. And that's the requirement of being held to have 2 studies. Geoff, thanks for the question on future indications for tirzepatide. There are many that we can consider. As you point out, weight loss and restoration of sort of normal metabolism, which we think may be possible with tirzepatide is going to have benefits in a lot of metabolic- and obesity-related diseases. So how do we pick which ones to pursue and when.  I think initially, our thinking has been around generating a body of data that shows that a drug such as tirzepatide when driving weight loss lead to downstream health benefits. So that's what drives the MMO study. We have a heart failure study, a sleep apnea study that are all ongoing. When we think about adding more, sort of where can we see improvements in that medical understanding of the dangers of obesity and the benefits of weight loss and restoration of normal metabolism.  That's how we think about it rather than how big is this patient segment or how big is the next patient segment, noting that almost all of those patient segments will already have obesity as an underlying disease, which we expect to have indicated next year, as I commented earlier. Finally, I think one more consideration here, Geoff, for us is we see fighting obesity as a long-term goal for loan company. And so there'll be multiple generations of drugs here, we hope. And we'll have lots of opportunities to contribute to our medical understanding of weight loss. Thanks, Chris, our understanding is that we'll submit based on SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2, as we said, and we don't anticipate needing SURMOUNT-3 and 4 for that submission. So no implications to time line from those study readouts. Yes. Starting with how we think about obesity and in general as much as possible here, our strategy has been to mimic the body's own response to food. So incretins are hormone submitted by -- secreted rather by your gastrointestinal tract in response to eating then lead to satiety and increased calorie expenditure and decreased food intake. That's how they work and GID is one of the major incretins.  So it made sense to pursue a strategy of agonism of that hormone and probably we'll wait and see Amgen's data to understand if antagonism could also have a surprising effect different than the biological effect of acreages normally in humans. With respect to GGG and, I think BCG is our next-generation incretin that's further ahead in development. We've previously communicated that we expect to have internal Phase II data yet this year and use that data to make a decision whether this proceeds to Phase III or not. In which case, we might wait for mastatide data.  That thinking is still consistent and on track for yet this year. The second line of question here was around donanemab discrete dosing strategy, and you're referring here to the notion that we pioneered that once plaques are clear, you can stop taking a plaque-clearing antibody. That was based on our understanding of the biology, nothing to do with antidrug antibodies.  But certainly, we see it as a benefit for patients to not have to continue to take a drug in the absence of having the target or the disease in their brain that's still ongoing. It's pretty specific idea to donanemab, Remternetug and antibodies that are specific to plaques because once the plaques are gone, they're something for the antibodies to do. Our own data that we've shared show that there is no reversion really of adverse biomarkers in patients who've come off therapy. So so far, the data that we have in hand, though it's still early, supports cessation of dosing as appropriate. We'll look to TRAILBLAZER-2 to confirm that hypothesis. Okay. Yes. And then I'll -- I think your last question there, Tim, was on ARIA rates, which I'll maybe take as well. So again, I think I've said before, there's a number of factors here that can help us in predicting results of amyloid lowering drugs. Probably the most important one in our view is the degree of amyloid lowering and there, we're really pleased with what we've seen with donanemab. But lecanumab is probably also a pretty powerful amyloid-lowering drug.  Certainly a positive readout from a Phase III of one of these 3 drugs has got to increase your odds of success of 1 of -- or both of the other 2. But I just sort of remind us all that Alzheimer's has been a risky area with studies that are sometimes hard to predict. So we take some caution. Of course, we'd love to see more positive studies and more news for patients -- good news for patients.  I think before I turn it over to Anne for the other question, I just sort of take ARIA-E and lecanemab data. I think it's a little bit hard to do cross-trial comparisons of rates for a couple of reasons that I think are important, maybe we can talk more about at our scientific presentation at CTAD. Just sort of noting that TRAILBLAZER is probably the first time anyone's ever done within trial comparison of 2 different drugs to be able to compare ARIA.  Why is that important? When you're looking at 2 different trials, first of all, you have different patient populations. I think we'll probably learn over time that ARIA rates depend on the stage of disease and are more common in patients with more severe brain pathology. I think that's likely to be true. Second, even in the same population, how you measure ARIA can be very different in different trials, for example. Lecanemab has different timings of MRI than donanemab has used if you have more MRIs or earlier MRIs as we do, I think.  You're more likely to pick up more radiographic ARIA. So that's another caution on cross-trial comparisons. However, I do see ARIA rates as important, particularly the symptomatic ARIA that results in serious consequences in some patients. And that's probably what we need to focus on is the serious events rather than radiographic ARIA. Anne? Yes. Thanks two thoughtful questions there, Kerry. So starting with the SURMOUNT-MMO, you sort of asked why did we -- why are we doing more typical CV outcome studies in -- of course, you'll know that for drugs and diabetes, there was sort of an FDA requirement around this in the past that sort of focus people's attention on discharging risk. And then ultimately, we discovered that certain classes of drugs can actually provide a benefit.  Here, we're trying to go even beyond that observation and demonstrate what we believe to be true, which is that correcting obesity and correcting metabolism in these patients can have a wide range of benefits. And so that's why we've done 2 things there. We've gone beyond the traditional cardiovascular endpoints. This is primarily a cardiovascular drug. It's a drug that corrects metabolism. And we think that will have broader benefits, including, hopefully, and importantly, all cause mortality.  And then second, we've got to a broader population so that we can show the benefit in that group. So that's our thinking here. And I think it's a natural evolution of this class of drugs as we go forward. With respect to ANGPTL3, you ask about our Phase II and what do we do if we get a positive result. Of course, the reason we do these Phase II trials is to look for promising drugs for patients.  I think in cardiovascular, you rightly point out that it's a high-risk area with big Phase III studies that sometimes carry risk into them. In this case, there's a reasonable understanding of this mechanism and how to translate from 2 to 3 -- Phase II to Phase III. But still, what we're focused on is finding a large effect size drug here. And if we can see a big effect in Phase II that would predict a positive strong signal in a Phase III cardiovascular outcome study then that's exactly what we'll do. In terms of whether that's a thing Lilly does alone or partners, it's probably premature to talk about anything like that."

            "name": "Michael Mason",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Chris, for the questions. I appreciate that. As we guided before launch, we recommended that you look at more revenue. It was a better indicator of our performance than net revenue. We took 2 decisions that were really focused on looking at generating long-term value for Mounjaro. First, we decided to put in place a bridging program that would bridge people who have type 2 diabetes with a low out-of-pocket cost of $25 until they achieved formulary access on their insurance. We were confident that we were going to build, and we still are confident that we're going to build good broad access for Mounjaro.  But we wanted to make sure that we had a bridging program in that then allowed us to be disciplined and patient as we gained access. We wanted to make sure that we look for the long term, not the short term. If you're too short term-focused, then you're going to be driven to gain access quickly and not make the right pricing decisions. So we thought the bridging program tied with the disciplined negotiation approach was the best approach. And that's the one we've taken and that's the 1 we've held true to during our launch.  So what we'll see is net price will increase as we gain payer access. In the third quarter, we had 22% of people with commercial and Part D insurance had formerly access Mounjaro. As of October 1, that jumped to 45%. And what we anticipate is we'll still take a disciplined moderated approach to make sure we get the best access for the right price point. And we're still very confident that we will grow and we'll achieve broad access in the upcoming future.  We are also adjusting our bridging program to further ensure that it's utilized for people with type 2 diabetes, which will impact new start volume but should impact net revenue. So we expect over the upcoming quarters that net price will grow for Mounjaro. As it comes to supply, our supply chain has performed exceptionally well since launch. We're taking actions to maximize production supply for our current facilities while we ramp up our new manufacturing facilities that you referenced.  The U.S. Mounjaro launch is really unprecedented with a viral nature given just tremendous patient satisfaction and the visible results that people experience that really spark many conversations with them, the type 2 diabetes community, which then brings greater interest in the type 2 diabetes committee, our community for Mounjaro. But it is a dynamic situation, given the uncertainty of competitor GLP supply and that Mounjaro patient prescription abandonment long-term adherence and dose titration rates have it yet with steady-state, which are all important forecasting assumptions.  So given the dynamic nature of this, it's reasonable to assume that weekly production forecast won't perfectly aligned with weekly demand each week. So this will produce some intermittent delays in meeting wholesale orders for some dosing strengths as we ramp up our supply chain. If this happens, our teams will work hard to avoid or minimize any short-term impact for people that with type 2 diabetes. But stepping back and taking a look at the longer-term picture, we're in a great position.  Mounjaro's launch is going extremely well because patient experiences have been tremendous, and they have a high interest in the product profile. We expect Mounjaro's launch has fueled significant increment market growth which I think just gives us more confidence in the future. And we had the foresight to initiate significant manufacturing capacity expansion before Mounjaro launch because we saw the potential of the product. So we're in a very good long-term position with Mounjaro. Yes, all manufacturing supply, I'll reinforce that our main manufacturing supply and teammates have delivered exceptional results, and they continue to look for every way to maximize our production supply. They have all hands on deck to get the Research Triangle Park facility online as soon as possible. And as soon as that facility is available, we'll make good use of that supply.  So we're confident in our ability for our manufacturing personnel and our leadership there. And as I said before, we're very confident in the long-term potential of tirzepatide. With the bridging program, I think your question was more around kind of off-label use of Mounjaro and how much it was.  As you know, Mounjaro was approved in the U.S. for patients with type 2 diabetes, and we have just excellent processes in place to ensure that all promotional activities are in line with our approved label. We're pleased with our disciplined on-label promotional execution. The launch of Mounjaro has been very disciplined and in line with everything that we wanted. So we've been encouraged by both patients and physicians prescribing experiences, and this has driven a very high interest in Mounjaro.  We haven't -- we don't have perfect data to suggest what diagnosis a patient has. The best data that we have is to look at the -- whether those individuals who are starting Mounjaro, whether they have previously been on a diabetes medication or not. Given that our promotion is focused solely on type 2 diabetes, we would expect to see the majority of people use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, and that's what we've seen.  While we see fluctuation from week to week in the third quarter, we saw about 2/3 of new patients starting Mounjaro with a history of type 2 diabetes medications. For the remaining 1/3 of patients who are classified as naive to treatment -- diabetes treatments, these individuals could either be newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients or individuals who haven't yet been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Okay. Good question. Inventory contributions to Q3 sales was 40%. But I also note that as soon as a product shifts our product, we accrue for rebates and discounts whether that product is used to supply patient demand in the pharmacy or whether that's used in the channel for inventory. As it comes to gross to net, the big change is, if you look at the Trulicity launch versus the Mounjaro launch is we did not have a bridging program at the launch of Trulicity like we do for Mounjaro. Yes. What you typically see is actually the switching for a new product into our incretin class is typically the switch rates people switching from another incretin to the launch incretin, those rates will actually go down over time. And so that's what I would anticipate. The real opportunity here is to grow the market and make sure that before being proactive to treat type 2 diabetes. Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. Actually, with obesity, it's actually kind of counter to what typically happens to the product. Typically, you get it out, it has a finite patient segmentation, you try to explain that with additional indications. Actually, with obesity, you're going to have the broadest indication for people who either have a BMI of 27 with a risk factor or a BMI over 30, which is a massive population in the U.S. and globally.  And so the additions of our trials aren't necessarily to expand the patient population, but is to demonstrate that proactively treating obesity will improve health outcomes in order to drive physicians to write and payers to give access for the product. Okay. Thanks, David, for the question. Yes, the percent that was comp from channel was in a U.S. figure. On the -- when you look at our data and you look at percent covered scripts that were paid versus paid through the savings card, that rate in -- since launch has closely matched our access rates. So I would say that's the best indicator for kind of the percent that are paid versus going through the bridging program. Okay. On the oral GLP market, I mean, in our market research, consumers are very interested in oral products, both in type 2 diabetes and obesity. And so the prospects of an oral anti-obesity product is very attractive. So we're very encouraged by that opportunity and are excited by our NPA program. As it comes to the positive CV study, if Novo is able to get that with semaglutide, to me, it's -- it's more of an opportunity to show the benefits of the products in the class.  I think any additional benefits that are represented by whether it be our trials or Novo trials are going to help the class and help more payers and more health care professionals take action on the product. And so I think their trial will provide good information and good data for health care professionals and payers. And while our trial is a little bit different, and we think is a little bit broader in nature, we think that will also expand it.  So to me, it's not a comparing our study, the SURMOUNT-MMO study versus SELECT, it's more new information is going to be good for the class, good for health care professionals. We really should be treating obesity a lot more proactive than what we do today. And I think those trials will show the need for that. Andrew, I think you're thinking about it correctly. When Rybelsus launched, we expected it to grow the class, not impact the injectable market, and that's exactly what happened. It was more additive to the class. And then as Mounjaro is launched, we only see 1% of Mounjaro's demand coming from Rybelsus or oral GLP. So I think you're right. I think it is additive versus attractive, and we're very pleased with the opportunity.  I think in the oral market, what's going to be key is Rybelsus has some interactions with water and food, which have some dosing limitations, which can impact the efficacy of the product, if it's not followed closely as well as there's a gap between the efficacy of oral Rybelsus and injectables. So I think as you get alternatives in place that doesn't have that food and water interaction as the efficacy of the orals increase, you'll see the market potential even being higher, and that's exactly what we plan to deliver, hopefully, with NPA. Okay. Maybe I'll take another shot at obesity access and how we see it develop over time. I think Dave talked about back if it's going to take a steady drumbeat of evidence and every payer, every employer will make the decision independently and that will grow over time. The other approach that we're taking is we're studying our tirzepatide for other indications for people who live with obesity like heart failure and sleep apnea.  These are indications that are already supported by commercial and Medicare Part D. And so we believe that as we get access and demonstrate efficacy there and get indications that, that in itself will unlock subsets of payer access for people who live with obesity who have sleep apnea or heart failure as we continue to build toward our -- the results of the MMO study. So I think it will grow over time, but I think those 2 events are important events in the life cycle of tirzepatide. Yes, I'm happy to answer that question. I think dosing titration in the real world is different than our clinical studies and the clinical studies we needed to test, what the dose response was going to be 5, 10 and 15. So in our clinical studies, we titrated every 4 weeks up to additional doses in order to be able to have expedited trials and show the benefit. In real world, what you see is that people will start on a dose, they start at 2.5, they go to 5.  And then what we're seeing is that physicians will hold there and see how they respond and 5 milligrams provides really good efficacy for people living with type 2 diabetes. If they need more, then they'll escalate the dose. It may not be at the 4-week mark, it maybe at a 3-month mark. So those trends are still established in the marketplace, but the vast majority of our volume is in the 2.5 and 5 milligrams.  I want to make sure you're not reading too much into my earlier comments around shortages at any particular dose. My comments earlier were just saying, hey, there's a lot of factors that's going on. There's a lot of dynamics. You've got to plan your manufacturing down at the SKU dosing levels a month or 2 ahead of actually when it's for us. And so will every dose line up perfectly with what the demand is needed for that week in the marketplace. It may not. And if it does, then a dose or 2 may not be able to get the order that week, and then we'll adjust quickly. And our team work very closely and very hard to make sure it doesn't impact patients."

            "content": "Yes, sure. So as Dan mentioned in the prepared remarks, we conducted a preplanned interim analysis of Monarch as we had talked about earlier in the year that we were going to do that. So of course, we looked at all of the endpoints, IDFS, DRFS and overall survival. We'll be presenting those at San Antonio. Really pleased with what we've seen across the study in both the ITT population cohort 1 as well as the currently labeled indication.  I think there's two components to think about here. One is, how do the data continue to evolve with increased follow-up? And the second is, how does the new analysis look as it relates to potentially expanding our labeled indication over time. And obviously, I want to be careful about reviewing the data themselves, but I think those are the 2 questions that you ought to think about as you see the data in December."

            "name": "David Ricks",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Joe. Over the last three months, we continued to successfully execute our strategy. On the commercial front, we drove strong volume-based growth of our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro, which has seen an impressive initial uptick. At the same time, we advanced our late-phase pipeline progressing towards potential launches of 4 new medicines by the end of next year while also investing in our early-stage pipeline and new modalities like gene therapy. To meet the growing demand for our products and prepare for future launches, we have also continued to invest in expansion of our manufacturing footprint.  I'd highlight 2 areas of high unmet need where Lilly is progressing new medicines to improve patient outcomes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease. In obesity, we are pleased that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, enabling us to potentially bring this promising medicine to patients even sooner. We're also initiating SURMOUNT MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity.  In Alzheimer's disease, our Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2study for dunenumab continues to progress towards a top line readout in mid-2023. And we continue to work with the FDA to pursue an accelerated approval based on our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ data. We also announced completion of our submission for lebrikizumab in atopic dermatitis in both the U.S. and the EU. With already completed submissions for donanemab, pertibrutinib, mirikizumab. We are excited by the potential to launch 4 new medicines between now and the end of 2023. We are experiencing an unprecedented rate of new product launches for Lilly and undoubtedly 1 of the most impressive rates in our industry.  Turning to our strategic deliverables on Slide 4. Q3 revenue grew 7% in constant currency. Worldwide volume grew a robust 14%. Key product growth grew 19% and now account for 70% of our core business revenue, a reflection of the youth and durability of our marketed product portfolio. We're encouraged to see the continued global adoption of products like Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance and our anchor [indiscernible] medicines, including Mounjaro and Trulicity.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in Q3, which is in line with the same period last year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 28.9%, which includes a negative impact of approximately 90 basis points attributed to acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges.  For pipeline milestones, we shared several important updates since our Q2 earnings call, including FDA Fast Track designation for tirzepatide for adults with obesity, with completion of a rolling submission expected by mid-2023; EU and Japan approval for Mounjaro for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes; U.S. and EU submission of lebrikizumab for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis; and FDA accelerated approval for Retevmo in RET fusion-positive advanced or metastatic solid tumors regardless of tumor type and traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer.  Dan will discuss this in more detail later but we are excited to have announced the acquisition of Akros, which aims to accelerate efforts in gene therapies that promise to restore, improve and preserve hearing for patients living with disabling hearing loss. This acquisition demonstrates our continued commitment to advancing genetic medicine at Lilly. And finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders.  On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 earnings call, including several important personnel, COVID-19 antibody and ESG updates. We announced the upcoming retirement of Steve Fry, our Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Diversity, following more than 35 years at our company. I'd like to thank Steve for playing a key role in advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and leading our efforts to be the premier employer in our region and our sector.  We also welcome Eric Dozier, who will succeed Steve. Eric has nearly 25 years of experience at Lilly and a strong track record of developing people and teams that deliver impressive business results. I'm confident he is the right leader to progress our people strategy, which is vital for Lilly to achieve our ambitious growth objectives ahead.  In August, we began to make our COVID-19 antibody beptilizumab available for purchase to states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor. In Q3, we shipped an additional 600,000 -- or 60,000, I should say, doses of beptilizumab to the U.S. government for approximately $110 million. These are to be used for the financially vulnerable patients through a product replacement program. At this time, we are not anticipating any further U.S. government orders for beptilizumab.  With regards to our ESG efforts, we published our inaugural sustainability bond allocation and impact report, highlighting the allocation of approximately EUR 128 million across a range of sustainability projects since the issuance of the sustainability bond in September of '21. For more information about this and the many other aspects of our ESG program, you can visit our Lilly ESG website.  Now I'll turn the call over to Anat for a more detailed review of our Q3 results. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the third quarter. We continue to grow our recently launched medicines, including Mounjaro's strong U.S. launch. At the same time, we continue to advance our pipeline, progressing towards potential launches for 4 new medicines by the end of next year, while also internally and externally investing in our early-stage pipeline and discovery capabilities. With the progress we've made, we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects.  Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Chris. I think maybe I'll go to Mike for both the first question on gross to net trends and access and for some commentary on manufacturing capacity. Mike? Thanks, Terence. Mike? Thanks, Umer. So Mike, go back to you on both questions. First one on inventory contribution to Q2 sales, and then the second on the gross to net and how that would compare versus what we saw with Trulicity. Thanks, Steve. So first for the question about the FDA and submission for tirzepatide for obesity, we'll go to Dan. And then your second question around the collaboration agreement in Japan, we'll go to Ilya. So Dan? Thanks, Dan. Ilya, do you want to take the question around the Japan tirzepatide? Thanks, Geoff. So Mike, we'll go to you for the question around sequential trends and what we expect -- might expect in terms of ongoing switch rates, and then Dan, we'll go to you for prioritization of tirzepatide development plans. Mike? Thanks, Mike. Okay, Dan? Thanks, Mohit, for the question. You were a little bit echoey there. I think we got the gist around the patient population for obesity and how to maximize that opportunity. Mike, do you want to take that? I can. And Mike, jump in if I get that wrong. So just to step back on capacity, we did make some comments today related to this. And we've taken actions in the quarter to slow demand internationally on Trulicity, primarily because of the constraints by a competitor, which have shifted demand to Trulicity internationally. Should that happen domestically, of course, that will -- I think we're just trying to give a fair balance to say that, that would be an increase in demand we'd have to manage too as well.  But we are producing above our plans right now. We see that continuing. And the next step-up, Seamus, that we expect in capacity will be North Carolina, which will happen towards the end of next year. Just for clarity, there's actually 2 sites in North Carolina. One we announced in 2020 and one more recently down the road in Concur near Charlotte. That second facility will also come online beginning in '24 with some capacity and really '25 more fully. So the company has taken some pretty aggressive investment steps, and those steps in North Carolina are focused on what we'll call the parental filling and the drug finishing process which is the device that is used for Trulicity, but also Mounjaro.  We take a platform approach. So that device is also used for other Lilly biologics. And gives us flexibility to match supply and demand more agilely. Although Mike's comments were well placed earlier that it's not perfect, like inside of 90 days, we can't perfectly match every skew of demand to every SKU produced. But it does give us a lot of agility. Those 2 sites in North Carolina, I'll point out, I think as Anat said, are huge.  So the first one will literally double our global capacity when it's online, and the second side is a similar size. So we've taken some big CapEx decisions, and it looks well placed given the early uptick in Mounjaro, which looks quite substantial. Those do not speak to the API side. API is a different supply chain. We've also taken actions to expand that capacity. It's currently not the bottleneck and is not expected to be the bottleneck, which is the peptide synthesis process we use.  Of course, big caveat around all this is, of course, things can go wrong. Regulatory approvals are required to bring the new sites online in an on-time fashion, but that's our current outlook. And as Mike said, long term, we're extremely confident we can supply a massive volume of Trulicity and Mounjaro. But these step-ups do take a little bit of time. And should we have a lapse in competitor supply, that will challenge our ability to meet demand. I think that's the main message from today.  As it relates to MCAP, you're right, that beginning in January of '24, for the cap on payments or rebates to Medicaid programs for medications that have a CPI penalty that pushes them above 100% rebate will be lifted, and we will be required to pay states to use our product in that situation. We have not announced our plans to deal with that, although we're formulating plans to deal with that.  And of course, the best thing to do is keep inventing new things, which reset that calculation. And as you know, we've got a Phase III program for weekly insulin and we're progressing efforts on glucose-sensing insulin. We've got, I think, an exciting new approval on Connected Care as well. So all those efforts, I think, are the long-term approach tactically we'll manage through that event at the end of '23, early '24. Thanks, Chris. Okay. For the first question on tirzepatide obesity and the regulatory requirements around 3 and 4, we'll go to Dan, and then we'll go to Jake for the Verzenio San Antonio Breast Conference, maybe preview. Jake, do you want to jump in on Verzenio? Maybe if I could jump on this one because I'm speaking to a lot of analysts, there's a desire to anchor on one event that will then trigger broad commercial access for obesity or not. And I don't really think we think it's going to play out that way that already, there are commercial payers who reimburse medicines for chronic weight management and obesity. It's a small number.  We think as the data accumulates over the course of the balance of the decade that, that will become the norm just like we expect in hypertensive to be paid for. Of course, the big action might relate to Troa and the government coverage in the U.S. or similar efforts ex U.S. And those will be more binary. But I wouldn't encourage investors to think about this sort of waiting for one definitive data set, but rather a more accumulating effect over time where commercial access will slowly open up over the next many years due to both Lilly's efforts and other's efforts to prove the health benefits of chronic weight management. Thanks, Robyn. So Mike, do you want to handle the question on the dosing dynamics? And then with regard to AD and that mind share question, Anne will fill that. Mike? All right. Thanks, Joe, and thanks to the rest of the Lilly team. I appreciate everyone hanging with us on today's call and for your interest in our company. Please follow up with the IR team. If you have any questions that we did not address. Everyone, have a great day. Thanks."

            "name": "Ilya Yuffa",
            "content": "Yes, Steve, thank you for the question. You're right, japan is a critical market. Just to clarify, the $86 million that we recognized for revenue and payment from Mitsubishi Tanabe was for an upfront payment for collaboration which is consistent with partnerships we've had in Japan for a number of our growth brands. Like Trulicity, like Emgality, we've had success in having strategic partnerships with local Japanese companies to successfully commercialize our innovative treatments. We believe that this partnership will allow us to maximize the value of tirzepatide in Japan and Mitsubishi Tanabe does have significant scale and experience in diabetes. And together, we will collaborate. And just to clarify, we will preserve the economics on ongoing economics for the launch and sales of Mounjaro in Japan for [indiscernible]. Yes. Maybe first on Mitsubishi Tanabe and the dynamics of the upfront payment. Basically, the economics are the upfront payment and the future economics would be when we actually start commercializing and selling Mounjaro in Japan market. So that is a onetime upfront payment. And so that's how I would look at the economics for the future. In terms of overall commercialization of Mounjaro outside of the U.S., I think one of the aspects that's important for us to determine is ensuring that whenever we enter a market that we can ensure that we can appropriately supply Mounjaro to type 2 patients in any given market.  And we will evaluate that as well as build up our access. As you may know, for most markets outside the U.S., it takes time and there's typically a lag between approval and also gaining access to patients for reimbursement. And so we don't anticipate that being a significant delay in the full commercialization of Mounjaro outside the U.S., but of course, we will look and monitor and ensure that we have adequate supply when we enter a market."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nKevin Hern: Thank you. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2022 earnings call. Apologies for the hour delay. We had some technical issues on AT&T side. So thanks for your patience. I'm Kevin Hern, Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; and nadashKanazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Scabronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Bilia Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Norden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrick Jansen, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Mike Spring ether, Kenzie and Warren Zirki of the Investor Relations team as well as Joe Fletcher, who will be taking over leadership of the IR team this month. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. We -- additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Ricks: Thanks a lot, Kevin. In Q2, we achieved a number of impactful pipeline milestones, including approval and launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., the FDA submission and acceptance of dononumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line results for lebrikizumab and EU and Japan submissions for mirikizumab. This pipeline progress underscores the breadth and depth of our exciting long-term outlook. Perhaps the headline story for Lilly in the second quarter was the launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., where initial uptake has been strong. We're hearing a great deal of enthusiasm from the field and we're excited about the potential for this new medicine to provide A1c and weight loss benefits to adults living with type 2 diabetes. We remain focused on gaining broad open access for Manzaro and expect the full impact of this medicine for patients and our business to be realized over time as that access is achieved. Turning to Q2 financial results and progress on our strategic deliverables, we saw a relatively flat top line performance in constant currency. As strong volume-driven growth for key products like Verzenio, Jardiance and Trulicity was offset by lower prices as well as for Alimta patent expiry in key markets around the world and last year's sale of Cialis rights in China. Volume for this quarter grew a robust 10%. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sale of Cialis rights in China and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% compared to Q2 2021. In Q2, our newer medicines contributed 18% to volume growth and now account for 67% of our core business revenue which we believe, together with our robust pipeline is the most important indicator of the strength and durability of our growth outlook. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.8% in Q2, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% which includes a negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to acquire in-process R&D and development milestone charges. At our investment community meeting in December, we outlined 5 potential new medicines that could launch over the next 2 years which could serve as catalysts to driving top-tier growth through the decade. There have been important pipeline development since our Q1 earnings call for all 5, including the U.S. approval and launch of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for purtaprutinib in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. -- submissions for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis in the EU and in Japan, positive top line 52-week data for lebrikizumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And we also announced U.S., EU and Japan regulatory approval for Olumiant in alopecia areata. Last month, we announced plans for a $2.1 billion investment in 2 new manufacturing sites here in Indiana to support increasing demand for existing products as well as demand for potential new medicines in our pipeline. This announcement followed Lilly's recent investments in new facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ireland and will further expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities such as genetic medicines. These investments underscore our confidence in the growth of our portfolio in the company. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders in Q2. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates. As previously announced in Q2, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 150,000 doses of beptalizumab for approximately $275 million in an ongoing effort to provide COVID-19 treatment options for patients. Doses of beptalizumab valued at approximately $130 million were shipped in Q2 and the remainder of that order will ship in Q3. Today, we are announcing that in collaboration with the U.S. government, we intend to begin making beptilizumab available for purchase by states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor agreement. This will happen later this month which is prior to the anticipated depletion of the U.S. government's currently available supply. As we move from large ad hoc federal government purchases, the sales and distribution of COVID-19 antibodies to a broader set of purchasers, we will now integrate estimated sales into our forward guidance. As we have said previously, we don't see COVID-19 antibodies as a major long-term driver of growth for the company. Nevertheless, we will continue to do our part where we can to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic with the last monoclonal antibody treatment standing that neutralizes against the Omacron variant.\nOperator: And now I'll turn the call over to Anat, for a more detailed review of our Q2 results.\nA - Anat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We had a few notable items impacting the year-over-year financial comparisons. Foreign exchange rates had roughly 300 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as we saw Q2 revenue declined 4% or 1% on a constant currency basis. In Q2 of 2021, we sold our rights to Cialis in China resulted in $170 million of onetime revenue impact. And this quarter, we also saw the full impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan and have started to see the impact of multiple generic entrants in the U.S. [Operator Instructions]\nA - Dan Skovronsky: To send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox Okay. Nothing has been selected to send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox. I'll continue and hopefully, everyone can hear. Nothing has been selected to send a message to another subscriber under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the stake to enter your own mailbox. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Cialis rights in China last year to send a message to another seroantibody under the area code and phone number of that subscriber or press the start normal... \nA - Anat Ashkenazi: Okay. Hopefully, you heard I will repeat my last intent. So when excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Calistri in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibody total revenue grew 6%, highlighting the solid momentum for our core business in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will accelerate in the second half of the year. Moving on to gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 79.8% in Q2 of 2022. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by product mix and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increase in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation had a modest negative impact on gross margin in Q2. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter which as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, are now inclusive of acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges following guidance from the SEC. -- acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges represented nearly 1,200 basis points of the Q2 OpEx growth. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4%, driven mostly by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of $440 million or $0.46 of EPS primarily related to a charge associated with the buyer of substantially all future obligations that are contingent upon the development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant selective PI3K alpha inhibitor. In Q2 2021, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges were $43 million or $0.04 of EPS. Operating income decreased 32% in Q2, primarily due to higher acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.5% which includes the negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to these charges. Other income and expense was expense of approximately $13 million this quarter compared with income of $5 million in Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 14.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The -- this decrease was driven by favorable tax impact related to the implementation of a provision of the 2017 Tax Act related to the capitalization of R&D expenses, offset by the tax impact of nondeductible development milestones. At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 32% this quarter to $1.25 per share. The most significant driver of the year-over-year decline was the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges which had $0.46 negative impact in Q2 of this year compared to $0.04 in Q2 of last year. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 6%. Excluding revenue from Alimta which declined significantly due to broad generic entry in May and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This volume-driven growth was led by Trulicity, Verzenio and Dorian. We experienced a net price decline of 8% for Q2, driven by lower realized prices for Humalog, ALIMTA and Forteo due to higher rebated segments, making slightly larger portion of the business, higher contracted rates and the list price reduction for insulin lives for injection this year. Lower realized prices for Taltz were also a driver due to the impact of changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, largely driven by favorable adjustment in the base period and to a lesser extent, continued pull-through of existing access. For the first half of 2022, net price decline in the U.S. was 4% and we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline for the full year. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q2 grew 1% in constant currency. Excluding revenue from Alinta which lost exclusivity in June of 2021, revenue grew 12% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, False and Verzenio. For Japan, Q2 revenue decreased 22% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta which both faced generic entry beginning in June 2021. Key growth products represented 69% of total revenue in Japan and grew 11% in Q2 on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue declined 32% in constant currency, driven by the impact of the NRDL formulary access, resulting in lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume for certain newer products, including Verzenio, Tyva, Trulicity and Taltz. We also experienced a price decline for Humalog due to the impact of volume-based procurement. We expect improved access to continue to drive future volume growth more than offsetting the price decline over time. With the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China and to subsequent protective measures intended to control the spread of the virus, we have seen lower volume than we otherwise would have expected in Q2, particularly for infused products. For Tivit, we are also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, primarily driven by increased sales of key growth products. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline in each of the U.S., EU and Japan and a double-digit price decline in China, resulting in a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 20% or nearly 24% in constant currency, generating $4.3 billion in sales and making up 67% of our core business revenue. We continue to see further growth opportunities for these products. For example, we're extremely pleased to see the strong trajectory of Verzenio driven by the adjuvant indication, including recent acceleration in new to brand share of market. In the injectable incretin market, we see significant opportunity for further class growth as these medicines currently make up only 25% of total prescription in the U.S. branded diabetes market and have the prospect of expanding the market through the earlier usage for glucose control and weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Trulicity is experiencing accelerated demand in many international markets due to market growth and the limited availability of competitor GLP in select markets. We are working to meet this increased demand, while also implementing actions in select countries to manage growth and minimize patient impact. This outlook for Trulicity is included in our guidance. Lilly is thrilled to have both Trulicity which has the longest length of therapy of any GLP-1 and Mounjaro which could offer a step change in innovation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic indications as option in this class of medicine. Given the excitement and significant interest with the FDA approval of Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, I'd like to briefly provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing in terms of early launch. After U.S. approval in mid-May, our full scale launch began in mid-June. Our commercial team is prepared, energized and observing a high level of engagement across channels as we roll out a patient-centric approach to launching Monga for patients with type 2 diabetes. The financial results you see from Anjar today reflect significant utilization of samples were accepted and co-pay assistance program to get patients off to a strong start. Pierre negotiations are progressing as expected and we're taking a disciplined approach to establish Monza's access and are focused on delivering the same broad open access which we achieved for Trulicity. As we remain focused on strong execution, we're encouraged by the prescription trends from Mounjaro, including the most recent IQVIA data, shown over 20% share of market for new-to-brand prescriptions in the Type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class. We are also pleased to see that total Lilly-Ntabren share in the type 2 diabetes injectable incurring class has grown nearly 12 percentage points since the launch of Mounjaro. Given the heavy utilization of co-pay cards as we build out access for Mounjaro, prescription trends will likely provide a more accurate measure of launch uptake than net sales over the next few quarters. We are pleased with the initial uptake of Mounjaro which is at the high end of our contemplated scenarios. We do not anticipate supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Mounjaro and we will monitor U.S. uptake to determine the appropriate timing for OUS launches. As a reminder, over the last several years, we have made significant investments to grow our global manufacturing capacity to support Manja volume, including our new RTP side in North Carolina which will come online in 2023. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first half of the year, we invested $4.5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook is unchanged. And -- it now includes an additional $400 million of headwind from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $700 million of FX headwind for the full year compared with our original guidance. This incremental headwind is offset by additional forecasted revenue from our COVID-19 antibody betolizumab which includes $275 million from the U.S. government agreement announced in June of this year as well as estimated revenue from the inception of non-U.S. government distribution that Dave mentioned earlier. As we look ahead, Q3 will mark the first full quarter impact of Alimta U.S. fab Nexi. In addition, Q3 of 2021 revenue benefited from Ilunion COVID-19 sales that will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in the quarter. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged. While the range is unchanged, SG&A does include additional commercial investments for selected key growth products in the second half of the year. Our guidance now include acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of approximately $610 million, reflecting total charges in the first half of the year. We have had no material acquired IP R&D or development milestone charges at this point in Q3 and this guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions in the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 100 basis points to approximately 27% and 29%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact attributable to foreign exchange rates and acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges to date. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $500 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during the second quarter. Our tax rate and EPS in the first half of the year still includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year assumes this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. We -- if this provision is not the further repealed effective this year, then we would expect a reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.34 to now be in the range of $6.96 to $7.11 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.05. The $0.25 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange rates as the impact of EPS of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges for selected -- and selected products are offset by impact of additional sales of baptilozumab. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. Looking across Lilly R&D, I continue to be quite encouraged by the potential we have to turn cutting-edge science into life-changing medicines for patients. This potential is becoming a reality in the late-stage portfolio, where I'll focus my remarks today. But also it's becoming more and more evident in our earlier-stage projects and I look forward to providing updates on some of these assets in future quarters. Given updates we provided at ADA in June, including detailed results from Surmont 1, I'll focus today's R&D update on the late-stage progress since our last earnings call more generally. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 1 and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover both of these slides by therapeutic area. Starting with Immunology; along with our partner, Insight, we're proud that Olumiant has now been approved as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., EU and Japan. Alopecia areata is a significant unmet medical need and we're delighted about what this medicine could mean for people living with this disease. We also announced top line data from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy maintenance studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis which showed 80% of lebrikizumab responders maintained improvements in skin clearance and disease severity at 52 weeks. Data supported both once every 2-week and once every 4-week maintenance dosing with consistent and durable responses. We believe the potential for a once every 4-week maintenance dosing regimen could be an important point of differentiation for patients and healthcare providers. Lilly's planning submission of lebrikizumab to the FDA in 2022, followed by submissions to other regulatory agencies around the world. Almirall has rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is planning for submission to the EMA in 2022. Shifting to mirikizumab. We presented results from the Phase III maintenance study LUCENT-2, at the DDW meeting. This study showed that for patients who responded to treatment on mirikizumab in the 12-week induction period, 50% of patients who received mirikizumab maintenance therapy achieved clinical remission at 1 year compared to 1/4 of patients randomized to placebo. In addition to the U.S. regulatory submission of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis that we announced earlier this year, we have now submitted in the EU and Japan. Also noted here in Immunology is a Phase II start for a BTLA agonist antibody in SLE and our new KB103 inhibitor shown in Phase I. Our IL-2 conjugate is now listed under its nonproprietary name, RespegAltusleukin. Moving to diabetes. We're thrilled that Manjaris now approved in the U.S. is the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We're pleased to have received a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union and we're hopeful for a full approval by the EMA later this quarter. We presented the exciting detailed results from Surmont 1, evaluating truzepatide for treatment of weight management and participants with obesity or overweight at ADA with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. New data included an exploratory analysis that showed roughly 40% of patients achieved at least 25% weight reduction on the 15-milligram dose compared to less than 1% of patients on placebo. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in blood pressure and lipids as well as reduction in fat mass that was nearly 3x greater than that in lean mass. Encouraging data also showed that for those patients who had prediabetes at the start of the study, over 95% returned to normal glucose levels. The efficacy, safety and tolerability data in Surmont 1 exceeded our expectations. Based on our existing robust data set for tirzepatide, we've now engaged with the FDA and we'll have a meeting soon to evaluate whether there's a potential path forward to registration for chronic weight management based on Surmont 1, combined with data from the SURPASS program. We'll continue to communicate to investors as there are material updates. We continue to expand our clinical program for tirzepatide and we've now initiated our Phase III study evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. We also have become -- we also begun a new trial called SURPASS EARLY which evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to standard of care when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetes. Later this year, we'll begin surmount 5, a head-to-head study comparing weight reduction for tirzepatide versus semaglutide 2.4 milligrams. And finally, later this year, we expect to initiate Surmount MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study. Moving to our weekly basal insulin Fc, also known as BIF. We've now initiated a second Phase III trial Q2 which is evaluating BIF compared to DEGLIDEC in adults with type 2 diabetes who are starting basal insulin for the first time. Our Phase II GGG triagonist is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Retitrutide. Also in this area, 2 assets have now entered Phase I clinical development, our dual amylin calcitonin receptor agonist or DACRA and our PNPLA3-SIRNA. In oncology, we are announcing today that the FDA has accepted the filing for partabrutinub in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. Improved treatment options are needed for this challenging disease and we're encouraged that this potential new medicine could be available to patients in early 2023 -- in early phase oncology, we've moved our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor into Phase I development. And finally, moving to neuroscience. We're also pleased to announce the FDA has accepted the filing for genimab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and has granted priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. We continue to look forward to the top line results of the Phase III confirmatory study, Trailblazer ALS 2 by mid-2023 which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. You also noticed we're now referring to N3PG4 by its nonproprietary name Rimtenatak. We plan to initiate the Phase III program for remternatac in the coming weeks. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the second quarter. We're encouraged by the performance of our key growth products which now represent 67% of our core business. We expect to see this grow over time as we work to launch more innovative medicines like Manzaro. Excluding the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges, we expect to see operating margin expansion from both revenue growth and driving further efficiencies in our business. We saw significant progress in our pipeline this quarter with the approvals of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and Illumina in alopecia areata. We also saw progress on our next wave of potential growth catalysts with the FDA acceptance of danonumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line readout for lebrikizumab and additional submissions for mirikizumab. Finally, we returned $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. Looking to the future, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects as we are focused on developing groundbreaking therapies in areas of significant unmet need as well as driving exceptional execution for our recently launched medicines, so they reach patients who need them. Before we close, I'd like to comment as well. This is Kevin Hern last call as Head of our IR team. And before I turn the call over to him to moderate the Q&A session, I'd just like to thank him on behalf of our shareholders, our board and of course, our executive team and employees. He's done an outstanding job for the last 4.5 years, strengthening our relationships with -- the Street as well as being an ambassador to both convey the company's messages to shareholders but also inform management about shareholder perspectives. We wish him the best in his new assignment transitioning to a leadership role in our U.S. commercial group. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kevin for his last Q&A session. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Thanks for the kind words. I will definitely miss it. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so please emit your questions to 2 per caller. Louis [ph], if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: Just have 2 quick ones. One on Mounjaro. I know it's pretty early in adoption but maybe just talk about the source of new starts, meaning are they GLP naive or experience? And then talk about the expected payer dynamics looking to 2023 -- and for Dan on tirzepatide, I know your regulatory discussions are ongoing in obesity but do you think you can also use the safety database from diabetes and other indications when you look to kind of NASH, sleep apnea, et cetera. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Geoff. We'll start off with Mike on Lazaro. And then Dan, if you want to comment on the regulatory for trispeidesaD. Mike?\nMike Mason: Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the question. What we've seen -- first of all, we're incredibly excited about the very robust launch we've had with Manzaro. We're also excited about the source of business that we're seeing. 72% of Monday's is coming from new patients into the entrain class. We think that's very important for accelerating class growth and we have seen class growth both at total prescriptions, new-to-brand and NTS accelerate since BonCharles launch. Of the 28% of the volume that's coming from switches, only 30% of that is from Trulicity and 70% is from other GLPs. And so as a result, as Anat indicated earlier, we're actually seeing Lilly incretin share market growing which is the sign that we -- of a robust solid foundation that we're laying. And so the NBRx have increased our share by the Lilly share in the injectable market by 12% and new to treatment starts by 10%. So we're very happy. We're growing the class and the market share at the same time. Your second question around payer dynamics, it's going as expected for us. We're trying to stay very disciplined. I think our focus is to set ourselves up for long-term success, not short-term success. -- and that's what we're doing. So it's going as expected. So far, we have both commercial and Part D access on Express Scripts, Cigna and Humana formularies. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Dan?\nA \u2013 Dave Ricks: Yes. Thanks, Geoff, for the question. You\u2019re pointing out that correctly that we intend to pursue a number of related indications for tirzepatide. Some of them have overlapping patient populations. Most of the indications we pursue have a base of patients that either have obesity as a pre-existing and sometimes causative condition such as obstructive sleep apnea or heart failure in people with obesity, other indications might be a mix of type 2 diabetes and obesity representing a large number of patients such as NASH. So where applicable safety exposures from similar proposition can be used to support submissions. Of course, some of those programs are staggered in time. And so by the time we get efficacy data of those indications, we\u2019ll also have quite likely the rest of the Samat [ph] program. But where we are today is quite a large and robust safety database from the entire COBAS program as well as SME.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan, Jeff.\nOperator: The next caller is Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChris Schott: Just two for me. I guess just on the obesity opportunity. I guess, basin the feedback you've been getting on that surmountidata, I guess is there any change in terms of how you anticipate payers will approach obesity? I guess the heart of the question is, do you anticipate we're going to really need to see some of the CV morbidity mortality data before we can think about broad coverage for obesity medications? Or are you seeing payers potentially more interested in covering these type of products given some of the profile that kind of emerged from that study? My second question was one for Dave. I guess, on just in healthcare reform. I know you love answering these questions. But I guess, as you guys just been so involved in this process. So just appreciate your thoughts on the latest bill we\u2019re seeing and just kind of the impact you\u2019d expect it to have in the industry and maybe a little more specifically. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We'll go to Mike first and then on obesity, then Dave for healthcare reform.\nMike Mason: Yes, great question. The SURMOUNT 1 data was phenomenal data for patients and physicians who treat obesity. We -- I think there's a combination of effects that will affect employers and the government to increase access for obesity agents. One is the data we produce. And I think, obviously, the first data we're producing is the weight loss as well as the factors like lipids and blood pressure. And the data we produce so far has been stellar. So I think the better data we produce and Surmont 1 through SMA4 is just going to help us in the short term. Long term, we think there's a lot of comorbid conditions associated with obesity like CV and heart failure and sleep Pactia and the better data we support there will open up those indications where are highly have a lot of overlap with obesity. And so we're excited about those trials and seeing those data as those trials complete. And then lastly, the more we can drive consumer interest in this, that puts pressure on employers and the government to be able to gain access for this. And so I think we've got strong plans on all 3 fronts and we're excited about the first data disclosure we've had on obesity. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects of the obesity market and rolling it. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Dave? \nDave Ricks: Yes Chris, thanks for the question. I think everybody probably on the call has a good grasp of what's in this package, Difficult to speculate on probabilities but certainly a lot higher than a month ago that something crosses the line. There may be some adjustments to this as they go through that parliamentary process and whatever changes might occur or still to come in the center in the house. But if what we're looking at passes, maybe that's your question, as you know, we've been for the Part D forms, I think they're good incremental changes, particularly capping annual out-of-pocket and getting rid of the donut hole concept. Unfortunately, they don't improve the concept of facing patient cost sharing on net pricing which we were hoping it would. But by itself, we would support that. The CPI adjustment is not really an issue as probably everyone on this call knows, there's already lots of CPI capping that goes on in the commercial marketplace. And with CPI being where it is now as well. I think list prices in the drug business are not nearly as fast as the rest of the economy. But the negotiation piece is a problem. And I think in the short term, speaking for our company but probably the industry, it doesn't do much. They don't really start until '26 anyway. But in the midterm, there will be, of course, some products that will have attenuated life cycles. And I think that will cause some headwinds for the industry and we'll see if any Lilly products get caught up in that. But probably, to me, the most damaging thing about it is it sends a signal to investors and capital allocators like us that small molecules and particularly small molecules in diseases that require stepwise development like cancer, where we start in stage at later stages and work our way to adjuvant or even in some orphan conditions really aren't wanted and are worth a lot less. So, we'll focus our resources on other areas of innovation. We've got plenty of those. And so will the rest of the sector. And I think that's really a miss for the patients that probably want better oral cancer drugs in the future and orphan disease drugs. So I think that's probably not being talked about enough and I just wanted to emphasize that. \nOperator: The next call is Fernandez from Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. So just a couple of questions here. Dave, I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on the comment that you made there with regard to orals, how do you see that impacting your efforts to bring forward oral diabetes drugs? And is it more a benefit to complex oral therapies that aren't small molecule per se but perhaps a more peptide oriented. I know you guys are working on some efforts along those lines. So just interested to know if the legislation would imply that as well from a small molecule perspective, we see a number of oral GLP-1s seeking to come to market. at some point in time? And then separately, just on Dan, on the glucagon mechanism, I see BBG listed in 2 Phase II clinical trials but mazetide, your Axos modulin product is listed just in sort of the Phase 1 in diabetes. Wondering if you guys have officially made a decision to move forward with BG or if mazetide is still potentially in the mix as kind of your next-gen asset in the obesity space. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We'll go to Dave and then Dan.\nDave Ricks: Yes. Thanks, James. I mean, I guess, put a finer point on it. Each project will have to be evaluated one by one. But I think you will probably see 10 years down the line, fewer small molecule oral products developed in the industry than would have been otherwise the case if this bill passes. -- again, that to me is the miss. And I think it -- there's still probably quite a bit of advantage in oral small molecules in sort of large primary care indications, especially if in the case of like GLP, we could accept that weight loss will provide broader benefits for the earlier question about when sort of the belief system tips over and people just accept that chronic weight management could for health like reduced blood pressure is good for cardiovascular risk. And I think those products will be evaluated one by one and big opportunities, I think, will advance and do well. They'll have attenuated life cycle in the government business and that will have to be factored in but we'll look at that. What I was referring to is more, I think, in narrower revenue opportunities, it just gets a lot harder. And when -- by kind of construct, your new indications can't be compressed forward because of the way we develop drugs in some of these diseases, that's a problem. And I don't think that was well thought through and there will be a long-term implication to that. One other thing I probably should say is this bill raises $300 billion for the federal government off the back of the industry, probably cost the industry at least $0.5 trillion and only about $50 billion of that, like 10% is going back to patient benefit support. And I think that's another tenant when we were leading pharma literally was to make sure whatever came out of the industry went back to patients. That's not happening here and that needs to be discussed as well. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. Dan? \nDave Ricks: Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question on our glucagon containing molecules. We previously said that we have 2 in clinical development, mazdutide which is our oxyntomodulin that's glucagon plus GLP-1 and retitrutide which is our ABG which is glucagon GLP-1 and GIP 1. You're right that the ACG molecule is a head and development that's in Phase II and the oxyntomodulin is still in Phase I. I think they're both viable as next-generation weight loss products. But to be clear here, it's a very high borrower looking for a major step change above the really remarkable results we saw in Surmont One. I think they both have that potential but we're going to need to see more data to know which it either goes forward to Phase II. -- just like when we're doing Phase II interzepatide which was just a few years ago, we noted that it had to have a step change to go forward to Phase III. If you hear us talk about when or growth of these molecules going to Phase III, it means we saw that kind of a big step change.\nKevin Hern: Thanks.\nOperator: The next caller is Louise Chen with Cantor.\nLouise Chen: So my first question for you was on the obesity product. Do you see any potential read-throughs from NOVO SELECT study to tazepatide? And have you given any color on how you want to structure your studies on an outcome basis for BC? And then secondly, it's been quiet on the Alzheimer's front but just curious if you have any updated thoughts on the market opportunity for demenumab, especially in front of some of these Phase III trials will read out at the end of the year. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Louise. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the question on the SELECT trial and then Anne for the question on Alzheimer\u2019s. \nDan Skovronsky: Louise, thanks for that question. Of course, we always reach for our competitors' success on clinical trials. We want great data so that we can have great drugs to help patients. I think the novo they pass the interim analysis but didn't stop the trial for efficacy is fine. I think there's really pretty significant differences here between tirzepatide and semaglutide that we just have to remember, a different mechanism, a different degree of efficacy on various outcomes, different trial designs, different populations to some extent. So we don't change our design of our SURMOUNT MMO study. We don't change our thinking about probably success. As Mike said earlier, we're highly confident in this mechanism. -- based on all of the data that we've seen, of course, starting with a quite dramatic weight loss which should be a benefit on morbidity and mortality from obesity. But also all of the cardiovascular indicators that we reported out in that Phase III study, including a very significant drop in blood pressure that should have a benefit -- a drop in LDL, an increase in HDL a drop in triglycerides, all of that should contribute to cardiovascular outcomes. So we remain excited and confident about our own study going forward. \nLouise Chen: Thanks, Dan.\nDan Skovronsky: Louise, thanks for the question on Alzheimer's. So the fact is bottom line is we remain convinced about the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab and the Alzheimer's portfolio. Our focus right now is obviously on the rapid availability of donanemab for the appropriate patients through the accelerated approval pathway and then reconsideration with Phase III data. And we remain optimistic that with -- particularly with traditional FDA approval, FDA -- or sorry, CMS would not continue to limit coverage for on-label treatments. Now obviously, you mentioned competitor readout. As we've noted on prior calls, there is a chance that we'll see mixed results in some of these readouts due to the differences in the medicines and their trial designs. And as you know well, we have some unique design features in TV2 and a medicine that demonstrates rapid and deep plaqclearance. So we won't be discouraged if others miss their primary endpoints. And so we'll be following that closely, obviously. But in the near term, of course, we have to acknowledge that patient access will be very limited under the current CMS and CD with accelerated approval. But what that does do with the accelerated approval is really enable us to engage quickly with CMS following that Phase III data and hopefully drive reconsideration at that point. And it also allows us to accelerate the traditional approval through a supplemental BLA. So what we'll do in the near term, following a potential approval and the accelerated pathway is use that time to build out the diagnostic ecosystem to help physicians with the referral process and infusion systems. And so there's quite a bit to do, I think, to get ready for that Phase III data.\nOperator: The next call is Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Two for me. I guess, Mike, you talked about aiming for long-term success with Manzaro from a reimbursement perspective. So can you just maybe define that for us, put a finer point on it? Should we assume that means you're aiming for a net price above Trulicity ultimately over time? And then as we think about your ability to supply the market here, obviously, launch, you said at the high end of your expectations. No, I think you touched on this a little bit during your comments in terms of confidence in U.S. supply. But how are you thinking about the broader supply dynamics globally and then remind us your flexibility to increase supply, if needed over time. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Terence. We'll go to mic for both questions on Manzaro, with access and price and then just global supply outlook. \nMike Mason: Okay. Thanks, Terrence, for those questions. Long term, I think our goals there is obviously to optimize our net price but also secure broad access like we have for Trulicity. So those are our 2 goals. Obviously, we don't give specifics on our net price negotiations publicly. But we're pleased with the progress. We're staying disciplined, trying to accelerate access before any new product launch. You got to be careful that you're not too aggressive, you get access to early but you pay too much for it. So we're staying disciplined. We've got a great product with a great profile. Payers are seeing that but it's a process and we're going through that process right now. From a supply perspective, Mongeral, as Anat said, we were planning for success. And so we had a lot of different launch scenarios. And we have lot scenarios that considered this level of uptake. As Anat shared, we don't anticipate any supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Manzaro. We -- our manufacturing team has been working around the clock for years to build manufacturing capacity throughout the supply chain. We have a number of sites who make this and they're optimizing our initial capacity on a daily basis. Also, we have made investments to expand our capacity over the next several years. We have a new parental plant at Research Dragon Park in North Carolina that's coming online in 2023 and another one behind that in Concord, North Carolina. Also, we're building 2 manufacturing facilities to make taconigredient for Mongeral and those will come on at a later time. So obviously, we're planning for success. And -- our manufacturing team is working around the clock to get as much of past supply as possible. \nTerence Flynn: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Next call is Tim Anderson with Research [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: On the outcomes trial for obesity, presumably, that's a cardiovascular outcomes trial with MACE was a primary endpoint? And if so, what level of benefit will it be powered to show? Novo is designed to show 17%. And then on the head-to-head versus Novo's product in obesity, anything you can see on trial design, specifically primary endpoint and perhaps, most importantly, the timing of having results... \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Tim. We\u2019ll go to Dan for the first question on Surmount MMO and then Mike for the second question on the head-to-head trial with Novo for Costa. \nDave Ricks: Yes. Thanks for that question, Tim. You're raising an interesting point. I think implicit in your question is the observation that there's a lot of health benefits that come from losing weight Obesity is a risk factor for a number of things, not just the things that are traditionally measured in cardiovascular outcome studies or MACE studies. So probably also noting, we've called this morbidity mortality outcomes, MMO in obesity rather than CVOT. But beyond that, I think we've intentionally not gotten into details on the primary endpoint or the powering assumption. So that is yet to be disclosed. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Mike? \nMike Mason: Yes. On the head-to-head versus sema 2.4 milligram, there's been no head-to-head trials comparing receppatide to sema 2.4. So we believe there was a good opportunity to do that to demonstrate tirzepatide significant weight loss benefits and totality, the benefits it has for patients. Head-to-head studies are the gold standards. Every time we talk to healthcare professionals, they really value and get a lot out of head-to-head studies. It just really informs their treatment. So we think it's the right thing to do and we're pleased to do that. It's going to be a head-to-head study, where we're comparing tuxepatide versus 72.4 in people that have obesity and overweight with the weight-related core mobility. Other than that, we'll provide more on the design and the time line at the later date as we get closer to posting it on clinicaltrials.gov. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Tim, thanks.\nOperator: The next call is Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala: A couple of questions. First, Lilly mentioned in the prepared remarks, a limited availability of competitor GLP-1s in select geographies. Can you be more specific on which geographies and the magnitude of the issue? And then a question for Dan. You must have been on the receiving end of many calls from DSMBs with interim updates on trials. For example, the trial of Trulicity in cardiovascular outcomes REWIND. The question is, what is the depth of the information exchange between DSMBs and sponsors at that time? For instance, if a study is continuing past an interim look, is the conversation only 3 words, study is continuing? Or is it more expensive? Or does it depend? And if it depends, what does it depend on? It would seem to me at least, counterproductive for DSMB not to provide some guidance just from the vantage point of further development of the molecule. So that's my question. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We're going to go to Ilya for the question on the supply and demand that we're seeing for Trulicity outside the U.S. and then we'll go to Dan for the second question. Ilya?\nIlya Yuffa: Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. First, what we've seen is an accelerated demand for Trulicity in many of our international markets and there's probably 3 sources of that one, great commercial success. We've been really successful in our diabetes portfolio in driving the growth and utilization of Trulicity. At the same time, we've seen accelerated market growth. And we have seen in some select markets, the amplified demand for Trulicity because semaglutide is not available in full extent in a number of markets. In terms of where we've seen volatility in where that is occurring. And so we're evaluating the local situation is quite dynamic and we're ramping up as much as we can to need this amplified demand. At the same time, in some of these markets, we're going to have to look at managing some of the growth and making sure we limit any kind of patient impact. \nSteve Scala: Thanks, Ilya.\nKevin Hern: Dan?\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks,. I understand where your question is going and we probably don't weigh in specifically on what others might do or see but I'll tell you how we run DSMBs and how we think about them generally across the industry. There's a couple of principles at play here. First, of course, is independence. This is not something run by the sponsor. And I think that's an important consideration for patient safety. We don't see the data they see and we're not privy to the discussions as a rule. The second is that we do set for DSMB's rules in advance by which they should make decisions. Those could be very simple rules in some cases, like hit statistical significance with a certain alpha on the primary endpoint or they could be more complex rules looking for consistency across secondaries or subpopulations or a higher bar of efficacy on the primary so that you're sure that you have a compelling effect that varies from study study and sponsor to sponsor. I'm sure. The third thing is that the recommendations that DSMBs get back to sponsors are often prespecified. So we'll tell the DSMB if it meets these criteria. This is what you tell us. And if it doesn't, this is what you tell us. And they usually are a matter of fact, without color that could compromise the integrity or cause one unblinding of an ongoing study. So I hope that's helpful in understanding how DSMBs work. I think at many companies, if there is a surprising recommendation for the DSMB such as to stop a study, there will often be a process where the sponsor or 1 or 2 representatives of the sponsor are unblinded so they can confirm the DSMB conclusion before taking action. But that wouldn't be typical for a simple study continuous kind of decision. \nDave Ricks: Thanks, Dan. \nKevin Hern: Steve, thanks for your questions. \nOperator: Next caller is Umar Raffat from Evercore -- to Andrew Baum from Citigroup.\nAndrew Baum: A couple of questions. First on Wingo. -- you uniquely have labeling requiring second form of contraception during titration which Gobi had. The recent Supreme Court overturning of row versus weight put increased emphasis on the confidence in terms of risk of pregnancy given the consequences. How are you thinking about this, whether it's potentially an acute for the product, whether through additional pharmacology studies that could be overturned as the obesity indication rolled through. It does seem from the FDA review that there's a real pharmacologic concern rather than the forcedata here? And then second, on the positive side in relation to the pursuit filing, assuming you get approval on commence cells. I\u2019m assuming that you would, therefore, get inclusion in the MCN NCCN guidelines for Brewing for CLL. So could you talk to how you think the expedited approval through mantle cell may accelerate your penetration of the CLL market when you\u2019re waiting for the Phase I trial program mature\u2026 \nKevin Hern: Thanks andrew. We'll go to Mike for the first question on Mondoro labeling and the social climate and then we'll go to Jake for the question on prtibrutinib. \nMike Mason: Thanks andrew. I appreciate the question. Let me just even said everyone, our label on Mongeral advisers women using contract oral contraception to switch to or add to a non-oral contraceptive methods for 4 weeks during initiation of the product and then during the dose titration for each dose. Given the -- so healthcare professionals are aware of this, given the profound benefits of Mongeral, this hasn't impacted at all HCP and consumer interest in Montara. If you look at the data in the marketplace, we have data with ONKVIA through July 22 which is just 5 weeks of full promotion. And we've -- and Mounjaro already reached 20% new brand share market. So we haven't seen this as an issue at all. As to the future works for and evaluating the issue, we have nothing new to report to investors at this time. But this has not been an issue that has impacted Montara's uptake at all. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Jay?\nJake Van Naarden: So just as a matter of policy, we submit company sponsored guideline requests on consistent with labeling indications that we actually intend to receive or expect to receive. So we'll do that in this setting as well in the context of BTK pretreated relapsed/refractory metal cell lymphoma. What that -- from there, the NCCN and other guideline process is completely independent and has no involvement from us whatsoever to the extent that they choose to do something beyond our labeled indication is really completely out of our hands and hard for me to speculate on -- and of course, we'll be promoting the product only on the labeled indication that we received. \nAndrew Baum: Thanks, Jake. \nKevin Hern: Andrew, thanks for your questions.\nOperator: The next caller is David Risinger [ph] from SVB Securities.\nUnidentified Analyst: So my questions relate to Manzaro, please. First, could you clarify the share gain percentages. So I believe the comment was that Lilly\u2019s combined Trulicity and Manzaro share gained by 12 percentage points. So I wanted to just understand what was the starting point and where is the figure today? And then there was also a comment about new to treatment starts gaining by 10%. So if you could provide the X to Y on that. And then based upon your current view of the very strong U.S. uptake of the product, to what degree is Lilly planning to gate its ex U.S. Munzara launches due to the manufacturing supply constraints that you\u2019re currently up against? \nKevin Hern: Thanks, David. We'll go to Mike for the questions around share gain and then Ilya for the questions around OUS launch. \nMike Mason: Okay Dave, thanks. I'll give you more context of the percentages that we had earlier on in the call. So what we're looking at is IQVIA data, the beginning of that by our analysis is June 3. We had our launch meeting the week after ADA, so the week of June 14 and -- so we have been promoting kind of full on since then. And so when you compare where we're at today, this is -- we have IQVA data through July 22, so 5 weeks of promotion. So we're comparing the -- our NBRx volume, our new-to-brand volume and share at July 22 versus June 13 in the injectable anchor gen market. And so what we've seen since then is that Montero's NBRx share has reached 20.5%. We saw Trulicity's NBRx has declined by only 8.4 share points. And so that produces a net gain in the Lilly injected NBRx share of 12.2%. And -- and then with NTS same time period, same market, we have a 10% overall Lilly injectable NBR share gain. \nKevin Hern: Yes. David, thanks for your question on the launch of Manzaro outside of the U.S. and our thoughts around that. One of the key aspects of how we take a look at launching outside the U.S. It's typical for most product launches across pretty much all therapeutic areas to have some lag to U.S. launches, either through -- because of regulatory approval and process but also pricing and reimbursement -- and it can take up to a year to get reimbursement in a number of markets. So the volumes in that first year of launch are somewhat limited. We are encouraged by what we're seeing in the U.S. launch of Manzaro and looking forward to launching Anjar outside of the U.S. and leveraging our commercial expertise and strength in diabetes across our markets outside the U.S. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Sylia. David, thanks for your calls. \nDave Ricks: Maybe just -- David, just to clarify that, because the way you framed your question, you said we're up against supply constraints. In the case of Major, as we said today in the prepared text, we don't anticipate supply constraints in the U.S. Of course, before introducing a product in a new market, we want to make sure we could fully initiate new patients and supply. And based on our competitors' actions, it's hard to predict a year from now what we'll need in a given market. So it's not that we don't have supply. It's more -- the demand picture is unstable. We want to -- we're just cautioning that we want to know that before we initiated a launch sequence. But we've launched in the U.S. and we're committed to that supply. It's not that we have an issue, just to be clear. \nOperator: The next call is Chris [ph] from Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Two questions. The first one, thank you for that information about the relative trend as far as where the source of patients were narrowing in on the question of what portion were actually switches from Trulicity that was helpful back of the envelope that sounded like about 10%. Is that about what you expected? And where do you think that this will go? I'm asking, obviously, since we're relatively early stages of this launch. Second question would be about Verzenio, actually to bring up something that seems a little bit less focused upon but performance has been strong and logically would seem to be in the adjuvant setting. But could you speak to what you believe is driving this and what the outlook is for those trends that have thus far been delivering the strong performance there? \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We\u2019ll go to Mike for the question of Maguro and then Jake for the question on Verzenio. \nMike Mason: Yes, it's a good question. I think we're getting what we expected we thought we would see more new patients into the class. That's who we talk about with healthcare professionals and that's what we're getting. So we're not surprised by that, pretty typical what we'd expect with the new GLP launch. Now what you would expect when you have a new product like Monger especially with endocrinologists that they don't always see naive patients. They have a good bolus of patients who are already on GLPs. And so when they -- when we talked to them about Montero, they're excited about the opportunity to actually switch some of the patients who are not performing or not at goal at the current GLP. And so I think early on, you'll see like a higher percent coming from switches versus naive. And so today, we have 72% that is naive. If you look at at Trulicity, that's in like 88%. So what I would expect is that, that percentage coming from AE will grow over time. But I think this is what we would expect at launch and we're very pleased by both Trulicity and Darryl's performance since Mangerahas launched. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Jay. Yes, thanks for the question on Verzenio. We too are pleased with how this has gone so far this year. I think to your question on why and where it goes from here. On the why, I think it largely comes down to the clinical data from the MONARCHY study itself. I think the data are demonstrable and when physicians and patients see them, they quickly want to integrate the drug into their practice. Now in addition to that and this is something we hoped would see happen, we think we're seeing some share gains in the metastatic setting as well, particularly among physicians who historically used other CDK4/6 inhibitors are gaining experience with Verzenio by utilizing it in the adjuvant setting and then starting to use it in the metastatic setting where perhaps they hadn't been before. So that was part of what we hoped might happen. I think we're seeing that happen a little bit so far this year. That having been said, in terms of where we go from here, I'll just say 2 things. One, we continue to interact with physicians who are still not yet aware of the MONARCHY data. And so that's, of course, good and bad. It's bad because there are patients who are appropriate for the medicine that should be on it. It's -- but it is opportunity to continue growing in the labeled indication that we have currently -- and on that note, as we've talked about in the past, we're hopeful that we have the opportunity to expand the indication to the enrolled trial population for MONARCH and we're awaiting that analysis of overall survival, as we talked about in the past. So yes, we're pleased with how it's going. We see plenty of opportunity ahead to continue the momentum. \nKevin Hern: Chris, thanks for your questions.\nOperator: Next call is Carna Gold from Barclays.\nDave Ricks: I guess, first off, can you talk about how pronounced the cash pay component was of the early kind of Majoro number? And then how you expect maybe that to evolve? And then separately, maybe coming back to the drug pricing question but from a different angle, it would appear that Lilly could be one of the main beneficiaries from lower out-of-pocket costs on that side and you think about sort of improvement in compliance. So can you maybe help frame that impact or maybe think about how compliance today differs in the U.S. versus maybe other markets where those out-of-pocket costs or not it can don\u2019t exist? \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Carter. Mike, for the first question. I'm on Dave [ph] for the follow-up on the drug pricing reform and the impact. \nMike Mason: Carter, thanks for the question. On the cash pay side, we expect the percent of cash paid to follow our percent access in the marketplace. What we've seen so far, again, I reiterate what I said earlier, that we have both Part D and commercial access for Humana, Express Scripts on the National Preferred Formulary and Cigna. If you add that up, that's a little over 20% of the national lives. And so I think that's probably the best estimation of what you probably see with the cash pay. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Mike. Dave \u2026\nDave Ricks: Yes. Carter, I think you're pointing out something as I mentioned, we would be supportive as a freestanding measure of the Part D reforms that are in this reconciliation package for a bunch of reasons. One, it does, I think, more fairly distribute the burden of the industry pay for into Part D. Today, the way the donut hole math works, if you go back a couple of years, we had a lot of earnings calls, we had to describe that. There's this really disproportionate contribution from the industry inside the donut hole. So commonly used medications like in diabetes and cardiovascular, have a pretty big hit on that. That gets smoothed out. So now that drugs that hit the catastrophic pay more and it's more of a balanced contribution independent of drug type, that's a good thing for companies like Lilly, that have more commonly used drugs. The other thing though you're pointing out and I think this really would affect a product like Verzenio for us primarily is patients who get thrown into the catastrophic have this uncapped 5% contribution today. And we know that not only do patients discontinue and you mentioned about compliance rates which are better in oral oncology in Europe than the U.S., for instance. But I think also you'll see more initiation because physicians and their families screen themselves out of even qualifying for an appropriate medication for themselves because of financial burden and maybe go to chemotherapy instead of a more targeted therapy. So that presents another way in which we can both improve healthcare in America but also prospects for medicines at Lilly max. So those are good things. As I said, on balance, we still don't like it for the negotiation side but those are positive elements. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: The next call is Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: To please. Firstly, on price, you\u2019ve clearly cited low realized prices for a number of drugs this quarter, particularly in the U.S. And I\u2019m wondering if you can speak specifically to how that\u2019s evolving in the GLP-1 market. Any particular step-up on Trulicity rebates since the Manzaro launch. What are your expectations here going forward? Is it a trend is higher rebates and negative channel mix noted by your competitor on the eosyesterday. So interested to get in the meal perspective here? And then a quick question for Anat. When do you anticipate having greater clarity on the possible repeal in the 2017 tax\u2026 \nKevin Hern: Great. Thanks, Gary. We'll go to Mike for the question on anchored and market price trends and then not for the question on tax reform... \nKerry Holford: Mike?\nMike Mason: Yes. That's a good question. I think naturally, payers will ask for additional rebates when a new product joins a formulary. So as part of our discussion of being disciplined and why you don't want to accelerate those discussions too rapidly and that's a factor into it. So I think net-net, I don't expect any step changes in GLP pricing as a result of Montero launching but it is part of the national pressure intention and contract negotiations. \nKerry Holford: Thanks, Mike. Anat?\nAnat Ashkenazi: So on taxes, what we are seeing is we're seeing broad bipartisan support for appealing that change of capitalizing R&D expenses. -- was evident in the recent Senate letter. This could come. We believe it will come through by the end of this year, most likely if I had to guess, I would say, towards the end of the year, potentially as part of a tech tender. \nKerry Holford: Thanks, Anat. \nOperator: The next call is Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nDave Ricks: Maybe one question on the SELECT-EARLY study, the diabetic study. So maybe one for you, Dan. What you really need to show how long the trial and what you need to show in terms of delta versus control to be -- to prove that it is beneficial in prediabetic patients. And wouldn't oral JLP a better drug for those patients \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mo. So Dan, the question on SURPASS early, the prediabetes study and then whether oral GLP would be better there. \nDave Ricks: Yes. That's an early diabetes study. But I think you're -- I don't believe we've disclosed the design of the endpoints yet. But I think with respect to diabetes prevention, that's certainly a very interesting area. And there are currently FDA guidance on what's required to show diabetes prevention of diabetes to get that kind of claim. It's a very high bar. And I suspect the field will come to an understanding about which drugs can actually decrease the risk of getting diabetes you can prevent diabetes before any drug is able to get that indication. I think this class of medications, particularly tirzepatide has great promise in that area. We highlighted the data from Sumant that showed the vast majority, more than 95% of people were prediabetic at the beginning of the study had normal glucose levels at the end of the study. That's really promising. -- longer-term data, including drug washout data required to get to that kind of claim.\nMike Mason: Yes, I can add a few comments on that. This study is for people with diabetes have been diagnosed with diabetes. And we want to test what the impact could be on the progression of diabetes if you put a product like tirzepatide on very early in the course of treatment. And so this will study putting \u2013 starting patients who are na\u00efve or very early in their treatment versus standard of care. We think weight loss with the benefits of a GLP and GIP and the improvement in beta cell function and insulin sensitivity could have a profound impact of disrupting type 2 diabetes. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re testing in the study. It\u2019s one that we\u2019re very excited about. And we\u2019ve already started to see weekly injectables being used earlier than just the injection space as more people understand that a weekly injection through an auto injector is a good experience and actually some some consumers prefer orals but some actually consume prefer a weekly injection with an auto injector like Monaro and Trulicity has. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. \nOperator: The next caller is Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.\nDave Ricks: So as part of the FDA acceptance of your accelerated approval filing for donanemab, have you gotten clarity from the agency if the iADRS scale is acceptable as an acceptable endpoint for full approval? And can you also talk about what you saw with the N3 PG4 to move it into Phase III? \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Evan. We\u2019ll go to Dan for those. \nDave Ricks: Yes. Thanks for the 2 Alzheimer's questions. So first one is on the accelerated approval application for genenimab and whether that's an opportunity to gain more insight about acceptability of iADRS which is our primary endpoint in the Phase III study. It may not be an opportunity actually because the accelerated approval is not contingent on an understanding of the cognitive or functional benefits of denetumab which we saw in the Phase II trial. Instead, the accelerated approval is just simply contingent on a demonstration of lowering amyloid levels. So I'm not sure we'll get into a deep discussion of that, although clearly, it's relevant in terms of the confirmatory study, Trailblazer 2. The second question that you raised was with respect to remternatug, the NTBG4molecule. This is a next-generation antiplaqueor plaque-removing antibody designed to attack the same power glutamate residue that donanemab goes after. We\u2019ve seen robust ability of this molecule to clear plaques in patients. Remember that a liability or potential liability of genitimab is antidrug antibodies. And so we\u2019ve also noted that this molecule doesn\u2019t have that issue. So given the potent robust clearance of plaques combined with lack of ADAs, we think this is amenable to alternative dosage forms that could be more convenient to patients. So we\u2019ll be looking at that. \nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. \nOperator: The next caller is Robin Kinesis with Tuas Securities.\nOperator: The next caller is Colin Bristow with UBS.\nDave Ricks: And Kevin, thanks for all the great work. On business development, we had 2 deals announced today. Can you just give us your updated thoughts on BD areas of interest, deal size? And then just what your -- what's the view that you're getting from potential targets on their willingness to transact given the market backdrop? And then secondly, just on donanemab, what's your latest thinking? Or have you had any interactions with CMS with regards to how a single successful Phase III trial would be viewed in the context of reimbursement? \nKevin Hern: Thank you. I'll invite not to weigh in on the BD question and then Anne for the donanemab question. \nColin Bristow: So on the business development side and in terms of areas of interest and what we're seeing in the marketplace, given some recent changes in valuation, our areas of interest remain really unchanged from what we've had the last several quarters which is our core therapeutic areas. So looking at potential breakthrough innovations in those areas in different stages of preclinical and clinical development as well as in areas of new modalities where we talked about expansions that we have in those areas. We do look at and what you've seen us do in the last 12, 18 months is more earlier stage opportunities where we can bring things into our pipeline to supplement our existing portfolio and add value as well as innovation in our core areas. Valuations will have changed in the last 6 months or so has not historically been the rate-limiting factor in terms of pursuing business develop opportunities. It's really finding those breakthrough opportunities where we make those investments. And you asked about kind of target engagement and whether or not those views have changed, we're looking at whether we look at a partnership or acquisition, everyone wants to get to value if the opportunity is there, then we tend to be able to get to a good spot. \nKevin Hern: Thanks for the question on donanemab. So it's our belief that the data package for donanemab which includes, obviously, both Trailblazzer all and all I should be sufficient to meet with CMS as described as that high level of evidence in CD. So the Trailblazer all study obviously was the first disease-modifying Alzheimer's trial to successfully meet its primary endpoint. And if Charles all 2 also delivers that direct evidence of clinical benefit as we expect it would, then we'll engage with CMS to discuss that path quickly and broadly expand access to the treatment. And we have been engaging with CMS throughout the process and we'll continue to do so moving forward. And they've shown openness to continue to meet. Obviously, they noted in the NCD, the promise of donanemab and they've shown a great deal of interest in understanding the Trailblazer 2 Phase III program. And so I think we'll have more clarity on the timing of reconsideration. We're able to share that data with them in mid- they've stated publicly they're committed to rapid reconsideration that I think we'll have to update you on timing once they have that data in hand, mine next year and we discuss next steps with them. Colin, thanks for your questions. We've exhausted the queue. Dave, for the close. \nDave Ricks: Okay, great. Thanks for joining us today. And I just want to apologize for all the technical challenges on the call, we'll get that cleaned up. We do appreciate you participating today and your interest in our company. And please follow up with our IR team, including Joe Fletcher, our new leader. And if you have questions we have not addressed today on the call. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service.",

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Kevin. In Q2, we achieved a number of impactful pipeline milestones, including approval and launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., the FDA submission and acceptance of dononumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line results for lebrikizumab and EU and Japan submissions for mirikizumab. This pipeline progress underscores the breadth and depth of our exciting long-term outlook. Perhaps the headline story for Lilly in the second quarter was the launch of Mounjaro in the U.S., where initial uptake has been strong. We're hearing a great deal of enthusiasm from the field and we're excited about the potential for this new medicine to provide A1c and weight loss benefits to adults living with type 2 diabetes. We remain focused on gaining broad open access for Manzaro and expect the full impact of this medicine for patients and our business to be realized over time as that access is achieved. Turning to Q2 financial results and progress on our strategic deliverables, we saw a relatively flat top line performance in constant currency. As strong volume-driven growth for key products like Verzenio, Jardiance and Trulicity was offset by lower prices as well as for Alimta patent expiry in key markets around the world and last year's sale of Cialis rights in China. Volume for this quarter grew a robust 10%. When excluding revenue from Alimta, the sale of Cialis rights in China and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 6% compared to Q2 2021. In Q2, our newer medicines contributed 18% to volume growth and now account for 67% of our core business revenue which we believe, together with our robust pipeline is the most important indicator of the strength and durability of our growth outlook. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79.8% in Q2, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 20.5% which includes a negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to acquire in-process R&D and development milestone charges. At our investment community meeting in December, we outlined 5 potential new medicines that could launch over the next 2 years which could serve as catalysts to driving top-tier growth through the decade. There have been important pipeline development since our Q1 earnings call for all 5, including the U.S. approval and launch of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. FDA acceptance and priority review designation for purtaprutinib in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor. -- submissions for mirikizumab in ulcerative colitis in the EU and in Japan, positive top line 52-week data for lebrikizumab in moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. And we also announced U.S., EU and Japan regulatory approval for Olumiant in alopecia areata. Last month, we announced plans for a $2.1 billion investment in 2 new manufacturing sites here in Indiana to support increasing demand for existing products as well as demand for potential new medicines in our pipeline. This announcement followed Lilly's recent investments in new facilities in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Ireland and will further expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities such as genetic medicines. These investments underscore our confidence in the growth of our portfolio in the company. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends to our shareholders in Q2. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates. As previously announced in Q2, we entered into an agreement with the U.S. government to supply 150,000 doses of beptalizumab for approximately $275 million in an ongoing effort to provide COVID-19 treatment options for patients. Doses of beptalizumab valued at approximately $130 million were shipped in Q2 and the remainder of that order will ship in Q3. Today, we are announcing that in collaboration with the U.S. government, we intend to begin making beptilizumab available for purchase by states, hospitals and certain other providers through a sole distributor agreement. This will happen later this month which is prior to the anticipated depletion of the U.S. government's currently available supply. As we move from large ad hoc federal government purchases, the sales and distribution of COVID-19 antibodies to a broader set of purchasers, we will now integrate estimated sales into our forward guidance. As we have said previously, we don't see COVID-19 antibodies as a major long-term driver of growth for the company. Nevertheless, we will continue to do our part where we can to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic with the last monoclonal antibody treatment standing that neutralizes against the Omacron variant. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we've made in the second quarter. We're encouraged by the performance of our key growth products which now represent 67% of our core business. We expect to see this grow over time as we work to launch more innovative medicines like Manzaro. Excluding the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges, we expect to see operating margin expansion from both revenue growth and driving further efficiencies in our business. We saw significant progress in our pipeline this quarter with the approvals of Manzaro in type 2 diabetes and Illumina in alopecia areata. We also saw progress on our next wave of potential growth catalysts with the FDA acceptance of danonumab as well as pertibrutinib and positive top line readout for lebrikizumab and additional submissions for mirikizumab. Finally, we returned $900 million to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases. Looking to the future, we are confident in our long-term growth prospects as we are focused on developing groundbreaking therapies in areas of significant unmet need as well as driving exceptional execution for our recently launched medicines, so they reach patients who need them. Before we close, I'd like to comment as well. This is Kevin Hern last call as Head of our IR team. And before I turn the call over to him to moderate the Q&A session, I'd just like to thank him on behalf of our shareholders, our board and of course, our executive team and employees. He's done an outstanding job for the last 4.5 years, strengthening our relationships with -- the Street as well as being an ambassador to both convey the company's messages to shareholders but also inform management about shareholder perspectives. We wish him the best in his new assignment transitioning to a leadership role in our U.S. commercial group. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for his last Q&A session. Yes Chris, thanks for the question. I think everybody probably on the call has a good grasp of what's in this package, Difficult to speculate on probabilities but certainly a lot higher than a month ago that something crosses the line. There may be some adjustments to this as they go through that parliamentary process and whatever changes might occur or still to come in the center in the house. But if what we're looking at passes, maybe that's your question, as you know, we've been for the Part D forms, I think they're good incremental changes, particularly capping annual out-of-pocket and getting rid of the donut hole concept. Unfortunately, they don't improve the concept of facing patient cost sharing on net pricing which we were hoping it would. But by itself, we would support that. The CPI adjustment is not really an issue as probably everyone on this call knows, there's already lots of CPI capping that goes on in the commercial marketplace. And with CPI being where it is now as well. I think list prices in the drug business are not nearly as fast as the rest of the economy. But the negotiation piece is a problem. And I think in the short term, speaking for our company but probably the industry, it doesn't do much. They don't really start until '26 anyway. But in the midterm, there will be, of course, some products that will have attenuated life cycles. And I think that will cause some headwinds for the industry and we'll see if any Lilly products get caught up in that. But probably, to me, the most damaging thing about it is it sends a signal to investors and capital allocators like us that small molecules and particularly small molecules in diseases that require stepwise development like cancer, where we start in stage at later stages and work our way to adjuvant or even in some orphan conditions really aren't wanted and are worth a lot less. So, we'll focus our resources on other areas of innovation. We've got plenty of those. And so will the rest of the sector. And I think that's really a miss for the patients that probably want better oral cancer drugs in the future and orphan disease drugs. So I think that's probably not being talked about enough and I just wanted to emphasize that. Yes. Thanks, James. I mean, I guess, put a finer point on it. Each project will have to be evaluated one by one. But I think you will probably see 10 years down the line, fewer small molecule oral products developed in the industry than would have been otherwise the case if this bill passes. -- again, that to me is the miss. And I think it -- there's still probably quite a bit of advantage in oral small molecules in sort of large primary care indications, especially if in the case of like GLP, we could accept that weight loss will provide broader benefits for the earlier question about when sort of the belief system tips over and people just accept that chronic weight management could for health like reduced blood pressure is good for cardiovascular risk. And I think those products will be evaluated one by one and big opportunities, I think, will advance and do well. They'll have attenuated life cycle in the government business and that will have to be factored in but we'll look at that. What I was referring to is more, I think, in narrower revenue opportunities, it just gets a lot harder. And when -- by kind of construct, your new indications can't be compressed forward because of the way we develop drugs in some of these diseases, that's a problem. And I don't think that was well thought through and there will be a long-term implication to that. One other thing I probably should say is this bill raises $300 billion for the federal government off the back of the industry, probably cost the industry at least $0.5 trillion and only about $50 billion of that, like 10% is going back to patient benefit support. And I think that's another tenant when we were leading pharma literally was to make sure whatever came out of the industry went back to patients. That's not happening here and that needs to be discussed as well. Yes. Thanks, Seamus, for the question on our glucagon containing molecules. We previously said that we have 2 in clinical development, mazdutide which is our oxyntomodulin that's glucagon plus GLP-1 and retitrutide which is our ABG which is glucagon GLP-1 and GIP 1. You're right that the ACG molecule is a head and development that's in Phase II and the oxyntomodulin is still in Phase I. I think they're both viable as next-generation weight loss products. But to be clear here, it's a very high borrower looking for a major step change above the really remarkable results we saw in Surmont One. I think they both have that potential but we're going to need to see more data to know which it either goes forward to Phase II. -- just like when we're doing Phase II interzepatide which was just a few years ago, we noted that it had to have a step change to go forward to Phase III. If you hear us talk about when or growth of these molecules going to Phase III, it means we saw that kind of a big step change. Yes. Thanks for that question, Tim. You're raising an interesting point. I think implicit in your question is the observation that there's a lot of health benefits that come from losing weight Obesity is a risk factor for a number of things, not just the things that are traditionally measured in cardiovascular outcome studies or MACE studies. So probably also noting, we've called this morbidity mortality outcomes, MMO in obesity rather than CVOT. But beyond that, I think we've intentionally not gotten into details on the primary endpoint or the powering assumption. So that is yet to be disclosed. Thanks, Dan. Maybe just -- David, just to clarify that, because the way you framed your question, you said we're up against supply constraints. In the case of Major, as we said today in the prepared text, we don't anticipate supply constraints in the U.S. Of course, before introducing a product in a new market, we want to make sure we could fully initiate new patients and supply. And based on our competitors' actions, it's hard to predict a year from now what we'll need in a given market. So it's not that we don't have supply. It's more -- the demand picture is unstable. We want to -- we're just cautioning that we want to know that before we initiated a launch sequence. But we've launched in the U.S. and we're committed to that supply. It's not that we have an issue, just to be clear. I guess, first off, can you talk about how pronounced the cash pay component was of the early kind of Majoro number? And then how you expect maybe that to evolve? And then separately, maybe coming back to the drug pricing question but from a different angle, it would appear that Lilly could be one of the main beneficiaries from lower out-of-pocket costs on that side and you think about sort of improvement in compliance. So can you maybe help frame that impact or maybe think about how compliance today differs in the U.S. versus maybe other markets where those out-of-pocket costs or not it can don't exist? Yes. Carter, I think you're pointing out something as I mentioned, we would be supportive as a freestanding measure of the Part D reforms that are in this reconciliation package for a bunch of reasons. One, it does, I think, more fairly distribute the burden of the industry pay for into Part D. Today, the way the donut hole math works, if you go back a couple of years, we had a lot of earnings calls, we had to describe that. There's this really disproportionate contribution from the industry inside the donut hole. So commonly used medications like in diabetes and cardiovascular, have a pretty big hit on that. That gets smoothed out. So now that drugs that hit the catastrophic pay more and it's more of a balanced contribution independent of drug type, that's a good thing for companies like Lilly, that have more commonly used drugs. The other thing though you're pointing out and I think this really would affect a product like Verzenio for us primarily is patients who get thrown into the catastrophic have this uncapped 5% contribution today. And we know that not only do patients discontinue and you mentioned about compliance rates which are better in oral oncology in Europe than the U.S., for instance. But I think also you'll see more initiation because physicians and their families screen themselves out of even qualifying for an appropriate medication for themselves because of financial burden and maybe go to chemotherapy instead of a more targeted therapy. So that presents another way in which we can both improve healthcare in America but also prospects for medicines at Lilly max. So those are good things. As I said, on balance, we still don't like it for the negotiation side but those are positive elements. Maybe one question on the SELECT-EARLY study, the diabetic study. So maybe one for you, Dan. What you really need to show how long the trial and what you need to show in terms of delta versus control to be -- to prove that it is beneficial in prediabetic patients. And wouldn't oral JLP a better drug for those patients Yes. That's an early diabetes study. But I think you're -- I don't believe we've disclosed the design of the endpoints yet. But I think with respect to diabetes prevention, that's certainly a very interesting area. And there are currently FDA guidance on what's required to show diabetes prevention of diabetes to get that kind of claim. It's a very high bar. And I suspect the field will come to an understanding about which drugs can actually decrease the risk of getting diabetes you can prevent diabetes before any drug is able to get that indication. I think this class of medications, particularly tirzepatide has great promise in that area. We highlighted the data from Sumant that showed the vast majority, more than 95% of people were prediabetic at the beginning of the study had normal glucose levels at the end of the study. That's really promising. -- longer-term data, including drug washout data required to get to that kind of claim. So as part of the FDA acceptance of your accelerated approval filing for donanemab, have you gotten clarity from the agency if the iADRS scale is acceptable as an acceptable endpoint for full approval? And can you also talk about what you saw with the N3 PG4 to move it into Phase III? Yes. Thanks for the 2 Alzheimer's questions. So first one is on the accelerated approval application for genenimab and whether that's an opportunity to gain more insight about acceptability of iADRS which is our primary endpoint in the Phase III study. It may not be an opportunity actually because the accelerated approval is not contingent on an understanding of the cognitive or functional benefits of denetumab which we saw in the Phase II trial. Instead, the accelerated approval is just simply contingent on a demonstration of lowering amyloid levels. So I'm not sure we'll get into a deep discussion of that, although clearly, it's relevant in terms of the confirmatory study, Trailblazer 2.

            "name": "Mike Mason",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Geoff. Thanks for the question. What we've seen -- first of all, we're incredibly excited about the very robust launch we've had with Manzaro. We're also excited about the source of business that we're seeing. 72% of Monday's is coming from new patients into the entrain class. We think that's very important for accelerating class growth and we have seen class growth both at total prescriptions, new-to-brand and NTS accelerate since BonCharles launch. Of the 28% of the volume that's coming from switches, only 30% of that is from Trulicity and 70% is from other GLPs. And so as a result, as Anat indicated earlier, we're actually seeing Lilly incretin share market growing which is the sign that we -- of a robust solid foundation that we're laying. And so the NBRx have increased our share by the Lilly share in the injectable market by 12% and new to treatment starts by 10%. So we're very happy. We're growing the class and the market share at the same time. Your second question around payer dynamics, it's going as expected for us. We're trying to stay very disciplined. I think our focus is to set ourselves up for long-term success, not short-term success. -- and that's what we're doing. So it's going as expected. So far, we have both commercial and Part D access on Express Scripts, Cigna and Humana formularies. Yes, great question. The SURMOUNT 1 data was phenomenal data for patients and physicians who treat obesity. We -- I think there's a combination of effects that will affect employers and the government to increase access for obesity agents. One is the data we produce. And I think, obviously, the first data we're producing is the weight loss as well as the factors like lipids and blood pressure. And the data we produce so far has been stellar. So I think the better data we produce and Surmont 1 through SMA4 is just going to help us in the short term. Long term, we think there's a lot of comorbid conditions associated with obesity like CV and heart failure and sleep Pactia and the better data we support there will open up those indications where are highly have a lot of overlap with obesity. And so we're excited about those trials and seeing those data as those trials complete. And then lastly, the more we can drive consumer interest in this, that puts pressure on employers and the government to be able to gain access for this. And so I think we've got strong plans on all 3 fronts and we're excited about the first data disclosure we've had on obesity. So we're very bullish on the long-term prospects of the obesity market and rolling it. Okay. Thanks, Terrence, for those questions. Long term, I think our goals there is obviously to optimize our net price but also secure broad access like we have for Trulicity. So those are our 2 goals. Obviously, we don't give specifics on our net price negotiations publicly. But we're pleased with the progress. We're staying disciplined, trying to accelerate access before any new product launch. You got to be careful that you're not too aggressive, you get access to early but you pay too much for it. So we're staying disciplined. We've got a great product with a great profile. Payers are seeing that but it's a process and we're going through that process right now. From a supply perspective, Mongeral, as Anat said, we were planning for success. And so we had a lot of different launch scenarios. And we have lot scenarios that considered this level of uptake. As Anat shared, we don't anticipate any supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Manzaro. We -- our manufacturing team has been working around the clock for years to build manufacturing capacity throughout the supply chain. We have a number of sites who make this and they're optimizing our initial capacity on a daily basis. Also, we have made investments to expand our capacity over the next several years. We have a new parental plant at Research Dragon Park in North Carolina that's coming online in 2023 and another one behind that in Concord, North Carolina. Also, we're building 2 manufacturing facilities to make taconigredient for Mongeral and those will come on at a later time. So obviously, we're planning for success. And -- our manufacturing team is working around the clock to get as much of past supply as possible. Yes. On the head-to-head versus sema 2.4 milligram, there's been no head-to-head trials comparing receppatide to sema 2.4. So we believe there was a good opportunity to do that to demonstrate tirzepatide significant weight loss benefits and totality, the benefits it has for patients. Head-to-head studies are the gold standards. Every time we talk to healthcare professionals, they really value and get a lot out of head-to-head studies. It just really informs their treatment. So we think it's the right thing to do and we're pleased to do that. It's going to be a head-to-head study, where we're comparing tuxepatide versus 72.4 in people that have obesity and overweight with the weight-related core mobility. Other than that, we'll provide more on the design and the time line at the later date as we get closer to posting it on clinicaltrials.gov. Thanks andrew. I appreciate the question. Let me just even said everyone, our label on Mongeral advisers women using contract oral contraception to switch to or add to a non-oral contraceptive methods for 4 weeks during initiation of the product and then during the dose titration for each dose. Given the -- so healthcare professionals are aware of this, given the profound benefits of Mongeral, this hasn't impacted at all HCP and consumer interest in Montara. If you look at the data in the marketplace, we have data with ONKVIA through July 22 which is just 5 weeks of full promotion. And we've -- and Mounjaro already reached 20% new brand share market. So we haven't seen this as an issue at all. As to the future works for and evaluating the issue, we have nothing new to report to investors at this time. But this has not been an issue that has impacted Montara's uptake at all. Okay Dave, thanks. I'll give you more context of the percentages that we had earlier on in the call. So what we're looking at is IQVIA data, the beginning of that by our analysis is June 3. We had our launch meeting the week after ADA, so the week of June 14 and -- so we have been promoting kind of full on since then. And so when you compare where we're at today, this is -- we have IQVA data through July 22, so 5 weeks of promotion. So we're comparing the -- our NBRx volume, our new-to-brand volume and share at July 22 versus June 13 in the injectable anchor gen market. And so what we've seen since then is that Montero's NBRx share has reached 20.5%. We saw Trulicity's NBRx has declined by only 8.4 share points. And so that produces a net gain in the Lilly injected NBRx share of 12.2%. And -- and then with NTS same time period, same market, we have a 10% overall Lilly injectable NBR share gain. Yes, it's a good question. I think we're getting what we expected we thought we would see more new patients into the class. That's who we talk about with healthcare professionals and that's what we're getting. So we're not surprised by that, pretty typical what we'd expect with the new GLP launch. Now what you would expect when you have a new product like Monger especially with endocrinologists that they don't always see naive patients. They have a good bolus of patients who are already on GLPs. And so when they -- when we talked to them about Montero, they're excited about the opportunity to actually switch some of the patients who are not performing or not at goal at the current GLP. And so I think early on, you'll see like a higher percent coming from switches versus naive. And so today, we have 72% that is naive. If you look at at Trulicity, that's in like 88%. So what I would expect is that, that percentage coming from AE will grow over time. But I think this is what we would expect at launch and we're very pleased by both Trulicity and Darryl's performance since Mangerahas launched. Carter, thanks for the question. On the cash pay side, we expect the percent of cash paid to follow our percent access in the marketplace. What we've seen so far, again, I reiterate what I said earlier, that we have both Part D and commercial access for Humana, Express Scripts on the National Preferred Formulary and Cigna. If you add that up, that's a little over 20% of the national lives. And so I think that's probably the best estimation of what you probably see with the cash pay. Yes. That's a good question. I think naturally, payers will ask for additional rebates when a new product joins a formulary. So as part of our discussion of being disciplined and why you don't want to accelerate those discussions too rapidly and that's a factor into it. So I think net-net, I don't expect any step changes in GLP pricing as a result of Montero launching but it is part of the national pressure intention and contract negotiations. Yes, I can add a few comments on that. This study is for people with diabetes have been diagnosed with diabetes. And we want to test what the impact could be on the progression of diabetes if you put a product like tirzepatide on very early in the course of treatment. And so this will study putting \u2013 starting patients who are nai\u0308ve or very early in their treatment versus standard of care. We think weight loss with the benefits of a GLP and GIP and the improvement in beta cell function and insulin sensitivity could have a profound impact of disrupting type 2 diabetes. And so that's what we're testing in the study. It's one that we're very excited about. And we've already started to see weekly injectables being used earlier than just the injection space as more people understand that a weekly injection through an auto injector is a good experience and actually some some consumers prefer orals but some actually consume prefer a weekly injection with an auto injector like Monaro and Trulicity has."

            "content": "Thanks, Anat. Looking across Lilly R&D, I continue to be quite encouraged by the potential we have to turn cutting-edge science into life-changing medicines for patients. This potential is becoming a reality in the late-stage portfolio, where I'll focus my remarks today. But also it's becoming more and more evident in our earlier-stage projects and I look forward to providing updates on some of these assets in future quarters. Given updates we provided at ADA in June, including detailed results from Surmont 1, I'll focus today's R&D update on the late-stage progress since our last earnings call more generally. Slide 14 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 1 and Slide 15 shows potential key events for the year. I'll cover both of these slides by therapeutic area. Starting with Immunology; along with our partner, Insight, we're proud that Olumiant has now been approved as a first-in-disease systemic treatment for adults with severe alopecia areata in the U.S., EU and Japan. Alopecia areata is a significant unmet medical need and we're delighted about what this medicine could mean for people living with this disease. We also announced top line data from the lebrikizumab Phase III monotherapy maintenance studies in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis which showed 80% of lebrikizumab responders maintained improvements in skin clearance and disease severity at 52 weeks. Data supported both once every 2-week and once every 4-week maintenance dosing with consistent and durable responses. We believe the potential for a once every 4-week maintenance dosing regimen could be an important point of differentiation for patients and healthcare providers. Lilly's planning submission of lebrikizumab to the FDA in 2022, followed by submissions to other regulatory agencies around the world. Almirall has rights to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis in Europe and is planning for submission to the EMA in 2022. Shifting to mirikizumab. We presented results from the Phase III maintenance study LUCENT-2, at the DDW meeting. This study showed that for patients who responded to treatment on mirikizumab in the 12-week induction period, 50% of patients who received mirikizumab maintenance therapy achieved clinical remission at 1 year compared to 1/4 of patients randomized to placebo. In addition to the U.S. regulatory submission of mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis that we announced earlier this year, we have now submitted in the EU and Japan. Also noted here in Immunology is a Phase II start for a BTLA agonist antibody in SLE and our new KB103 inhibitor shown in Phase I. Our IL-2 conjugate is now listed under its nonproprietary name, RespegAltusleukin. Moving to diabetes. We're thrilled that Manjaris now approved in the U.S. is the first and only GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. We're pleased to have received a positive CHMP opinion in the European Union and we're hopeful for a full approval by the EMA later this quarter. We presented the exciting detailed results from Surmont 1, evaluating truzepatide for treatment of weight management and participants with obesity or overweight at ADA with simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. New data included an exploratory analysis that showed roughly 40% of patients achieved at least 25% weight reduction on the 15-milligram dose compared to less than 1% of patients on placebo. Additionally, we saw meaningful reductions in blood pressure and lipids as well as reduction in fat mass that was nearly 3x greater than that in lean mass. Encouraging data also showed that for those patients who had prediabetes at the start of the study, over 95% returned to normal glucose levels. The efficacy, safety and tolerability data in Surmont 1 exceeded our expectations. Based on our existing robust data set for tirzepatide, we've now engaged with the FDA and we'll have a meeting soon to evaluate whether there's a potential path forward to registration for chronic weight management based on Surmont 1, combined with data from the SURPASS program. We'll continue to communicate to investors as there are material updates. We continue to expand our clinical program for tirzepatide and we've now initiated our Phase III study evaluating tirzepatide for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. We also have become -- we also begun a new trial called SURPASS EARLY which evaluates the long-term safety and efficacy of tirzepatide compared to standard of care when initiated early in the course of type 2 diabetes. Later this year, we'll begin surmount 5, a head-to-head study comparing weight reduction for tirzepatide versus semaglutide 2.4 milligrams. And finally, later this year, we expect to initiate Surmount MMO, our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study. Moving to our weekly basal insulin Fc, also known as BIF. We've now initiated a second Phase III trial Q2 which is evaluating BIF compared to DEGLIDEC in adults with type 2 diabetes who are starting basal insulin for the first time. Our Phase II GGG triagonist is now listed under its nonproprietary name, Retitrutide. Also in this area, 2 assets have now entered Phase I clinical development, our dual amylin calcitonin receptor agonist or DACRA and our PNPLA3-SIRNA. In oncology, we are announcing today that the FDA has accepted the filing for partabrutinub in mantle cell lymphoma for patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor with priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. Improved treatment options are needed for this challenging disease and we're encouraged that this potential new medicine could be available to patients in early 2023 -- in early phase oncology, we've moved our mutant-selective PI3-kinase alpha inhibitor into Phase I development. And finally, moving to neuroscience. We're also pleased to announce the FDA has accepted the filing for genimab for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and has granted priority review designation under an accelerated approval pathway. We continue to look forward to the top line results of the Phase III confirmatory study, Trailblazer ALS 2 by mid-2023 which, if positive, will form the basis of our application for traditional regulatory approval. You also noticed we're now referring to N3PG4 by its nonproprietary name Rimtenatak. We plan to initiate the Phase III program for remternatac in the coming weeks. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now, I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Louise, thanks for that question. Of course, we always reach for our competitors' success on clinical trials. We want great data so that we can have great drugs to help patients. I think the novo they pass the interim analysis but didn't stop the trial for efficacy is fine. I think there's really pretty significant differences here between tirzepatide and semaglutide that we just have to remember, a different mechanism, a different degree of efficacy on various outcomes, different trial designs, different populations to some extent. So we don't change our design of our SURMOUNT MMO study. We don't change our thinking about probably success. As Mike said earlier, we're highly confident in this mechanism. -- based on all of the data that we've seen, of course, starting with a quite dramatic weight loss which should be a benefit on morbidity and mortality from obesity. But also all of the cardiovascular indicators that we reported out in that Phase III study, including a very significant drop in blood pressure that should have a benefit -- a drop in LDL, an increase in HDL a drop in triglycerides, all of that should contribute to cardiovascular outcomes. So we remain excited and confident about our own study going forward. Louise, thanks for the question on Alzheimer's. So the fact is bottom line is we remain convinced about the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab and the Alzheimer's portfolio. Our focus right now is obviously on the rapid availability of donanemab for the appropriate patients through the accelerated approval pathway and then reconsideration with Phase III data. And we remain optimistic that with -- particularly with traditional FDA approval, FDA -- or sorry, CMS would not continue to limit coverage for on-label treatments. Now obviously, you mentioned competitor readout. As we've noted on prior calls, there is a chance that we'll see mixed results in some of these readouts due to the differences in the medicines and their trial designs. And as you know well, we have some unique design features in TV2 and a medicine that demonstrates rapid and deep plaqclearance. So we won't be discouraged if others miss their primary endpoints. And so we'll be following that closely, obviously. But in the near term, of course, we have to acknowledge that patient access will be very limited under the current CMS and CD with accelerated approval. But what that does do with the accelerated approval is really enable us to engage quickly with CMS following that Phase III data and hopefully drive reconsideration at that point. And it also allows us to accelerate the traditional approval through a supplemental BLA. So what we'll do in the near term, following a potential approval and the accelerated pathway is use that time to build out the diagnostic ecosystem to help physicians with the referral process and infusion systems. And so there's quite a bit to do, I think, to get ready for that Phase III data. Yes. Thanks,. I understand where your question is going and we probably don't weigh in specifically on what others might do or see but I'll tell you how we run DSMBs and how we think about them generally across the industry. There's a couple of principles at play here. First, of course, is independence. This is not something run by the sponsor. And I think that's an important consideration for patient safety. We don't see the data they see and we're not privy to the discussions as a rule. The second is that we do set for DSMB's rules in advance by which they should make decisions. Those could be very simple rules in some cases, like hit statistical significance with a certain alpha on the primary endpoint or they could be more complex rules looking for consistency across secondaries or subpopulations or a higher bar of efficacy on the primary so that you're sure that you have a compelling effect that varies from study study and sponsor to sponsor. I'm sure. The third thing is that the recommendations that DSMBs get back to sponsors are often prespecified. So we'll tell the DSMB if it meets these criteria. This is what you tell us. And if it doesn't, this is what you tell us. And they usually are a matter of fact, without color that could compromise the integrity or cause one unblinding of an ongoing study. So I hope that's helpful in understanding how DSMBs work. I think at many companies, if there is a surprising recommendation for the DSMB such as to stop a study, there will often be a process where the sponsor or 1 or 2 representatives of the sponsor are unblinded so they can confirm the DSMB conclusion before taking action. But that wouldn't be typical for a simple study continuous kind of decision."

So we'll do that in this setting as well in the context of BTK pretreated relapsed/refractory metal cell lymphoma. What that -- from there, the NCCN and other guideline process is completely independent and has no involvement from us whatsoever to the extent that they choose to do something beyond our labeled indication is really completely out of our hands and hard for me to speculate on -- and of course, we'll be promoting the product only on the labeled indication that we received."

            "name": "A - Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2022. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We had a few notable items impacting the year-over-year financial comparisons. Foreign exchange rates had roughly 300 basis point impact on revenue this quarter as we saw Q2 revenue declined 4% or 1% on a constant currency basis. In Q2 of 2021, we sold our rights to Cialis in China resulted in $170 million of onetime revenue impact. And this quarter, we also saw the full impact of the loss of exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan and have started to see the impact of multiple generic entrants in the U.S. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Hopefully, you heard I will repeat my last intent. So when excluding revenue from Alimta, the sales of Calistri in China in Q2 of last year and COVID antibody total revenue grew 6%, highlighting the solid momentum for our core business in the second quarter. We expect that this growth rate will accelerate in the second half of the year. Moving on to gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 50 basis points to 79.8% in Q2 of 2022. This increase in gross margin was primarily driven by product mix and the favorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventory sold, partially offset by lower realized prices. Increase in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation had a modest negative impact on gross margin in Q2. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter which as discussed on our Q1 earnings call, are now inclusive of acquired in-process R&D and development milestone charges following guidance from the SEC. -- acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges represented nearly 1,200 basis points of the Q2 OpEx growth. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 4%, driven mostly by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. R&D expenses increased 8%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of $440 million or $0.46 of EPS primarily related to a charge associated with the buyer of substantially all future obligations that are contingent upon the development, regulatory and commercial success of our mutant selective PI3K alpha inhibitor. In Q2 2021, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges were $43 million or $0.04 of EPS. Operating income decreased 32% in Q2, primarily due to higher acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 20.5% which includes the negative impact of approximately 680 basis points attributed to these charges. Other income and expense was expense of approximately $13 million this quarter compared with income of $5 million in Q2 of 2021. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 14.2%, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. The -- this decrease was driven by favorable tax impact related to the implementation of a provision of the 2017 Tax Act related to the capitalization of R&D expenses, offset by the tax impact of nondeductible development milestones. At the bottom line, earnings per share declined 32% this quarter to $1.25 per share. The most significant driver of the year-over-year decline was the impact of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges which had $0.46 negative impact in Q2 of this year compared to $0.04 in Q2 of last year. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 6%. Excluding revenue from Alimta which declined significantly due to broad generic entry in May and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 11% in the U.S. This volume-driven growth was led by Trulicity, Verzenio and Dorian. We experienced a net price decline of 8% for Q2, driven by lower realized prices for Humalog, ALIMTA and Forteo due to higher rebated segments, making slightly larger portion of the business, higher contracted rates and the list price reduction for insulin lives for injection this year. Lower realized prices for Taltz were also a driver due to the impact of changes to estimates for rebates and discounts, largely driven by favorable adjustment in the base period and to a lesser extent, continued pull-through of existing access. For the first half of 2022, net price decline in the U.S. was 4% and we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline for the full year. Moving to Europe. Revenue in Q2 grew 1% in constant currency. Excluding revenue from Alinta which lost exclusivity in June of 2021, revenue grew 12% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Jardiance, False and Verzenio. For Japan, Q2 revenue decreased 22% in constant currency as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta which both faced generic entry beginning in June 2021. Key growth products represented 69% of total revenue in Japan and grew 11% in Q2 on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect a return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue declined 32% in constant currency, driven by the impact of the NRDL formulary access, resulting in lower realized prices, partially offset by increased volume for certain newer products, including Verzenio, Tyva, Trulicity and Taltz. We also experienced a price decline for Humalog due to the impact of volume-based procurement. We expect improved access to continue to drive future volume growth more than offsetting the price decline over time. With the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in China and to subsequent protective measures intended to control the spread of the virus, we have seen lower volume than we otherwise would have expected in Q2, particularly for infused products. For Tivit, we are also seeing the impact of increased competitive pressures. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 3% in constant currency, primarily driven by increased sales of key growth products. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit net price decline in each of the U.S., EU and Japan and a double-digit price decline in China, resulting in a worldwide net price decline in the high single digits. As shown on Slide 9, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove 18 percentage points of volume growth this quarter and continue to underpin our overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contribution of our key growth products. This quarter, these brands grew 20% or nearly 24% in constant currency, generating $4.3 billion in sales and making up 67% of our core business revenue. We continue to see further growth opportunities for these products. For example, we're extremely pleased to see the strong trajectory of Verzenio driven by the adjuvant indication, including recent acceleration in new to brand share of market. In the injectable incretin market, we see significant opportunity for further class growth as these medicines currently make up only 25% of total prescription in the U.S. branded diabetes market and have the prospect of expanding the market through the earlier usage for glucose control and weight loss in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Trulicity is experiencing accelerated demand in many international markets due to market growth and the limited availability of competitor GLP in select markets. We are working to meet this increased demand, while also implementing actions in select countries to manage growth and minimize patient impact. This outlook for Trulicity is included in our guidance. Lilly is thrilled to have both Trulicity which has the longest length of therapy of any GLP-1 and Mounjaro which could offer a step change in innovation for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other metabolic indications as option in this class of medicine. Given the excitement and significant interest with the FDA approval of Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes, I'd like to briefly provide an update on what we're seeing and hearing in terms of early launch. After U.S. approval in mid-May, our full scale launch began in mid-June. Our commercial team is prepared, energized and observing a high level of engagement across channels as we roll out a patient-centric approach to launching Monga for patients with type 2 diabetes. The financial results you see from Anjar today reflect significant utilization of samples were accepted and co-pay assistance program to get patients off to a strong start. Pierre negotiations are progressing as expected and we're taking a disciplined approach to establish Monza's access and are focused on delivering the same broad open access which we achieved for Trulicity. As we remain focused on strong execution, we're encouraged by the prescription trends from Mounjaro, including the most recent IQVIA data, shown over 20% share of market for new-to-brand prescriptions in the Type 2 diabetes injectable incretin class. We are also pleased to see that total Lilly-Ntabren share in the type 2 diabetes injectable incurring class has grown nearly 12 percentage points since the launch of Mounjaro. Given the heavy utilization of co-pay cards as we build out access for Mounjaro, prescription trends will likely provide a more accurate measure of launch uptake than net sales over the next few quarters. We are pleased with the initial uptake of Mounjaro which is at the high end of our contemplated scenarios. We do not anticipate supply constraints for the U.S. launch of Mounjaro and we will monitor U.S. uptake to determine the appropriate timing for OUS launches. As a reminder, over the last several years, we have made significant investments to grow our global manufacturing capacity to support Manja volume, including our new RTP side in North Carolina which will come online in 2023. On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. For the first half of the year, we invested $4.5 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent as we continue to fund our key marketed products and expected new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 13 is our updated 2022 financial guidance. Our full year revenue outlook is unchanged. And -- it now includes an additional $400 million of headwind from foreign exchange rates since our previous guidance update for a total impact of roughly $700 million of FX headwind for the full year compared with our original guidance. This incremental headwind is offset by additional forecasted revenue from our COVID-19 antibody betolizumab which includes $275 million from the U.S. government agreement announced in June of this year as well as estimated revenue from the inception of non-U.S. government distribution that Dave mentioned earlier. As we look ahead, Q3 will mark the first full quarter impact of Alimta U.S. fab Nexi. In addition, Q3 of 2021 revenue benefited from Ilunion COVID-19 sales that will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our top line growth in the quarter. Our outlook for gross margin, SG&A and research and development remains unchanged. While the range is unchanged, SG&A does include additional commercial investments for selected key growth products in the second half of the year. Our guidance now include acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges of approximately $610 million, reflecting total charges in the first half of the year. We have had no material acquired IP R&D or development milestone charges at this point in Q3 and this guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transactions in the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 100 basis points to approximately 27% and 29%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact attributable to foreign exchange rates and acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges to date. Our non-GAAP range for other income and expense remains unchanged. On a reported basis, other income and expense is now expected to be expense in the range of $500 million to $600 million, reflecting the impact of net losses on investments in equity securities during the second quarter. Our tax rate and EPS in the first half of the year still includes a favorable impact of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year assumes this provision will be deferred or repealed by Congress, effective for 2022. We -- if this provision is not the further repealed effective this year, then we would expect a reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.34 to now be in the range of $6.96 to $7.11 per share and lowered our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.25 to be in the range of $7.90 to $8.05. The $0.25 reduction in our non-GAAP EPS range is driven entirely by the impact of foreign exchange rates as the impact of EPS of acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges for selected -- and selected products are offset by impact of additional sales of baptilozumab. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D."

            "content": "Yes. Steve, thanks for the question. First, what we've seen is an accelerated demand for Trulicity in many of our international markets and there's probably 3 sources of that one, great commercial success. We've been really successful in our diabetes portfolio in driving the growth and utilization of Trulicity. At the same time, we've seen accelerated market growth. And we have seen in some select markets, the amplified demand for Trulicity because semaglutide is not available in full extent in a number of markets. In terms of where we've seen volatility in where that is occurring. And so we're evaluating the local situation is quite dynamic and we're ramping up as much as we can to need this amplified demand. At the same time, in some of these markets, we're going to have to look at managing some of the growth and making sure we limit any kind of patient impact."

As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Kevin. 2022 is off to a strong start with, solid volume driven revenue growth led by our key products and the new tirzepatide obesity data we announced this morning. We are focused on driving adoption of our newer medicines, preparing for key product launches, delivering several global submissions for potential new medicines, all the while advancing our pipeline to power the next wave of growth. We are pleased with the progress we saw in the first quarter. Before I get to our results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to address the tragic loss of life and the hardships we are seeing in Ukraine. Our Ukraine office is currently closed and operations are suspended. The safety of our employees and their families continues to be our top priority. We are working through logistical challenges in order to ensure supply of our medicines to those in need in Ukraine. Earlier this month, an initial shipment of medicines donated by Lilly including insulin arrived in Ukraine. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our partners, project HOPE and Direct Relief. Few of our clinical trial participants are in Ukraine. So while we are doing everything we can to ensure continuity of their medical care, there is minimal impact to our global trials. With regard to Russia, we have suspended investments, our promotional activities and new clinical trials there. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need. Should we generate any profits from our sales in Russia, we will donate them to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of our total company sales in 2021. Moving to our results. You can see on slide four the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue grew 15% or 17% on a constant currency basis and was driven by volume growth of 20%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta due to loss of exclusivity, revenue grew 10% for the quarter. This volume driven performance in Q1 is attributable to our key growth products, which grew 24% and now account for 61% of our core business. With long IP runways for many of these products and less than 10% of our 2022 revenue exposed to patent expiry in the next five years, along with the potential launch of five new medicines over the next 18 months, the durability of our growth outlook is quite strong. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in Q1, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. Excluding revenue from COVID antibodies, gross margin was approximately 80% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, an increase of roughly 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by both higher gross margin and lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies. In our pipeline, we have several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including the U.S. and EU approval for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, as well as a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for an early start to the Phase III trial studying Jardiance for chronic kidney disease due to clear positive efficacy. The U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The recent U.S. submission of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and a positive Phase III topline readout for SURMOUNT-1, the first of four global studies to evaluate tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight. Dan will talk in more detail later, but we are very excited with the results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-1 topline readout. We believe there is significant potential for tirzepatide to build off the impressive results we saw from our clinical program in Type 2 diabetes and help people with obesity, a disease impacting over 110 million people in United States and approximately 650 million people worldwide. Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease that causes over 2.8 million deaths globally each year. The economic impact associated with obesity is more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. We believe addressing obesity could make a difference in millions of people\u2019s lives, have a significant impact on public health and reduce healthcare costs. We are hopeful that we are entering a new era of obesity care, where people have medicines that can help treat their obesity and this is our first proof point on that journey. We continue to rapidly advance nucleic acid innovation at Lilly, building on our growing portfolio with the launch of the Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicines, a $700 million facility in Boston. We will develop novel RNA and DNA-based medicines, as well as push the boundaries of delivery technology to unlock difficult to treat targets in key strategic areas for us like neurodegeneration, diabetes and obesity. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends in the quarter and completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases. On slide five and six, you will see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates we are discussing today. Now, I will turn the call over to Anat to review the Q1 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q1, it is important to note that beginning this quarter, following directions from the SEC, presentation of non-GAAP measures will not include upfront charges and development milestones related to acquired in-process R&D and development. While this has no bearing on how we conduct our business, it will have an impact on how we represent -- how we present our non-GAAP measures. This change in presentation of financial results will have the effect of pulling into non-GAAP measures, certain charges that were previously reported owning our GAAP financial results. We expect this change will increase non-GAAP operating expenses and decrease non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share. To help with year-on-year comparison of our non-GAAP measures, you can find a revised workbook in our Investor website, reflecting the updated presentation of our 2020 and 2021 results. Slide seven summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2022. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue grew 15%, excluding COVID -- excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue increased 10%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 70 basis points to 76.1% in Q1 2022. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in Q1 2021, partially offset by increased sales of COVID antibodies, which have lower gross margin profile than the rest of our portfolio and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Increase in manufacturing costs and logistics due to inflation had a modest impact on gross margin in Q1. Total operating expenses decreased 6% this quarter, which as a reminder, is now inclusive of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1%, while R&D expenses decreased 4%, driven by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $166 million or $0.15 of EPS, primarily related to purchase of the Priority Review Voucher. In Q1 2021, acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were $312 million or $0.27 of EPS. Operating income increased 66% in Q1, driven by higher revenue, primarily due to higher sales of COVID antibodies, lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies, and to a lesser extent, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 33.4% for the quarter and reflects the benefit from COVID-19 antibodies revenue, as well as the negative impact of approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Other income and expense was income of approximately $38 million this quarter, compared with income of $35 million in Q1 2021. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 10.3%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter, partially offset by decreased tax expenses related to the implementation of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act required to capitalize research and development expenses. As the bottomline, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 63% in Q1, inclusive of approximately 1500 basis points related to lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 31% and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in the U.S. This growth was driven by volume, led by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, and Taltz. We experienced a net price decline of 1% for the quarter and continue to expect a mid single-digit price decline in the U.S. for the full year. As a reminder, a single competitor to Alimta launch in the U.S. in February and we expect broad generic entry in may result in a significant erosion of U.S. Alimta revenue. Moving to Europe, revenue in Q1 declined 13% in constant currency and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. We expect continued growth in Europe excluding Alimta. For Japan, Q1 revenue decreased 21% in constant currency, as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta. Key growth products now represent 65% of total revenue in Japan and we expect to return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency. The NRDL access has driven significant volume growth for newer products like Tyvyt, Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz, and has been partially offset by related price decreases. We expect this improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent protective measures that are currently being put in place to control the spread of the virus highlight the potential for commercial impact in China in the near-term, particularly for infused products, like Tyvyt. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 29% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by $95 million in revenue from the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, as well as by increased sales of key growth products. We continue to expect a mid single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan, with the worldwide net price decline in the high single-digit driven by the expanded NRDL access for our products in China. As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 15% points of volume growth this quarter and continue to bolster overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated $3.9 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue, growing 24%. We are pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders, as well as with the strong Taltz prescription growth. We are also encouraged by the significant uptake of Verzenio in Q1, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2022, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased 1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to fund our key market product and expect the new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 12 is the updated 2022 financial guidance. As I previously noted, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures will now include IPR&D and development milestone charges. For guidance, we will include charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of the earnings release and will not include any impact from potential or pending business development. We are providing information that should make this change as easy as possible to understand, as well as incorporate into modeling. As always, please let us know if there\u2019s anything else we can do to be of assistance as you navigate through this transition. I do want to reiterate that margin expansion continues to be priority for our team. Consistent with prior communication, excluding IPR&D development milestone charges, we expect to drive further non-GAAP operating margin expansion over time. Getting into the numbers underline our updated guidance, there is several items of benefits first quarter results, which are not expected to recur. These include approximately $1.45 billion of COVID antibody sales, U.S. Alimta revenue of approximately $250 million that will be impacted by multi-source generic entrants in Q2 and beyond, a favorable effective tax rate and a one-time benefit related to the resolution of cefaclor patent litigation in Canada. I would also remind you that as we look ahead to the second quarter, the Q2 2021 revenue benefited from the sale of Cialis rights in China, which will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our topline growth in Q2. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the guidance range by $1 billion to now be in the range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion, reflecting the additional revenue for bebtelovimab sales in Q1. While project an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate, we are expecting to offset it with stronger core business performance. We anticipate that any additional revenue from sales of COVID-19 antibodies to be limited begin in Q2 2022, while the U.S. Government has an option to purchase additional 500,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than July 31st of this year, it is uncertain whether this option will be exercised, and therefore, it is not included in our guidance. Moving down the income statement, GAAP gross margin percent is now expected to be approximately 76%, while non-GAAP margin, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 78%. The majority of this 200 basis point reduction is due to the impact of Q1 bebtelovimab sales, which have lower gross margin and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately $100 million in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation. The range for R&D expenses has been increased by $100 million to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, driven by investment in our late-stage pipeline, primarily Alzheimer\u2019s clinical development and investment to advance to diagnostics ecosystem. Our guidance includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $521 million, reflecting Q1 charges of $166 million, with the remainder primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of future obligations that were contingent upon development, regulatory and commercial success of our Meudon selective PI3K inhibitor. This guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transaction. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 200 basis points to approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact associated with the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges to date. Given the accounting change for acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, in the inherent variability associated with such charges, our non-GAAP operating margin figure will not measure efficiency in the same way it has done historically. However, you contract our operating margin in the way you deem appropriate, knowing that we aim to expand operating margin over time, excluding acquired IPR&D and develop in milestone charges. Our Q1 2022 tax rate and EPS include a favorable impact from the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year is unchanged and assumed that this provision will be deferred or repealed over Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year then we would expect the reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. It is notable that while this provision favorably impacts certain tax items, which decreased our effective tax rate, we expect it will increase our 2022 cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.5 billion. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.70 to now be in the range of $7.3 per share to $7.45 per share and lower our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.30. That $0.35 reduction are non-core -- in our non-GAAP EPS range includes the 55% decrease due to the year-to-date acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, partially offset by improved business performance of $0.20 attributable to the net benefit of Q1 bebtelovimab sales and increased investments in R&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today\u2019s exciting announcement. The positive topline results from the tirzepatide SURMOUNT-1 Phase III study. Participants without Type 2 diabetes who have obesity, or overweight with at least one co-morbidity achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 52 pounds. Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicines to deliver more than 20% weight loss on average in a Phase III study. Indeed most people on 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams of tirzepatide in this trial achieved 20% or greater weight loss and up to 63% of patients on 15 milligrams achieved this level of weight reduction. Obesity is a chronic disease that needs more effective treatment options to patients. We are working hard at Lilly to create new potentially innovative medicines, with the aim to modernize how this disease is approached. We hope that there is appetite can be Lilly\u2019s first such medicine and the SURMOUNT program has been designed to test just that. I will cover the SURMOUNT-1 results in more detail, but first let me quickly provide an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across six studies, four of which are global registration studies. On slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for those four global registration studies. All four studies compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo to provide weight reduction and safety data for people without Type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least one co-morbidity. SURMOUNT-2 will provide weight reduction and safety data for people with obesity or overweight with Type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program. And SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. We expect the remaining three global studies to read out in the middle of 2023. Note that dose escalation in the SURMOUNT program is consistent with that of the SURPASS program for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide. Patients start with 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide and move up every four weeks in 2.5 milligram increments to reach their target dose. In SURMOUNT-3 and 4, study participants who escalate go into the maximum-tolerated dose of either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, patients escalating the maximum-tolerated dose provides opportunity to evaluate the full potential for weight reduction. Studies vary in duration from 72 weeks to 82 weeks -- 72 weeks to 88 weeks and SURMOUNT-1 will continue through 176 weeks to evaluate whether tirzepatide can actually slow the time to onset of Type 2 diabetes in participants who had pre-diabetes at the time of entering the clinical trial. We believe this will be important additional information for patients and physicians. SURMOUNT-1, a large trial which enrolled over 2500 participants met its co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all pre-specified key secondary endpoints. On slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-1 study, where tirzepatide delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight. With a mean baseline weight across the study of 231 pounds, this translates into a mean body weight reduction of 52 pounds on the 15 milligram treatment arm of the study. Along with the impressive results from the 10 milligram dose, which showed 21.4% mean body weight reduction, we were also very pleased to see how well the 5 milligram performed with a 16% mean body weight reduction also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimate. Moving to slide 15. Tirzepatide obviously achieve the second co-primary endpoint of driving at least 5% weight reduction, clearly the vast majority of subjects, including greater than 96% of participants in the 10-milligram and 15-milligram arms achieved this level of weight reduction. We are really excited that a key secondary endpoint is SURMOUNT-1 showed up to 60% of patients achieved at least 20% body weight reduction at 72 weeks, again using the efficacy estimate. This is compared to only 1% for participants who achieved greater than 20% weight loss on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Moving to slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-1 study. Tirzepatide was well-tolerated in study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for the treatment of obesity. As in the SURPASS program, the most common reported adverse events were GI-related, generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred during dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were between 4.3% and 7.1% for tirzepatide treatment arms, compared to 2.6% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates range from roughly 14% to 16% in the tirzepatide arms compared to over 26% for placebo. The minimal weight loss seen in the placebo treatment group combined with the observed placebo discontinuation rate of 26% demonstrates the limited efficacy of diet and exercise alone and highlights the significant unmet medical need for people with this disease. We will continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-1 study data and are planning to present findings at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Of course, we plan to submit our manuscript to a top tier peer reviewed journal. As Dave mentioned earlier, obesity is a chronic disease impacting over 110 million Americans and there is great need for more effective treatment options. While our current alignment with the FDA is to complete the four SURMOUNT global registrational studies prior to submission, we believe the impressive results from SURMOUNT-1 warrant further discussion. Based on our existing robust dataset, we are looking forward to reviewing the data with the FDA and discussing the potential for an expedited path forward for this indication. Moving to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 27th and slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several other important developments since our last earnings call and I will cover these by therapeutic area. In diabetes, along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim, we are proud of the expanded indication for Jardiance as a treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which has been classified as the single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. Jardiance is now the first and only heart failure therapy to demonstrate statistically significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. We also announced the Phase III trial study in Jardiance for chronic kidney disease will stop early due to clear positive efficacy. The recommendation was made by an independent data monitoring committee and while we have not yet seen results from this interim analysis, we are excited about the potential for this new indication and expect to share detailed results from the upcoming primary analysis at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Last month, we began dosing patients in the first of five Phase III trials for investigational weekly insulin basal insulin FC or BIF. The trial compares weekly BIF to insulin degludec where patients are currently treated with basal insulin. We intend to start the other four Phase III trials later this year. You also see we have advanced our long-acting Amylin receptor agonist to Phase I development in obesity. Shifting to immunology, we presented mirikizumab induction data from LUCENT-1 at the Europeans Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Virtual Congress, demonstrating superiority over placebo for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. These data show patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis achieved statistically superior rates of clinical remission compared to patients taking placebo, with nearly two-thirds of patients responding to mirikizumab. The results indicated improved symptom relief, including decreased bowel urgency and resolution or near resolution of inflammation. Building upon the positive outcomes from LUCENT-1, we look forward to sharing maintenance data from LUCENT-2 later in Q2. We are also excited to announce that we have submitted to the FDA and expect submissions in Europe and Japan in Q2. Mirikizumab has the potential to be the first-in-class L-23p19 inhibitor treatment for people with ulcerative colitis. Last month at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, we shared lebrikizumab monotherapy data showing more than 50% of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced at least 75% reduction in disease severity at 16 weeks. Additionally, at the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference, we shared data showing 70% of patients receiving lebrikizumab combined with topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75% improvement in overall disease severity. We believe these data could help establish a competitive profile for lebrikizumab and we are looking forward to further data from our maintenance studies in the first half of this year to provide insight into the durability of efficacy. Global submissions are expected by year end. Moving to baricitinib. The FDA review for alopecia areata is underway and we are pleased to note that the FDA has granted priority review designation. As expected, we also received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib atopic dermatitis indication, as we were not in alignment with the agency on the indicated population. Finally, in immunology, we have discontinued the Phase II study for IL-2 in all sort of colitis to do a lack of efficacy based on interim analysis. The safety was consistent with that observed in previous studies and this decision does not impact the ongoing or planned studies for IL-2 in SLE or atopic dermatitis, as each disease state evaluates a different clinical hypothesis. Moving on to neuroscience. In the National Coverage Determination issued earlier this month for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid. We share the disappointment of patients and their caregivers, with this NCD, and we know more generally that the innovation in new medical areas really always starts with data that are less proven and more debated, and may proceed initially through regulatory mechanisms such as accelerated approval. We believe that Medicure\u2019s decision to CED in such circumstances is in conflict with FDA\u2019s and Congress\u2019s intent of expedited regulatory pathways and is likely to have a stifling effect on innovation for new medical areas, causing harm to patients that are waiting and in need of new medicines. That said, we are continuing with our rolling submission to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We intend to complete our initial submission yet in Q2, enabling a potential regulatory decision in early 2023. We believe it would be beneficial for donanemab to obtain accelerated approval proximal to the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III readout in mid 2023, which would enable parallel discussions with CMS regarding outright coverage and expedited review time for full FDA approval. We believe that given the thoughtful and robust design of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, if the study is positive, it should meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS in the NCD decision. At that time, we will advocate for CMS to reconsider outright coverage of donanemab. As we have stated previously, it\u2019s inconceivable to us that one substantial evidence of clinical benefit has been established for any Alzheimer\u2019s medicine, people with the disease won\u2019t have access to it. Our view of the mid- and long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Shifting now to oncology with pirtobrutinib. We are also working on a rolling submission here under the accelerated approval pathway. In this case for mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we also expect to complete our initial submission in Q2. We received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the submission for sintilimab, which was in line with our expectation after the Oncology -- Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting earlier this year. Along with Innovent, we are assessing next steps for sintilimab in the U.S. Further in the oncology pipeline, we started two additional Phase III studies. The first is an additional study evaluating Verzenio in HR positive HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant following progression on a CDK46 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. The second is CYCLONE 3, evaluating Verzenio in earlier lines of prostate cancer. We have also advanced our next generation RET inhibitor to Phase I development and we have discontinued our Aurora A kinase inhibitor as we did not see sufficient monotherapy activity to warrant further development. Similarly, in our pain therapeutic area, we have decided to discontinue development of EPIREG and TGF Alpha, because it did not meet criteria for proceeding. Finally, as Dave mentioned earlier, the FDA authorized bebtelovimab for emergency use for certain non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Bebtelovimab neutralizes OMICRON including the BA2 sub limit -- lineage as demonstrated by sudo virus and authentic virus neutralization assays. As you can see, Q1 was another busy, but successful quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I will turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we have made this year. We delivered solid sales growth, driven largely by volume from our key growth products, which represent 61% of our core business. We continue to see opportunity for meaningful operating margin expansion over time, excluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. We made significant progress developing new medicines with exciting advances, including for Jardiance and HFpEF, the EUA Authorization for bebtelovimab, the submission of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis, as well as positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in obesity and Jardiance in chronic kidney disease. Finally, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We are committed to invest for the long term to advance promising R&D opportunities and support launches to bring groundbreaking therapies to patients diagnosed with some of the most challenging diseases facing human kind, like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer, cancer and autoimmune disorders. With the progress we have seen to-date, we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth prospects. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible, so we ask that you limit your questions to two per caller. Luis [ph], please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we are ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Louise Chen. Please go ahead and she is from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Hi. Congratulations on the SURMOUNT data and thanks for taking my questions here. So I do want to ask you more in tirzepatide and SURMOUNT. How do you see the market landscape for obesity changing in light of your positive SURMOUNT data today? Is there an opportunity to file for that indication with the data and what\u2019s the larger opportunity for you here, is it Type 2 diabetes or obesity? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Louise. We will go to Mike Mason for those.\nMike Mason: All right. Louise, thanks for the compliment upfront. We appreciate that. I think the market opportunity is, kind of remains what we thought before, we see it as a sizable opportunity and when we look at the just the massive numbers of people who live with obesity over 100 million people in the U.S., 650 million people globally contributes a burden of over $1 trillion globally. We do think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. It should be perceived as a -- and treated as a chronic illness. It not only has health implications. But if you live with obesity, it\u2019s a very visible disease unlike others that really brings with it some unfortunate stigma into society that really hurts individuals both physically and emotionally. And so there is a need to treat this disease. The market is not going to develop overnight. We have to increase awareness that this is a chronic disease that needs to be treated. We do need to establish and grow the access for it. So we are looking long-term to this. I think it\u2019s important for us to be able to build the foundation, build the knowledge that this is a chronic disease, get that appreciated by healthcare professionals and payers and then grow the market. So we are going to look long-term. We are investing obviously not only in tirzepatide but early -- many early assets, because we do think this is a need in the marketplace that we need to focus on, and obviously, we are quite delighted by SURMOUNT-1, not only the high dose. I mean, obviously, when we saw the 52 pounds of weight loss at the high dose on average, we were wowed by that, but I am also as excited about the 16% weight loss at the 5 milligram, because everyone -- we look at the averages, but there is no averages out there. Every individual is different and we need to have a medication that at different doses offer different weight loss and so I am very pleased about the dose profile and the weight loss profile across all the doses. As Dan said, we have originally on the -- on your filing question, we have aligned with the FDA on four trials for the SURMOUNT-1, 2, 3 and 4 program. But given the huge market need and given this data, we do think it warrants a discussion with the FDA about whether we can find a path to accelerate it to the marketplace to meet this need. The SURMOUNT-1 data is great. We also have over 4,000 patients in the SURPASS-5 Global Restoration studies that provides a lot of good information on the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in the diabetes population to go along with SURMOUNT-1. So we look forward to that conversation. I think when we -- when you look at, I think your last question was, are we more excited about diabetes and obesity. I think we are equally excited about both of them. Obviously, we will focus our attention on diabetes first, still a huge massive unmet need. We have unfortunately only half of people who live with Type 2 diabetes in good control. So we will focus on that and then we will focus long term on obesity as I have said earlier. So thanks for the question. Thanks for the compliments. Appreciate it.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Louise, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Let me offer my congratulations as well on the SURMOUNT-1 data. I have two questions. The first is just based on the timing of the acceptance of the tirzepatide BLA for diabetes, it seems like we are passed the window for the FDA to convene an AdCom panel. So just wondering if you agree or if the door is still open there? And then I was just wondering, probably a question for Mike, if you could share your latest perspective on commercial positioning of tirzepatide. Is this going to be a single brand or two separate brands and then how are you thinking early on, just high level thoughts about pricing here, is this going to be based on dose level or fixed as is with Trulicity? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Terence. We will go to Mike for both those questions.\nMike Mason: Okay. Thanks for the question. I will answer your second question first on kind of our commercial positioning. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we will keep that to ourselves at this time, know that we will focus on maximizing the opportunity long-term in diabetes and obesity and we will make the right moves whether that\u2019s one or two brands. We will have dialogs with the FDA on the one versus two brands and it\u2019s too early to talk about that at this point. With regards to the AdCom, we don\u2019t anticipate an AdCom for tirzepatide.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Terence, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGeoff Meacham: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Also want to offer my congrats on the data. Just had a few on the obesity opportunity. Dan, a question for you, the market gating factor still looks to be reimbursement and access and I think that prevailing wisdom is that an outcome study will be needed. So, first, do you agree with that, and second, is if you do, how are you guys thinking about the size and scope of obesity outcome study? I wasn\u2019t sure if there is a benefit, of a point estimate of a benefit that you think could help drive reimbursement or for example bariatric surgery was a reasonable reference point? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. We will go to Dan and then, Mike, also invite you to weigh in on our MMO study.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks. Of course, we believe and there is really quite a bit of evidence that weight loss will lead to really strong benefits in outcomes across a variety of diseases. Obviously, cardiovascular disease is near the top of the list, but many others as well. We know a lot from bariatric surgery, which has shown that it can reverse Type 2 diabetes or prevent the onset of diabetes. It can reduce cardiovascular risk. It can decrease even mortality when you get weight loss. That\u2019s really in the range of what we saw in this trial. So we are excited about the potential to change those outcomes. Of course, as you point out, we have to demonstrate that. We will do that over time. But given where we are in our understanding of this disease process and given the depth of unmet medical need in obesity, I don\u2019t see that data as a gating factor for user reimbursement of the drug. Maybe Mike can offer more details on that.\nKevin Hern: Mike?\nMike Mason: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. Thanks and thanks for the compliments on the data. Yeah. The -- I wouldn\u2019t look backwardly at the fact that with that obesity agents up to this point really haven\u2019t been able to secure good access, at the weight loss levels that you were seeing 5%, 6%, 7% weight loss. No one was able to produce or no one has produced health outcome benefits at that level of weight loss. So it makes sense for payers not opening access for those probably more cosmetic than true health benefits. But if you are looking at a product like tirzepatide that can deliver up to 22.5% weight loss, we do believe and there\u2019s good data out there to suggest that\u2019s going to really improve and lead to the good health outcomes. We have to produce that over time and we will do that. But I don\u2019t think that will limit us from gaining access in the meantime. I think when you look at novel access [inaudible] under at 20 million, 25 million, people who live with obesity in the U.S. having access. So I think we can continue to build on that. I think there was a real big win for obesity access recently with the Federal Health employees gaining access for obesity agents. So I think that\u2019s a important trend. Also understand that we are -- we have -- we are dedicated to produce a series of trials that we hope will demonstrate and we expect to demonstrate good outcomes with tirzepatide for sleep apnea, HFpEF, as well as our outcome study that will include cardiovascular. Now those are indications right now that do have access. So both Part D you take sleep apnea, for example, that has good coverage in both commercial and Part D. So we do expect that we show good outcomes there that for those people who have obesity and sleep apnea that we should be able to gain access for it. So we think we do believe that access will start off and where it is today and grow it over time. But we are committed long-term to build access and help people who live with obesity for the duration.\nGeoff Meacham: Great. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. Thanks, Mike, and Dan. Thanks, Geoff, for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nChris Schott: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the data as well. Do you -- I guess a couple of questions on tirzepatide. At first, do you see weight loss plateauing in the study, and if so, when did it plateau and then do you expect patients will stay on the drug once they have lost weight? I am trying to sense of just how you are thinking about duration of tirzepatide in obesity? The second question was on an accelerated filing in obesity. Just any clarity of when we could get more details on that? And then, finally, on the pre-diabetic progression to diabetes endpoint from SURMOUNT-1, I guess could diabetes prevention become a labeled indication or is this just more data that could come on label? Thanks so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for all those questions.\nMike Mason: Okay. I think that may have been more than two, but I will go through these pretty quickly. So, first of all, weight loss plateauing. I think we have to leave some of the data for our medical meetings coming up. So I will reserve that for that. We do believe that this is a chronic illness that requires a chronic treatment. So we do believe people will need to stay on the drug long-term in order to get the benefit. And then pre-diabetes, I look at that as an important population that tirzepatide could provide health outcomes for, so probably more about showing data where our segment could benefit from it versus having a labeled indication for it.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike.\nMike Mason: And then -- okay.\nKevin Hern: Sorry.\nMike Mason: Go ahead.\nDave Ricks: Go ahead.\nKevin Hern: Next caller, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next caller is Andrew Baum from Citi. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Baum: Yeah. Thank you. Couple of questions, please. The long-term commercial potential diabetes helped by the co-morbidities, I mean, clearly, is there and I am sure it will be realized by you and your competitors. Could you comment rather on the trajectory near-term? You referenced the covered that novo has attained. But obviously they had a very expensive bridge program during that period, which makes it difficult to extrapolate what the real reimburse demand is. Separately, we are hearing that PBMs pushing back those patients that converted from the bridge to reimburse. So any comments you have on that will be helpful. And then, second, we had two late-stage failures with given you have first now at least in Phase III, as well as obviously having Verzenio. How are you thinking about how this impacts your development of your SERD program?\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Andrew. We will go to Mike for the first one on the trajectory in obesity and then Jake for the question around SERD.\nMike Mason: Yeah. As I said earlier, I do think it\u2019s going to be one that you are not going to probably spur now the gate on that. You will have a sizable segment but one that will grow over time. We will provide supportive care bridging programs, as you say at launch to make sure and support people so they can have a good experience and see the benefit to the weight loss. But we do think it\u2019s something that this is one that I would look at the obesity market, one that will establish, it will be decent size, but it will grow for the next decade or two.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Jake ?\nJake Van Naarden: Yeah. Thanks for the question about SERDs. Our view of our program in the landscape hasn\u2019t really changed all that much in light of the recent announcements. Obviously, as it relates to the two most recent trial readouts, we have yet to see the actual data, though at least in one case there were some directional clues given by company management. I think largely speaking we saw those studies as sort of underpowered Phase II trials, and I think in many cases, what we are hearing qualitatively from those companies suggests exactly that. In other words, trends in the right direction but underpowered studies. Our initial second lines randomized trial that we are recruiting right now is a fully powered Phase III study. So if anything, we are actually more confident in that study winning than we were previously. But that\u2019s not really the -- that may be the first path to market for the agent and impactful for those patients In the late-line setting, but that\u2019s not really the ultimate I think most impactful place for the medicine, which is really in the adjuvant setting and we are working on the trial design there that we will talk more about later this year.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Jake. Andrew, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks for the questions and congrats on the data. Just a quick question, Dan, this is a very large Phase III program that you are conducting for obesity and more broadly, but the statement that you will be pursuing a potential faster path to market with regulatory authorities on the basis of SURMOUNT-1 data is, it\u2019s certainly intriguing. How do you see the likelihood of success and is the real separation there the 20% threshold, do you really think that\u2019s the potential game changer or is it something else in the data that we have yet to see that you think is unique and compelling? And then, separately, just wanted to follow up on the -- your comments on the Alzheimer\u2019s side of things. I think you have said in the past that there are some issues as it relates to how we think about the impact or thoughts around other clinical trials. I am wondering how you are feeling along those lines and really just wanted to get your general sort of compare and contrast of the Lilly program versus some of those -- some of the other two programs that are coming later this year? Thanks.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Seamus. We will go to Dan for both of those.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Okay. Sure. Seamus, I mean, let me start with tirzepatide and sort of the comments that I made on the regulatory path. The FDA has clear guidance on what\u2019s required to get an indication for anti-obesity drug and those guidance documents form the basis of our previous discussions in alignment with the agency. Our base case based on those has been and really continues to be the submission will require the full package of Phase III data from this trial -- from this program. On the other hand, as I said, I think, we were impressed and delighted with the data that we got from SURMOUNT-1. It\u2019s a very large Phase III trial as you pointed out and there are a number of elements here that encouraged us to open the door for additional discussion with the FDA. You asked what is it specifically. Maybe I will highlight two or three things. First, the efficacy, as you pointed out, the more than 20% weight loss is really unprecedented level of weight loss in the field and I think that\u2019s exciting for patients and addressing a very significant unmet medical need. Second is the safety and tolerability data that we got. I think there is a pleasant surprise there if you look at how well tolerated this drug was, how few discontinuations we had, and as I pointed out, more discontinuations for treatment on placebo made more than on the active arms of the drug, just indicating that people tolerate this why I want to stay on the drug and appreciate the weight loss benefits they are getting. So the very good safety and tolerability profile that we are seeing, combined with the extraordinary efficacy profile, I think, is a major step in that argument. The last piece, of ,course is that we don\u2019t see this data in isolation. This builds on a very significant Type 2 diabetes program, which of course, involves many patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity and demonstrated safety and efficacy in that setting as well. So we will see how that goes and I think to circle back to Chris\u2019 question, when do we learn more, as we have discussions with regulators. If we learn more and we see that there is an opportunity for expedited path here, we will be as forthcoming with investors as possible. Your second question here was around Alzheimer\u2019s and where we are thinking about our profile versus competitors and when those competitor readouts, what are we going to be looking at. I think we have a number of design elements in TRAILBLAZER 2 that we spoke about previously that we think could be very important, probably, starting with our use of biomarkers to select patients not just amyloid positivity, but also win doing in on patients with intermediate tau levels. So these aren\u2019t patients who have too much tau in the brain, because we think there beyond the point where anti-amyloid drugs will help them nor are they patients with no tau in the brain because we think those patients won\u2019t progress even on placebo, and therefore, won\u2019t get benefit from a drug. So we think selecting those patients will give us the opportunity to see better efficacy in a more homogenous background. Second, we think we have a drug that lowers amyloid faster and to a steeper degree and that should translate to improved benefits. And then third is some of the statistical differences in our analysis plan focusing on a composited measure ADRS, which we are excited about and things should be more highly powered to see a larger effect size. So all of those things combined lead us to a point where even if competitors trials are negative, and I think, there\u2019s a reasonable chance one or both could be, we won\u2019t be discouraged. What I expect to see though is when we look at the totality of data from competitor readouts prior to ours, we will see evidence that lowering amyloid in general is having a positive effect on solving cognition and function. Even if some trials on some endpoints at some time points hit or don\u2019t hit statistical significance, I think it\u2019s that totality data that will encourage us, and then as I said, our trial\u2019s designed to hit. So that\u2019s what we are hoping for and that\u2019s what we expect middle of next year.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Seamus, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlice Nettleton: Hi. Thank for taking my questions and congrats on the data. This is Alice Nettleton on for Tim Anderson. Hey, just on tirzepatide, so based on your product and novo to the go, the weight loss is impressive, but with based products that still about 30% to 40% of patients who placebo who don\u2019t achieve at least 5% weight reduction, which is quite a high percentage and it almost seems to suggest a resistance mechanism of some sort to circular. So is there any mechanistic rationale or predictability for those who don\u2019t respond? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. We will go to Dan for the question.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think you are right, in past studies of different medications for weight loss. There have been a lot of patients who didn\u2019t respond. That\u2019s not the case with tirzepatide. So we are really delighted that at the 10 milligram and 15 milligram dose, more than 96% of patients had at least 5% weight loss. So this drug is working to some extent in the vast majority of patients in this trial and nearly two-thirds of the patients at the highest dose are getting 20% weight loss, which is really a life-changing level. So I think you are right. Patients are -- have variable degrees of resistance to anti-obesity mechanisms. But I also think that this combination of GIP and GLP that we have in tirzepatide is such a powerful mechanism that it overcomes those resistant patients for the most part. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Alice, thanks for your question. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Umer Raffat from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and by the way, congrats on the data. It\u2019s how I maintain my physique. Well, I am joking. So, donanemab, I have two questions. One, have you been able to finalize the stack line with FDA? And also given your confidence in donanemab, I am curious why it would not make sense to have a CDR Sum of the Boxes endpoint in there in TRAILBLAZER for the head-to-head versus. And then, separately, just a quick one, I noticed your slides mentioned the IL-2 conjugate in ulcerative colitis has been removed and I couldn\u2019t tell if it\u2019s being discontinued in that because this trial is barely started less than six months ago. So just thought I should clarify. Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks. We will go to Dan for all those questions.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Sure. So let me start with the Alzheimer\u2019s questions. I think we have been public about our stats plan. I think the focus on ADRS is well warranted by all of the data that we have collected by a pretty detailed statistical analysis, many of which have been published on past trials, which just show this is an outcome that performs better from a statistical perspective then things like CDR Sum of Boxes, while still capturing both function and cognition. So CDR is noisy and also appears unreliable. If you look across sister studies, for example, the two solanezumab studies or the two aducanumab studies, CDR Sum of Boxes can move in opposite directions in different studies whereas ADLs and ADAS-Cog, the two components of ADRS are much more reliable, move together show consistent effects. So that\u2019s where we are, I think it\u2019s an evolution of endpoints and we will do our best to justify that with regulators once we have our data. Why wouldn\u2019t we have CDR Sum of Boxes was the second part question. Well, of course, we do. It\u2019s -- will be a gated secondary for sure, and I think from our perspective, the worst case scenario is that we are held to achieving ADRS and CDR Sum of Boxes. That\u2019s okay. If that happens, I hope and expect that we will have a good chance to hit CDR Sum of Boxes. But, of course, we are going to put what we see is the least noisy, most reliable, most formative endpoint first in our statistical analysis, which is ADRS. With respect to IL-2, you are right. This was a pretty fast in and out in ulcerative colitis. We were pleased to enroll this Phase II study pretty quickly. We triggered interim analysis based on a certain number of patients with a certain amount of follow up and based on that analysis and pre-specified criteria, we do not see enough efficacy to proceed. So it fail that futility analysis. We dropped that indication, wind down that particular study in ulcerative colitis, but two other indications persist.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Umer, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: Next caller is Steve Scala from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nSteve Scala: Thank you. A couple of questions. The SURMOUNT-1 data was very impressive, but not a huge surprise. It must have been considered as a likely scenario by Lilly, yet Lilly\u2019s filing strategy has shifted. So, just to be clear, has FDA or other regulatory body encouraged Lilly to file early based on the SURMOUNT-1 results? So that\u2019s the first question. Second question is, were there any inventory movements or other unusual movements in the quarter? It seems that a number of your key drivers just missed at least our thinking. So I am wondering if it was inventory movements that accounted for that? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Steve. We will go to Dan for the regulatory question then Anat for the question on inventory.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: All right. Steve, I think, you said, it\u2019s not a surprise. I think there are some things here that are quite a bit more positive than maybe most people would have expected. Certainly, the level of efficacy here that was achieved was I think higher than most expectations, as well as the tolerability. So the adverse events from nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, lower probably than what most people would have expected treatment discontinuations particularly lower. So I think on the whole, we have a data package that does exceed expectations. So it\u2019s really at the top end of the range of what we thought might be possible for a drug tirzepatide. So we are excited about that. Specifically, you are asking about regulatory interactions. We usually don\u2019t want to get into like back and forth on and things like that. But just to be clear, as I said before, our alignment with the FDA was around submitting when the full package is complete, and have not had discussions yet about what other options might exist in light of the state.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anat?\nAnat Ashkenazi: So for the dynamics in Q1, we typically see dynamic associated with inventory build at the end of each calendar year in December and then following by inventory burn typically in the first quarter of each year. We saw the same dynamic here this year. We saw an impact on Trulicity and a number of other products, which you may be seeing in as you are looking at the year-on-year comparison. The other element, if you are looking at Taltz from a year-on-year perspective, we did see in Q1 in comparison to Q1 of 2021 reduction in script size. As you recall, last year we had -- we started our contract with ESI and the loading dose with associate with multiple devices that each patient started on. So this quarter we are just seeing a reduction associated with that year-on-year comparison.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anat. Steve, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is the Vamil Divan from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nVamil Divan: Great. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe a couple more on the obesity side, if I could. So one, you mentioned the Amylin agonist that you have moved in the Phase I here. Can you just maybe talk about that? Is that maybe more of an insurance policy against four competitors you are working on, or do you expect Amylin could maybe come with some mechanisms additional efficacy and that was overseeing now with the blips and lots of issues at the time? And then, second, you talked about this a little bit before around the discontinuation and the duration. So can you just remind us what the current duration or average duration of therapy is with Trulicity and then maybe if you have any sort of current something that how you want or when you think patient may end up staying in a product like yourself? But then given the -- I think the superior profile, we are seeing for that either for diabetes and/or obesity? Thank you so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Vamil. We will go to Dan for the question on kind of early phase obesity and then we will go to Mike for the question around Trulicity duration and implications in obesity.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks, Vamil. You are asking about our long-acting Amylin agonist here. We have been interested in biology of other incretins and incretin like pathways for many years, maybe a decade now or more. Amylin is one of those pathways. We have worked on dual Amylin calcitonin receptor agonist. This is a pure Amylin agonist. We are exploring these and other similar mechanisms as complements likely to tirzepatide. I don\u2019t expect any of these mechanisms to offer this kind of weight loss, 22.5% weight loss. But I think it may be for some patients who desire even additional weight loss that you could stack one of these mechanisms on top of tirzepatide. But clearly, we have raised the bar and we will look through our Phase I and Phase II portfolio now with even higher criteria for progressing. I think to a new weight loss mechanism now is going to have to be in the very high 20s I think to be an exciting advance beyond tirzepatide. Maybe adding something to tirzepatide could accomplish that and offer the majority of patient\u2019s efficacy similar even better to a bariatric surgery. That\u2019s the next frontier.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Mike?\nMike Mason: Yeah. Thanks for the questions. A very good question. The -- when you look at diabetes versus obesity, it\u2019s hard to compare, I think, to suggest that because the nature of the diseases that you will have like similar discontinuation rates or our length of therapy. When you look at when someone starts Trulicity in Type 2 diabetes, they only have a fraction of the beta cell health of someone who is normal before the onset and the run-up of pre-diabetes and diabetes has lowered the functioning of the beta cell and so what you have in diabetes is that beta cell health continues to decline and then at some point, you may have to go on insulin. We don\u2019t believe that it will have that same dynamic and obesity that the effect of weight loss with someone who lives with obesity is not going to have that same effect of kind of wearing off with the beta cell health that you see for Trulicity and our GLPs in diabetes. So we do believe that the weight loss will be more durable and that patients will be well motivated to stay on therapy. That said, it will be an area of focus for us to make sure that we learn why people stop taking obesity agents and we will do whatever we can to support patients during the entire length of therapy.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Vamil, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Justin [ph] on for Carter. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all these exciting updates today. The first one looking at read throughs to heart failure. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the implications of this amount data on the ongoing summit study, given the weight loss is a predictor of outcomes there. Does the magnitude of weight loss that today increase your confidence in the outcomes of that study and then are there any interim analysis, we should be looking for at the summit?\nKevin Hern: Okay. Thank you. We will go to Mike for those questions on summit.\nMike Mason: Yeah. I mean, good question. I mean I think the strength of the SURMOUNT-1 data makes us confidence in the entire tirzepatide Phase III program for all indications and so, obviously, our hypothesis, one of the hypothesis was weight loss would help individuals with HFpEF, and obviously SURMOUNT-1 supported that. So we are confident in our HFpEF program for tirzepatide. I don\u2019t believe we have, and maybe Dan can lead into that question, off the top of my head, but I do believe we have any interim readouts on our heart failure study.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Mike, I -- we usually try not to disclose potential interims\u2026\nMike Mason: Yeah.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: \u2026 to preserve the integrity of the study. So sometimes we build those options and sometimes, we are not. But I totally agree that this weight loss sort of at the high end of expectations, as I said earlier, it\u2019s just got to increase our confidence in HFpEF. And of course, as we dig deeper, we will look at a number of biomarkers in the study, which could further inform cardiovascular benefits.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan, and Mike. Justin, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nKerry Holford: Oh! Hi. Thanks for taking questions. Please, another one just tirzepatide first. So is the compelling data today enabled an earlier filing in obesity, are you also now hoping to secure a quick review? Do you think that that was so you could get that as a supplementary filing or perhaps you would look to use the PLP that you purchased this quarter and can you also just confirm exact PDUFA date for the diabetes filing? And then my second question for you, Anat, on IPR&D and guidance. Clearly this cost could evolve yet if you make further acquisitions, collaborations and so. But can we expect you to provide visibility at the start of each year on what extent, what level of milestones you believe Eli Lilly will make in the year ahead? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Kerry. We will go to Dan for the questions around regulatory filing around tirzepatide and then again to Anat on IPR&D and guidance.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kerry. Just to clarify, we didn\u2019t announce plans for an early filing, we just said, we are moving to the next step and discussing options with regulators. You are right we do have a PR that we have repurchased. We are excited to have a portfolio with -- rich with opportunities, both new molecular entities, as well as the new indications such as the obesity indication. We will choose based on regulatory path that are available to us and unmet medical needs and competition, of course, what\u2019s the best opportunities that factor on.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. Anat?\nAnat Ashkenazi: Kerry, so on the IPR&D charges, while we are now building them into our non-GAAP actuals and we will provide information not just on the quarterly results, but anything, any business development transactions that have been signed between the end of the quarter in our earnings call. But you -- if you look even at our numbers from last year, these numbers are highly variable and highly unpredictable. So you can move from 40 million in one quarter to 400 million in another quarter or even zero. And when we issue guidance, it is practically impossible for us to provide any detailed view on what those charges will be, not knowing what business development transaction we will be signing. So what we will do is, as we have those, we will provide that information to the investment community every quarter. Typically if it\u2019s associated with the large business development transaction there will be a press release associated with it within the quarter. So you will be able to see and track that. But providing it as part of guidance is challenging, practically impossible actually to predict these.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anat. And Kerry had a question on the Type 2 diabetes PDUFA. We don\u2019t give PDUFA dates. We announce it in the quarter when we submitted it. But we -- as we said, we expect that by midyear. Thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Evan Seigerman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I would love to know if you have any additional color to why we saw a higher discontinuation rate in the mid-dose of tirzepatide data. And then more broadly speaking, when you think about in the market between Trulicity and potentially tirzepatide, do you expect to switch patients over, how do you expect this two assets to coexist assuming approval of tirzepatide? Thank you so much.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Evan. We will go to Dan for the first question around tolerability discontinuations and then, Mike, for the second one on Trulicity and tirzepatide.\nDr. Dan Skovronsky: Yeah. Thanks. In this study, the tolerability of the 10 milligram and 15 milligram doses were pretty similar. So it\u2019s not surprising the treatment discontinuation rates could have been pretty similar. Of course, there is a little bit more efficacy on the 15 milligram dose, which is important driver to stay on therapy. So probably see the balance of tolerability and efficacy playing out a little bit better, perhaps, in the 15 milligram and the 10 milligram. But these are all pretty small rates of discontinuation, if you look at sort of mid single-digit rates of discontinuation for AEs. So that\u2019s really great. I think better than expected.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Dan. And Mike, on Trulicity and tirzepatide marketing thoughts?\nMike Mason: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our focus is going to be growing the class, as well as growing our share of market in the class. We will try to maximize the opportunity for our entire incretin portfolio. I mean what\u2019s most important is not necessarily switches for molecules, existing products, but more the new patients that are coming on into the incretin class and winning those new patients. And so, I think over time, we will get a mix between new patient starts and switches from other GLPs. But I think primarily, our focus is going to be on really driving tirzepatide wins of new patients coming into the class and so that will be our approach going forward.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike, and Dan. Evan, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nChris Shibutani: Thank you. Two questions, if I may on tirzepatide and the potential for read across from Novo\u2019s outcome study that is the next data point I think in terms of thinking about the progress of this ultimate opportunity. Can you frame for us what you think would be your expectations and maybe level set what you think would be a bar there? I know that you mentioned that you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessarily a gating factor. That would be helpful. Second question on the post-final NCD for donanemab and the language that CMS used, do you have clarity from perhaps post the final NCD that your current program will adequately address what they believe to be sort of structural requirements for the kinds of studies that need to be conducted in order for CMS to contemplate full reimbursement of Alzheimer\u2019s therapy? Thank you.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Chris. We will go to Mike for just the thoughts on outcome studies in the competitive landscape there in obesity, and then Anne for the question on the NCD in the donanemab.\nMike Mason: Yeah. Good question. We touched on this a little bit early, but I think, the -- we expect the Step CV study to be successful given the expected weight loss and what he has expressed. We think that will be important to continue to grow the class and for some payers winning access on it. So we hope that the Step program is successful, we expect it will be, and obviously, we have a very comprehensive Phase III program to demonstrate outcomes for obesity, we also are confident in.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Mike. Anne?\nAnne White: Yeah. Thanks for the question on donanemab. So, as Dan mentioned, our priority will be to advocate for reconsideration with the TB-2 Phase III data. So we do remain confident in donanemab and believe that TB-2 and our overall TRAILBLAZER program have extensive data and so as we review the requirements in the NCD, we believe our data should be sufficient to meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS if TB-2 as positive. Obviously, we will need to review this data with CMS and gain their agreement. So we will do that very quickly. Our intention is as soon as we have that data to request reconsideration for national coverage and we believe that having two positive pivotal trials should meet that high level of evidence. As far as CMS, we have engaged with them throughout the process and so we will continue to do so moving forward. And there\u2019s a number of statements in the NCD that we will see clarity on to gain additional clarity as we move forward. But, yes, we do believe that we should meet that high level of evidence, but pending those discussions with CMS.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Anne. Chris, thanks for your questions. Next caller, please.\nOperator: The next caller is Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nRobyn Karnauskas: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and I guess I will keep going on the tirzepatide route. So a lot of you will have question in the duration of therapy. Have you talked to payers about once you reach a point, where maybe some of your co-morbidities are gone and you are on drug, if they are going to be still reimbursed therapy? And then the second question for you is, like, when you think about this data now that you have in-house is very robust. What new trials might you think about or new indications whether it would be obesity without comorbidities or other indications might you want to start, now that you sort of have this in-house and it\u2019s clear? Thanks.\nKevin Hern: Thanks, Robyn. We will go to Mike for both of those questions.\nMike Mason: Yeah. Good questions. And when we are having discussions with payers, they do -- they are excited about the obesity class, if we can demonstrate outcomes. And if they have a patient who has seen benefits from an anti-obesity medication, they actually want to work with us to make sure that those individual stay on therapy in order to get and maintain the weight loss they have seen and so I think there will be opportunities for us to partner with payers to ensure that we can maintain individuals on chronic medications. I think our expectation is that people do need to stay on tirzepatide long term in order to get the -- and maintain the weight benefits and we will be working with payers to make sure that we can maintain that weight loss, so people can get the outcomes that they need. Second question-- remind me, Kevin, what the second question was?\nKevin Hern: Any new trials or indications as you see this data beyond what we have announced.\nMike Mason: Yeah. I mean, I think, that we are going to talk about and in today\u2019s discussion obviously we will internalize this data. We will -- this is, as we said earlier, this is an important therapeutic area for us, massive unmet needs and one that we are looking to play the long-term game on. So when you put those together, we obviously are, we will be very thoughtful and aggressive and if we do feel that there is additional need for trials on tirzepatide that can provide insights to payers and healthcare professionals, we will do those trials. Thanks for the questions.\nKevin Hern: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Robyn, for your questions. The queue is exhausted. We will go to Dave for the close.\nDave Ricks: Okay. Great. Well, thanks for joining today\u2019s earnings and tirzepatide call, I guess, and your interest, of course, in the company. It is an exciting moment for all of us. 2022 started in a similar fashion to how we ended 2021, with strong momentum across the business. We remain focused on executing our innovation based strategy, which of course, is to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. With strong commercial execution complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in today and please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call and have a great day. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Dr. Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement. The positive topline results from the tirzepatide SURMOUNT-1 Phase III study. Participants without Type 2 diabetes who have obesity, or overweight with at least one co-morbidity achieved up to 22.5% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 52 pounds. Tirzepatide is the first investigational medicines to deliver more than 20% weight loss on average in a Phase III study. Indeed most people on 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams of tirzepatide in this trial achieved 20% or greater weight loss and up to 63% of patients on 15 milligrams achieved this level of weight reduction. Obesity is a chronic disease that needs more effective treatment options to patients. We are working hard at Lilly to create new potentially innovative medicines, with the aim to modernize how this disease is approached. We hope that there is appetite can be Lilly's first such medicine and the SURMOUNT program has been designed to test just that. I will cover the SURMOUNT-1 results in more detail, but first let me quickly provide an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across six studies, four of which are global registration studies. On slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for those four global registration studies. All four studies compared the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo to provide weight reduction and safety data for people without Type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least one co-morbidity. SURMOUNT-2 will provide weight reduction and safety data for people with obesity or overweight with Type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program. And SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. We expect the remaining three global studies to read out in the middle of 2023. Note that dose escalation in the SURMOUNT program is consistent with that of the SURPASS program for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes with tirzepatide. Patients start with 2.5 milligrams of tirzepatide and move up every four weeks in 2.5 milligram increments to reach their target dose. In SURMOUNT-3 and 4, study participants who escalate go into the maximum-tolerated dose of either 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, patients escalating the maximum-tolerated dose provides opportunity to evaluate the full potential for weight reduction. Studies vary in duration from 72 weeks to 82 weeks -- 72 weeks to 88 weeks and SURMOUNT-1 will continue through 176 weeks to evaluate whether tirzepatide can actually slow the time to onset of Type 2 diabetes in participants who had pre-diabetes at the time of entering the clinical trial. We believe this will be important additional information for patients and physicians. SURMOUNT-1, a large trial which enrolled over 2500 participants met its co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all pre-specified key secondary endpoints. On slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-1 study, where tirzepatide delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction in adults with obesity or overweight. With a mean baseline weight across the study of 231 pounds, this translates into a mean body weight reduction of 52 pounds on the 15 milligram treatment arm of the study. Along with the impressive results from the 10 milligram dose, which showed 21.4% mean body weight reduction, we were also very pleased to see how well the 5 milligram performed with a 16% mean body weight reduction also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimate. Moving to slide 15. Tirzepatide obviously achieve the second co-primary endpoint of driving at least 5% weight reduction, clearly the vast majority of subjects, including greater than 96% of participants in the 10-milligram and 15-milligram arms achieved this level of weight reduction. We are really excited that a key secondary endpoint is SURMOUNT-1 showed up to 60% of patients achieved at least 20% body weight reduction at 72 weeks, again using the efficacy estimate. This is compared to only 1% for participants who achieved greater than 20% weight loss on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Moving to slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-1 study. Tirzepatide was well-tolerated in study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for the treatment of obesity. As in the SURPASS program, the most common reported adverse events were GI-related, generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred during dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were between 4.3% and 7.1% for tirzepatide treatment arms, compared to 2.6% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates range from roughly 14% to 16% in the tirzepatide arms compared to over 26% for placebo. The minimal weight loss seen in the placebo treatment group combined with the observed placebo discontinuation rate of 26% demonstrates the limited efficacy of diet and exercise alone and highlights the significant unmet medical need for people with this disease. We will continue to evaluate the SURMOUNT-1 study data and are planning to present findings at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Of course, we plan to submit our manuscript to a top tier peer reviewed journal. As Dave mentioned earlier, obesity is a chronic disease impacting over 110 million Americans and there is great need for more effective treatment options. While our current alignment with the FDA is to complete the four SURMOUNT global registrational studies prior to submission, we believe the impressive results from SURMOUNT-1 warrant further discussion. Based on our existing robust dataset, we are looking forward to reviewing the data with the FDA and discussing the potential for an expedited path forward for this indication. Moving to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 27th and slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several other important developments since our last earnings call and I will cover these by therapeutic area. In diabetes, along with our partner Boehringer Ingelheim, we are proud of the expanded indication for Jardiance as a treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which has been classified as the single largest unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. Jardiance is now the first and only heart failure therapy to demonstrate statistically significant risk reduction in cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure regardless of ejection fraction. We also announced the Phase III trial study in Jardiance for chronic kidney disease will stop early due to clear positive efficacy. The recommendation was made by an independent data monitoring committee and while we have not yet seen results from this interim analysis, we are excited about the potential for this new indication and expect to share detailed results from the upcoming primary analysis at a medical meeting in the second half of this year. Last month, we began dosing patients in the first of five Phase III trials for investigational weekly insulin basal insulin FC or BIF. The trial compares weekly BIF to insulin degludec where patients are currently treated with basal insulin. We intend to start the other four Phase III trials later this year. You also see we have advanced our long-acting Amylin receptor agonist to Phase I development in obesity. Shifting to immunology, we presented mirikizumab induction data from LUCENT-1 at the Europeans Crohn's and Colitis Virtual Congress, demonstrating superiority over placebo for the primary and all key secondary endpoints. These data show patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis achieved statistically superior rates of clinical remission compared to patients taking placebo, with nearly two-thirds of patients responding to mirikizumab. The results indicated improved symptom relief, including decreased bowel urgency and resolution or near resolution of inflammation. Building upon the positive outcomes from LUCENT-1, we look forward to sharing maintenance data from LUCENT-2 later in Q2. We are also excited to announce that we have submitted to the FDA and expect submissions in Europe and Japan in Q2. Mirikizumab has the potential to be the first-in-class L-23p19 inhibitor treatment for people with ulcerative colitis. Last month at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting, we shared lebrikizumab monotherapy data showing more than 50% of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis experienced at least 75% reduction in disease severity at 16 weeks. Additionally, at the revolutionizing atopic dermatitis conference, we shared data showing 70% of patients receiving lebrikizumab combined with topical corticosteroids achieved at least 75% improvement in overall disease severity. We believe these data could help establish a competitive profile for lebrikizumab and we are looking forward to further data from our maintenance studies in the first half of this year to provide insight into the durability of efficacy. Global submissions are expected by year end. Moving to baricitinib. The FDA review for alopecia areata is underway and we are pleased to note that the FDA has granted priority review designation. As expected, we also received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib atopic dermatitis indication, as we were not in alignment with the agency on the indicated population. Finally, in immunology, we have discontinued the Phase II study for IL-2 in all sort of colitis to do a lack of efficacy based on interim analysis. The safety was consistent with that observed in previous studies and this decision does not impact the ongoing or planned studies for IL-2 in SLE or atopic dermatitis, as each disease state evaluates a different clinical hypothesis. Moving on to neuroscience. In the National Coverage Determination issued earlier this month for monoclonal antibodies directed against amyloid. We share the disappointment of patients and their caregivers, with this NCD, and we know more generally that the innovation in new medical areas really always starts with data that are less proven and more debated, and may proceed initially through regulatory mechanisms such as accelerated approval. We believe that Medicure's decision to CED in such circumstances is in conflict with FDA's and Congress's intent of expedited regulatory pathways and is likely to have a stifling effect on innovation for new medical areas, causing harm to patients that are waiting and in need of new medicines. That said, we are continuing with our rolling submission to the FDA under the accelerated approval pathway. We intend to complete our initial submission yet in Q2, enabling a potential regulatory decision in early 2023. We believe it would be beneficial for donanemab to obtain accelerated approval proximal to the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase III readout in mid 2023, which would enable parallel discussions with CMS regarding outright coverage and expedited review time for full FDA approval. We believe that given the thoughtful and robust design of TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, if the study is positive, it should meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS in the NCD decision. At that time, we will advocate for CMS to reconsider outright coverage of donanemab. As we have stated previously, it's inconceivable to us that one substantial evidence of clinical benefit has been established for any Alzheimer's medicine, people with the disease won't have access to it. Our view of the mid- and long-term opportunity to help patients with donanemab remains unchanged. Shifting now to oncology with pirtobrutinib. We are also working on a rolling submission here under the accelerated approval pathway. In this case for mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we also expect to complete our initial submission in Q2. We received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the submission for sintilimab, which was in line with our expectation after the Oncology -- Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting earlier this year. Along with Innovent, we are assessing next steps for sintilimab in the U.S. Further in the oncology pipeline, we started two additional Phase III studies. The first is an additional study evaluating Verzenio in HR positive HER-2 negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with fulvestrant following progression on a CDK46 inhibitor and endocrine therapy. The second is CYCLONE 3, evaluating Verzenio in earlier lines of prostate cancer. We have also advanced our next generation RET inhibitor to Phase I development and we have discontinued our Aurora A kinase inhibitor as we did not see sufficient monotherapy activity to warrant further development. Similarly, in our pain therapeutic area, we have decided to discontinue development of EPIREG and TGF Alpha, because it did not meet criteria for proceeding. Finally, as Dave mentioned earlier, the FDA authorized bebtelovimab for emergency use for certain non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Bebtelovimab neutralizes OMICRON including the BA2 sub limit -- lineage as demonstrated by sudo virus and authentic virus neutralization assays. As you can see, Q1 was another busy, but successful quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I will turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks. Yeah. Thanks. Of course, we believe and there is really quite a bit of evidence that weight loss will lead to really strong benefits in outcomes across a variety of diseases. Obviously, cardiovascular disease is near the top of the list, but many others as well. We know a lot from bariatric surgery, which has shown that it can reverse Type 2 diabetes or prevent the onset of diabetes. It can reduce cardiovascular risk. It can decrease even mortality when you get weight loss. That's really in the range of what we saw in this trial. So we are excited about the potential to change those outcomes. Of course, as you point out, we have to demonstrate that. We will do that over time. But given where we are in our understanding of this disease process and given the depth of unmet medical need in obesity, I don't see that data as a gating factor for user reimbursement of the drug. Maybe Mike can offer more details on that. Okay. Sure. Seamus, I mean, let me start with tirzepatide and sort of the comments that I made on the regulatory path. The FDA has clear guidance on what's required to get an indication for anti-obesity drug and those guidance documents form the basis of our previous discussions in alignment with the agency. Our base case based on those has been and really continues to be the submission will require the full package of Phase III data from this trial -- from this program. On the other hand, as I said, I think, we were impressed and delighted with the data that we got from SURMOUNT-1. It's a very large Phase III trial as you pointed out and there are a number of elements here that encouraged us to open the door for additional discussion with the FDA. You asked what is it specifically. Maybe I will highlight two or three things. First, the efficacy, as you pointed out, the more than 20% weight loss is really unprecedented level of weight loss in the field and I think that's exciting for patients and addressing a very significant unmet medical need. Second is the safety and tolerability data that we got. I think there is a pleasant surprise there if you look at how well tolerated this drug was, how few discontinuations we had, and as I pointed out, more discontinuations for treatment on placebo made more than on the active arms of the drug, just indicating that people tolerate this why I want to stay on the drug and appreciate the weight loss benefits they are getting. So the very good safety and tolerability profile that we are seeing, combined with the extraordinary efficacy profile, I think, is a major step in that argument. The last piece, of ,course is that we don't see this data in isolation. This builds on a very significant Type 2 diabetes program, which of course, involves many patients with Type 2 diabetes and obesity and demonstrated safety and efficacy in that setting as well. So we will see how that goes and I think to circle back to Chris' question, when do we learn more, as we have discussions with regulators. If we learn more and we see that there is an opportunity for expedited path here, we will be as forthcoming with investors as possible. Your second question here was around Alzheimer's and where we are thinking about our profile versus competitors and when those competitor readouts, what are we going to be looking at. I think we have a number of design elements in TRAILBLAZER 2 that we spoke about previously that we think could be very important, probably, starting with our use of biomarkers to select patients not just amyloid positivity, but also win doing in on patients with intermediate tau levels. So these aren't patients who have too much tau in the brain, because we think there beyond the point where anti-amyloid drugs will help them nor are they patients with no tau in the brain because we think those patients won't progress even on placebo, and therefore, won't get benefit from a drug. So we think selecting those patients will give us the opportunity to see better efficacy in a more homogenous background. Second, we think we have a drug that lowers amyloid faster and to a steeper degree and that should translate to improved benefits. And then third is some of the statistical differences in our analysis plan focusing on a composited measure ADRS, which we are excited about and things should be more highly powered to see a larger effect size. So all of those things combined lead us to a point where even if competitors trials are negative, and I think, there's a reasonable chance one or both could be, we won't be discouraged. What I expect to see though is when we look at the totality of data from competitor readouts prior to ours, we will see evidence that lowering amyloid in general is having a positive effect on solving cognition and function. Even if some trials on some endpoints at some time points hit or don't hit statistical significance, I think it's that totality data that will encourage us, and then as I said, our trial's designed to hit. So that's what we are hoping for and that's what we expect middle of next year. Yeah. Thanks for that question. I think you are right, in past studies of different medications for weight loss. There have been a lot of patients who didn't respond. That's not the case with tirzepatide. So we are really delighted that at the 10 milligram and 15 milligram dose, more than 96% of patients had at least 5% weight loss. So this drug is working to some extent in the vast majority of patients in this trial and nearly two-thirds of the patients at the highest dose are getting 20% weight loss, which is really a life-changing level. So I think you are right. Patients are -- have variable degrees of resistance to anti-obesity mechanisms. But I also think that this combination of GIP and GLP that we have in tirzepatide is such a powerful mechanism that it overcomes those resistant patients for the most part. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. So let me start with the Alzheimer's questions. I think we have been public about our stats plan. I think the focus on ADRS is well warranted by all of the data that we have collected by a pretty detailed statistical analysis, many of which have been published on past trials, which just show this is an outcome that performs better from a statistical perspective then things like CDR Sum of Boxes, while still capturing both function and cognition. So CDR is noisy and also appears unreliable. If you look across sister studies, for example, the two solanezumab studies or the two aducanumab studies, CDR Sum of Boxes can move in opposite directions in different studies whereas ADLs and ADAS-Cog, the two components of ADRS are much more reliable, move together show consistent effects. So that's where we are, I think it's an evolution of endpoints and we will do our best to justify that with regulators once we have our data. Why wouldn't we have CDR Sum of Boxes was the second part question. Well, of course, we do. It's -- will be a gated secondary for sure, and I think from our perspective, the worst case scenario is that we are held to achieving ADRS and CDR Sum of Boxes. That's okay. If that happens, I hope and expect that we will have a good chance to hit CDR Sum of Boxes. But, of course, we are going to put what we see is the least noisy, most reliable, most formative endpoint first in our statistical analysis, which is ADRS. With respect to IL-2, you are right. This was a pretty fast in and out in ulcerative colitis. We were pleased to enroll this Phase II study pretty quickly. We triggered interim analysis based on a certain number of patients with a certain amount of follow up and based on that analysis and pre-specified criteria, we do not see enough efficacy to proceed. So it fail that futility analysis. We dropped that indication, wind down that particular study in ulcerative colitis, but two other indications persist. All right. Steve, I think, you said, it's not a surprise. I think there are some things here that are quite a bit more positive than maybe most people would have expected. Certainly, the level of efficacy here that was achieved was I think higher than most expectations, as well as the tolerability. So the adverse events from nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, lower probably than what most people would have expected treatment discontinuations particularly lower. So I think on the whole, we have a data package that does exceed expectations. So it's really at the top end of the range of what we thought might be possible for a drug tirzepatide. So we are excited about that. Specifically, you are asking about regulatory interactions. We usually don't want to get into like back and forth on and things like that. But just to be clear, as I said before, our alignment with the FDA was around submitting when the full package is complete, and have not had discussions yet about what other options might exist in light of the state. Yeah. Thanks, Vamil. You are asking about our long-acting Amylin agonist here. We have been interested in biology of other incretins and incretin like pathways for many years, maybe a decade now or more. Amylin is one of those pathways. We have worked on dual Amylin calcitonin receptor agonist. This is a pure Amylin agonist. We are exploring these and other similar mechanisms as complements likely to tirzepatide. I don't expect any of these mechanisms to offer this kind of weight loss, 22.5% weight loss. But I think it may be for some patients who desire even additional weight loss that you could stack one of these mechanisms on top of tirzepatide. But clearly, we have raised the bar and we will look through our Phase I and Phase II portfolio now with even higher criteria for progressing. I think to a new weight loss mechanism now is going to have to be in the very high 20s I think to be an exciting advance beyond tirzepatide. Maybe adding something to tirzepatide could accomplish that and offer the majority of patient's efficacy similar even better to a bariatric surgery. That's the next frontier. Yeah. Mike, I -- we usually try not to disclose potential interims... ... to preserve the integrity of the study. So sometimes we build those options and sometimes, we are not. But I totally agree that this weight loss sort of at the high end of expectations, as I said earlier, it's just got to increase our confidence in HFpEF. And of course, as we dig deeper, we will look at a number of biomarkers in the study, which could further inform cardiovascular benefits. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks, Kerry. Just to clarify, we didn't announce plans for an early filing, we just said, we are moving to the next step and discussing options with regulators. You are right we do have a PR that we have repurchased. We are excited to have a portfolio with -- rich with opportunities, both new molecular entities, as well as the new indications such as the obesity indication. We will choose based on regulatory path that are available to us and unmet medical needs and competition, of course, what's the best opportunities that factor on. Yeah. Thanks. In this study, the tolerability of the 10 milligram and 15 milligram doses were pretty similar. So it's not surprising the treatment discontinuation rates could have been pretty similar. Of course, there is a little bit more efficacy on the 15 milligram dose, which is important driver to stay on therapy. So probably see the balance of tolerability and efficacy playing out a little bit better, perhaps, in the 15 milligram and the 10 milligram. But these are all pretty small rates of discontinuation, if you look at sort of mid single-digit rates of discontinuation for AEs. So that's really great. I think better than expected."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. 2022 is off to a strong start with, solid volume driven revenue growth led by our key products and the new tirzepatide obesity data we announced this morning. We are focused on driving adoption of our newer medicines, preparing for key product launches, delivering several global submissions for potential new medicines, all the while advancing our pipeline to power the next wave of growth. We are pleased with the progress we saw in the first quarter. Before I get to our results, I'd like to take a moment to address the tragic loss of life and the hardships we are seeing in Ukraine. Our Ukraine office is currently closed and operations are suspended. The safety of our employees and their families continues to be our top priority. We are working through logistical challenges in order to ensure supply of our medicines to those in need in Ukraine. Earlier this month, an initial shipment of medicines donated by Lilly including insulin arrived in Ukraine. Thanks to the tremendous efforts of our partners, project HOPE and Direct Relief. Few of our clinical trial participants are in Ukraine. So while we are doing everything we can to ensure continuity of their medical care, there is minimal impact to our global trials. With regard to Russia, we have suspended investments, our promotional activities and new clinical trials there. Our Russian operations are now only focused on ensuring people suffering from diseases like cancer and diabetes continue to get the Lilly medicines they need. Should we generate any profits from our sales in Russia, we will donate them to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief. Our revenue in Russia and Ukraine account for less than 1% of our total company sales in 2021. Moving to our results. You can see on slide four the progress we have made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue grew 15% or 17% on a constant currency basis and was driven by volume growth of 20%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta due to loss of exclusivity, revenue grew 10% for the quarter. This volume driven performance in Q1 is attributable to our key growth products, which grew 24% and now account for 61% of our core business. With long IP runways for many of these products and less than 10% of our 2022 revenue exposed to patent expiry in the next five years, along with the potential launch of five new medicines over the next 18 months, the durability of our growth outlook is quite strong. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 76.1% in Q1, an increase of approximately 70 basis points. Excluding revenue from COVID antibodies, gross margin was approximately 80% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4%, an increase of roughly 1,000 basis points, primarily driven by both higher gross margin and lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies. In our pipeline, we have several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including the U.S. and EU approval for Jardiance in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, as well as a recommendation from the Independent Data Monitoring Committee for an early start to the Phase III trial studying Jardiance for chronic kidney disease due to clear positive efficacy. The U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. The recent U.S. submission of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis and a positive Phase III topline readout for SURMOUNT-1, the first of four global studies to evaluate tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight. Dan will talk in more detail later, but we are very excited with the results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-1 topline readout. We believe there is significant potential for tirzepatide to build off the impressive results we saw from our clinical program in Type 2 diabetes and help people with obesity, a disease impacting over 110 million people in United States and approximately 650 million people worldwide. Obesity is a chronic and progressive disease that causes over 2.8 million deaths globally each year. The economic impact associated with obesity is more than $1 trillion in the U.S. alone. We believe addressing obesity could make a difference in millions of people's lives, have a significant impact on public health and reduce healthcare costs. We are hopeful that we are entering a new era of obesity care, where people have medicines that can help treat their obesity and this is our first proof point on that journey. We continue to rapidly advance nucleic acid innovation at Lilly, building on our growing portfolio with the launch of the Lilly Institute for Genetic Medicines, a $700 million facility in Boston. We will develop novel RNA and DNA-based medicines, as well as push the boundaries of delivery technology to unlock difficult to treat targets in key strategic areas for us like neurodegeneration, diabetes and obesity. Finally, we distributed nearly $900 million in dividends in the quarter and completed $1.5 billion in share repurchases. On slide five and six, you will see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and COVID-19 antibody updates we are discussing today. Now, I will turn the call over to Anat to review the Q1 results. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress we have made this year. We delivered solid sales growth, driven largely by volume from our key growth products, which represent 61% of our core business. We continue to see opportunity for meaningful operating margin expansion over time, excluding the impact of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. We made significant progress developing new medicines with exciting advances, including for Jardiance and HFpEF, the EUA Authorization for bebtelovimab, the submission of mirikizumab and ulcerative colitis, as well as positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in obesity and Jardiance in chronic kidney disease. Finally, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We are committed to invest for the long term to advance promising R&D opportunities and support launches to bring groundbreaking therapies to patients diagnosed with some of the most challenging diseases facing human kind, like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer, cancer and autoimmune disorders. With the progress we have seen to-date, we remain extremely confident in our long-term growth prospects. Now, I will turn the call over to Kevin to moderate our Q&A session. Go ahead. Okay. Great. Well, thanks for joining today's earnings and tirzepatide call, I guess, and your interest, of course, in the company. It is an exciting moment for all of us. 2022 started in a similar fashion to how we ended 2021, with strong momentum across the business. We remain focused on executing our innovation based strategy, which of course, is to bring new medicines to patients and create value for all our stakeholders. With strong commercial execution complemented by a pipeline of industry-leading opportunities, we believe Lilly continues to be a compelling investment. So thanks for dialing in today and please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on the call and have a great day. Thanks."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Before I review the financial results for Q1, it is important to note that beginning this quarter, following directions from the SEC, presentation of non-GAAP measures will not include upfront charges and development milestones related to acquired in-process R&D and development. While this has no bearing on how we conduct our business, it will have an impact on how we represent -- how we present our non-GAAP measures. This change in presentation of financial results will have the effect of pulling into non-GAAP measures, certain charges that were previously reported owning our GAAP financial results. We expect this change will increase non-GAAP operating expenses and decrease non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share. To help with year-on-year comparison of our non-GAAP measures, you can find a revised workbook in our Investor website, reflecting the updated presentation of our 2020 and 2021 results. Slide seven summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2022. I will focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue grew 15%, excluding COVID -- excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue increased 10%, highlighting solid momentum for our core business. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 70 basis points to 76.1% in Q1 2022. The increase in gross margin percent was primarily driven by the unfavorable effects of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold in Q1 2021, partially offset by increased sales of COVID antibodies, which have lower gross margin profile than the rest of our portfolio and to a lesser extent, lower realized prices. Increase in manufacturing costs and logistics due to inflation had a modest impact on gross margin in Q1. Total operating expenses decreased 6% this quarter, which as a reminder, is now inclusive of acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased 1%, while R&D expenses decreased 4%, driven by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of $166 million or $0.15 of EPS, primarily related to purchase of the Priority Review Voucher. In Q1 2021, acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges were $312 million or $0.27 of EPS. Operating income increased 66% in Q1, driven by higher revenue, primarily due to higher sales of COVID antibodies, lower R&D expenses for COVID antibodies, and to a lesser extent, lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 33.4% for the quarter and reflects the benefit from COVID-19 antibodies revenue, as well as the negative impact of approximately 210 basis points attributed to acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. Other income and expense was income of approximately $38 million this quarter, compared with income of $35 million in Q1 2021. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 10.3%, an increase of 140 basis points compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit this quarter, partially offset by decreased tax expenses related to the implementation of the provision in the 2017 Tax Act required to capitalize research and development expenses. As the bottomline, we delivered strong earnings per share growth of 63% in Q1, inclusive of approximately 1500 basis points related to lower acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges. On slide eight, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue grew 31% and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in the U.S. This growth was driven by volume, led by Trulicity, Verzenio, Jardiance, Olumiant, and Taltz. We experienced a net price decline of 1% for the quarter and continue to expect a mid single-digit price decline in the U.S. for the full year. As a reminder, a single competitor to Alimta launch in the U.S. in February and we expect broad generic entry in may result in a significant erosion of U.S. Alimta revenue. Moving to Europe, revenue in Q1 declined 13% in constant currency and when excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Alimta, revenue grew 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Trulicity, Taltz, Jardiance, Verzenio and Olumiant. We expect continued growth in Europe excluding Alimta. For Japan, Q1 revenue decreased 21% in constant currency, as our business there continues to be negatively affected by significant declines in off-patent products, primarily Cymbalta and Alimta. Key growth products now represent 65% of total revenue in Japan and we expect to return to growth in Japan beginning in 2023. In China, revenue grew 10% in constant currency. The NRDL access has driven significant volume growth for newer products like Tyvyt, Trulicity, Verzenio and Taltz, and has been partially offset by related price decreases. We expect this improved access to continue to drive future volume growth, more than offsetting the price decline. The recent COVID-19 outbreak in China and the subsequent protective measures that are currently being put in place to control the spread of the virus highlight the potential for commercial impact in China in the near-term, particularly for infused products, like Tyvyt. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 29% in constant currency this quarter, driven primarily by $95 million in revenue from the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia, as well as by increased sales of key growth products. We continue to expect a mid single-digit net price decline in 2022 for the U.S., Europe and Japan, with the worldwide net price decline in the high single-digit driven by the expanded NRDL access for our products in China. As shown on slide nine, our key growth products continue to drive robust worldwide volume growth. These products drove nearly 15% points of volume growth this quarter and continue to bolster overall performance and outlook. Slide 10 further highlights the contributions of our key growth products. This quarter these brands generated $3.9 billion in revenue and made up 61% of our core business revenue, growing 24%. We are pleased with the continued market growth of both the GLP-1 and SGLT2 classes where Trulicity and Jardiance are market leaders, as well as with the strong Taltz prescription growth. We are also encouraged by the significant uptake of Verzenio in Q1, driven by the approval and launch of the adjuvant indication, which has led to an inflection in both new and total prescriptions. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2022, we invested $2.4 billion to drive our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased 1.5 billion in stock. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, as we continue to fund our key market product and expect the new launches, invest in our pipeline, pursue opportunities for external innovation to augment our future growth prospects and return excess capital to shareholders. Slide 12 is the updated 2022 financial guidance. As I previously noted, our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures will now include IPR&D and development milestone charges. For guidance, we will include charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of the earnings release and will not include any impact from potential or pending business development. We are providing information that should make this change as easy as possible to understand, as well as incorporate into modeling. As always, please let us know if there's anything else we can do to be of assistance as you navigate through this transition. I do want to reiterate that margin expansion continues to be priority for our team. Consistent with prior communication, excluding IPR&D development milestone charges, we expect to drive further non-GAAP operating margin expansion over time. Getting into the numbers underline our updated guidance, there is several items of benefits first quarter results, which are not expected to recur. These include approximately $1.45 billion of COVID antibody sales, U.S. Alimta revenue of approximately $250 million that will be impacted by multi-source generic entrants in Q2 and beyond, a favorable effective tax rate and a one-time benefit related to the resolution of cefaclor patent litigation in Canada. I would also remind you that as we look ahead to the second quarter, the Q2 2021 revenue benefited from the sale of Cialis rights in China, which will provide roughly 2.5 percentage points of headwind to our topline growth in Q2. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the guidance range by $1 billion to now be in the range of $28.8 billion to $29.3 billion, reflecting the additional revenue for bebtelovimab sales in Q1. While project an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate, we are expecting to offset it with stronger core business performance. We anticipate that any additional revenue from sales of COVID-19 antibodies to be limited begin in Q2 2022, while the U.S. Government has an option to purchase additional 500,000 doses of bebtelovimab no later than July 31st of this year, it is uncertain whether this option will be exercised, and therefore, it is not included in our guidance. Moving down the income statement, GAAP gross margin percent is now expected to be approximately 76%, while non-GAAP margin, gross margin is now expected to be approximately 78%. The majority of this 200 basis point reduction is due to the impact of Q1 bebtelovimab sales, which have lower gross margin and to a lesser extent an increase of approximately $100 million in logistics and manufacturing costs due to inflation. The range for R&D expenses has been increased by $100 million to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, driven by investment in our late-stage pipeline, primarily Alzheimer's clinical development and investment to advance to diagnostics ecosystem. Our guidance includes acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges of approximately $521 million, reflecting Q1 charges of $166 million, with the remainder primarily related to a charge associated with the buyout of future obligations that were contingent upon development, regulatory and commercial success of our Meudon selective PI3K inhibitor. This guidance does not include any impact from potential or pending business development transaction. GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 200 basis points to approximately 28% and 30%, respectively, primarily due to the negative impact associated with the acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges to date. Given the accounting change for acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, in the inherent variability associated with such charges, our non-GAAP operating margin figure will not measure efficiency in the same way it has done historically. However, you contract our operating margin in the way you deem appropriate, knowing that we aim to expand operating margin over time, excluding acquired IPR&D and develop in milestone charges. Our Q1 2022 tax rate and EPS include a favorable impact from the provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires capitalization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Our financial guidance for the full year is unchanged and assumed that this provision will be deferred or repealed over Congress, effective for 2022. If this provision is not deferred or repealed effective this year then we would expect the reported and non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11%. It is notable that while this provision favorably impacts certain tax items, which decreased our effective tax rate, we expect it will increase our 2022 cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.5 billion. Based on these changes, we have lowered our reported EPS guidance by $0.70 to now be in the range of $7.3 per share to $7.45 per share and lower our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.50 to $8.30. That $0.35 reduction are non-core -- in our non-GAAP EPS range includes the 55% decrease due to the year-to-date acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges, partially offset by improved business performance of $0.20 attributable to the net benefit of Q1 bebtelovimab sales and increased investments in R&D. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. So for the dynamics in Q1, we typically see dynamic associated with inventory build at the end of each calendar year in December and then following by inventory burn typically in the first quarter of each year. We saw the same dynamic here this year. We saw an impact on Trulicity and a number of other products, which you may be seeing in as you are looking at the year-on-year comparison. The other element, if you are looking at Taltz from a year-on-year perspective, we did see in Q1 in comparison to Q1 of 2021 reduction in script size. As you recall, last year we had -- we started our contract with ESI and the loading dose with associate with multiple devices that each patient started on. So this quarter we are just seeing a reduction associated with that year-on-year comparison. Kerry, so on the IPR&D charges, while we are now building them into our non-GAAP actuals and we will provide information not just on the quarterly results, but anything, any business development transactions that have been signed between the end of the quarter in our earnings call. But you -- if you look even at our numbers from last year, these numbers are highly variable and highly unpredictable. So you can move from 40 million in one quarter to 400 million in another quarter or even zero. And when we issue guidance, it is practically impossible for us to provide any detailed view on what those charges will be, not knowing what business development transaction we will be signing. So what we will do is, as we have those, we will provide that information to the investment community every quarter. Typically if it's associated with the large business development transaction there will be a press release associated with it within the quarter. So you will be able to see and track that. But providing it as part of guidance is challenging, practically impossible actually to predict these."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question on donanemab. So, as Dan mentioned, our priority will be to advocate for reconsideration with the TB-2 Phase III data. So we do remain confident in donanemab and believe that TB-2 and our overall TRAILBLAZER program have extensive data and so as we review the requirements in the NCD, we believe our data should be sufficient to meet the high level of evidence criteria set forth by CMS if TB-2 as positive. Obviously, we will need to review this data with CMS and gain their agreement. So we will do that very quickly. Our intention is as soon as we have that data to request reconsideration for national coverage and we believe that having two positive pivotal trials should meet that high level of evidence. As far as CMS, we have engaged with them throughout the process and so we will continue to do so moving forward. And there's a number of statements in the NCD that we will see clarity on to gain additional clarity as we move forward. But, yes, we do believe that we should meet that high level of evidence, but pending those discussions with CMS."

            "name": "Mike Mason",
            "content": "All right. Louise, thanks for the compliment upfront. We appreciate that. I think the market opportunity is, kind of remains what we thought before, we see it as a sizable opportunity and when we look at the just the massive numbers of people who live with obesity over 100 million people in the U.S., 650 million people globally contributes a burden of over $1 trillion globally. We do think it's a huge opportunity. It should be perceived as a -- and treated as a chronic illness. It not only has health implications. But if you live with obesity, it's a very visible disease unlike others that really brings with it some unfortunate stigma into society that really hurts individuals both physically and emotionally. And so there is a need to treat this disease. The market is not going to develop overnight. We have to increase awareness that this is a chronic disease that needs to be treated. We do need to establish and grow the access for it. So we are looking long-term to this. I think it's important for us to be able to build the foundation, build the knowledge that this is a chronic disease, get that appreciated by healthcare professionals and payers and then grow the market. So we are going to look long-term. We are investing obviously not only in tirzepatide but early -- many early assets, because we do think this is a need in the marketplace that we need to focus on, and obviously, we are quite delighted by SURMOUNT-1, not only the high dose. I mean, obviously, when we saw the 52 pounds of weight loss at the high dose on average, we were wowed by that, but I am also as excited about the 16% weight loss at the 5 milligram, because everyone -- we look at the averages, but there is no averages out there. Every individual is different and we need to have a medication that at different doses offer different weight loss and so I am very pleased about the dose profile and the weight loss profile across all the doses. As Dan said, we have originally on the -- on your filing question, we have aligned with the FDA on four trials for the SURMOUNT-1, 2, 3 and 4 program. But given the huge market need and given this data, we do think it warrants a discussion with the FDA about whether we can find a path to accelerate it to the marketplace to meet this need. The SURMOUNT-1 data is great. We also have over 4,000 patients in the SURPASS-5 Global Restoration studies that provides a lot of good information on the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in the diabetes population to go along with SURMOUNT-1. So we look forward to that conversation. I think when we -- when you look at, I think your last question was, are we more excited about diabetes and obesity. I think we are equally excited about both of them. Obviously, we will focus our attention on diabetes first, still a huge massive unmet need. We have unfortunately only half of people who live with Type 2 diabetes in good control. So we will focus on that and then we will focus long term on obesity as I have said earlier. So thanks for the question. Thanks for the compliments. Appreciate it. Okay. Thanks for the question. I will answer your second question first on kind of our commercial positioning. Obviously, for competitive reasons, we will keep that to ourselves at this time, know that we will focus on maximizing the opportunity long-term in diabetes and obesity and we will make the right moves whether that's one or two brands. We will have dialogs with the FDA on the one versus two brands and it's too early to talk about that at this point. With regards to the AdCom, we don't anticipate an AdCom for tirzepatide. Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. Thanks and thanks for the compliments on the data. Yeah. The -- I wouldn't look backwardly at the fact that with that obesity agents up to this point really haven't been able to secure good access, at the weight loss levels that you were seeing 5%, 6%, 7% weight loss. No one was able to produce or no one has produced health outcome benefits at that level of weight loss. So it makes sense for payers not opening access for those probably more cosmetic than true health benefits. But if you are looking at a product like tirzepatide that can deliver up to 22.5% weight loss, we do believe and there's good data out there to suggest that's going to really improve and lead to the good health outcomes. We have to produce that over time and we will do that. But I don't think that will limit us from gaining access in the meantime. I think when you look at novel access [inaudible] under at 20 million, 25 million, people who live with obesity in the U.S. having access. So I think we can continue to build on that. I think there was a real big win for obesity access recently with the Federal Health employees gaining access for obesity agents. So I think that's a important trend. Also understand that we are -- we have -- we are dedicated to produce a series of trials that we hope will demonstrate and we expect to demonstrate good outcomes with tirzepatide for sleep apnea, HFpEF, as well as our outcome study that will include cardiovascular. Now those are indications right now that do have access. So both Part D you take sleep apnea, for example, that has good coverage in both commercial and Part D. So we do expect that we show good outcomes there that for those people who have obesity and sleep apnea that we should be able to gain access for it. So we think we do believe that access will start off and where it is today and grow it over time. But we are committed long-term to build access and help people who live with obesity for the duration. Okay. I think that may have been more than two, but I will go through these pretty quickly. So, first of all, weight loss plateauing. I think we have to leave some of the data for our medical meetings coming up. So I will reserve that for that. We do believe that this is a chronic illness that requires a chronic treatment. So we do believe people will need to stay on the drug long-term in order to get the benefit. And then pre-diabetes, I look at that as an important population that tirzepatide could provide health outcomes for, so probably more about showing data where our segment could benefit from it versus having a labeled indication for it. And then -- okay. Go ahead. Yeah. As I said earlier, I do think it's going to be one that you are not going to probably spur now the gate on that. You will have a sizable segment but one that will grow over time. We will provide supportive care bridging programs, as you say at launch to make sure and support people so they can have a good experience and see the benefit to the weight loss. But we do think it's something that this is one that I would look at the obesity market, one that will establish, it will be decent size, but it will grow for the next decade or two. Yeah. Thanks for the questions. A very good question. The -- when you look at diabetes versus obesity, it's hard to compare, I think, to suggest that because the nature of the diseases that you will have like similar discontinuation rates or our length of therapy. When you look at when someone starts Trulicity in Type 2 diabetes, they only have a fraction of the beta cell health of someone who is normal before the onset and the run-up of pre-diabetes and diabetes has lowered the functioning of the beta cell and so what you have in diabetes is that beta cell health continues to decline and then at some point, you may have to go on insulin. We don't believe that it will have that same dynamic and obesity that the effect of weight loss with someone who lives with obesity is not going to have that same effect of kind of wearing off with the beta cell health that you see for Trulicity and our GLPs in diabetes. So we do believe that the weight loss will be more durable and that patients will be well motivated to stay on therapy. That said, it will be an area of focus for us to make sure that we learn why people stop taking obesity agents and we will do whatever we can to support patients during the entire length of therapy. Yeah. I mean, good question. I mean I think the strength of the SURMOUNT-1 data makes us confidence in the entire tirzepatide Phase III program for all indications and so, obviously, our hypothesis, one of the hypothesis was weight loss would help individuals with HFpEF, and obviously SURMOUNT-1 supported that. So we are confident in our HFpEF program for tirzepatide. I don't believe we have, and maybe Dan can lead into that question, off the top of my head, but I do believe we have any interim readouts on our heart failure study. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our focus is going to be growing the class, as well as growing our share of market in the class. We will try to maximize the opportunity for our entire incretin portfolio. I mean what's most important is not necessarily switches for molecules, existing products, but more the new patients that are coming on into the incretin class and winning those new patients. And so, I think over time, we will get a mix between new patient starts and switches from other GLPs. But I think primarily, our focus is going to be on really driving tirzepatide wins of new patients coming into the class and so that will be our approach going forward. Yeah. Good question. We touched on this a little bit early, but I think, the -- we expect the Step CV study to be successful given the expected weight loss and what he has expressed. We think that will be important to continue to grow the class and for some payers winning access on it. So we hope that the Step program is successful, we expect it will be, and obviously, we have a very comprehensive Phase III program to demonstrate outcomes for obesity, we also are confident in. Yeah. Good questions. And when we are having discussions with payers, they do -- they are excited about the obesity class, if we can demonstrate outcomes. And if they have a patient who has seen benefits from an anti-obesity medication, they actually want to work with us to make sure that those individual stay on therapy in order to get and maintain the weight loss they have seen and so I think there will be opportunities for us to partner with payers to ensure that we can maintain individuals on chronic medications. I think our expectation is that people do need to stay on tirzepatide long term in order to get the -- and maintain the weight benefits and we will be working with payers to make sure that we can maintain that weight loss, so people can get the outcomes that they need. Second question-- remind me, Kevin, what the second question was? Yeah. I mean, I think, that we are going to talk about and in today's discussion obviously we will internalize this data. We will -- this is, as we said earlier, this is an important therapeutic area for us, massive unmet needs and one that we are looking to play the long-term game on. So when you put those together, we obviously are, we will be very thoughtful and aggressive and if we do feel that there is additional need for trials on tirzepatide that can provide insights to payers and healthcare professionals, we will do those trials. Thanks for the questions."

            "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question about SERDs. Our view of our program in the landscape hasn't really changed all that much in light of the recent announcements. Obviously, as it relates to the two most recent trial readouts, we have yet to see the actual data, though at least in one case there were some directional clues given by company management. I think largely speaking we saw those studies as sort of underpowered Phase II trials, and I think in many cases, what we are hearing qualitatively from those companies suggests exactly that. In other words, trends in the right direction but underpowered studies. Our initial second lines randomized trial that we are recruiting right now is a fully powered Phase III study. So if anything, we are actually more confident in that study winning than we were previously. But that's not really the -- that may be the first path to market for the agent and impactful for those patients In the late-line setting, but that's not really the ultimate I think most impactful place for the medicine, which is really in the adjuvant setting and we are working on the trial design there that we will talk more about later this year."

And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Diabetes and obesity and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: All right, thanks, Joe. 2023 was a year of advancement across our company. We grew our top-line. We progressed our pipeline. It advanced our external innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We continue to invest in quality, the reliability and the resilience of our company's manufacturing infrastructure, and most importantly, delivered new life-saving and life-changing medicines to more patients. In 2023, revenue grew 20% for the full year and 28% for the most recent quarter, as our newly launched portfolio continued to gain momentum. This past year, we announced positive Phase IIIs for Donanemab, Tirzepatide, Mirikizumab And Pertibrutinib. We also announced a positive Phase II result for Orforglipron as well as Retatrutide and moved these two important molecules into Phase III. In terms of external innovation, in 2023, we continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. These transactions included the acquisition of DICE Therapeutics, POINT Biopharma, Versanis Bio, Emergence Therapeutics, Mablink Biosciences, Immunotrac as well as Sigilon Therapeutics. We have several significant investments in manufacturing, including plans to expand capacity at the company's Research Triangle Park facility and the two manufacturing sites within the LEAP Innovation Park in Boone County, Indiana. Most recently, we announced plans to construct a new high-tech manufacturing site in Germany. This facility will further expand the company's global injectable product and device manufacturing network, including for our diabetes and obesity portfolio. Most importantly, this past year, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2023, we received regulatory approvals for Zepbound, Jaypirca, Omvoh, in the U.S. -- in the EU rather, and an expanded label for Verzenio and two new indications for Jardiance. This progress will serve as a foundation to drive top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion over time. As you can see on Slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 28% with our new products growing by over $2 billion. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones in addition to the Zepbound and Jaypirca CLL approvals, today, we announced top line results for the Tirzepatide Phase II SYNERGY-NASH trial as well as the Verzenio Phase III CYCLONE two trial. Dan will talk more about this update -- in his update. In terms of business development, in Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Mablink Bioscience and POINT Biopharma, the latter of which expands our capacity and capability into Radioligand therapies. Lastly, we announced a 15% dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and distributed over $1 billion in dividends in the fourth quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, and other updates. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our performance was highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, driven by our new products and growth products. Q4 revenue increased 28% compared to Q4 2022. Excluding divestiture, this represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance and the recent launch of Zepbound. For the full year, revenue increased 20% driven by robust volume growth of 16%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 82.3%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with launches of new products and additional indications as well as higher incentive compensation costs. R&D expenses increased 28%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as higher incentive compensation costs. In Q4, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $623 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.62. In Q4 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $240 million or $0.23 negative impact to EPS. Operating income increased 29% in Q4, driven by higher revenue from new launches, partially offset by operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 28% for the quarter and included a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 7.3% in Q4 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2022 and the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.49 in Q4, a 19% increase compared to Q4 2022, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.62 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.23 in Q4 2022. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 39% in Q4, driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Zepbound. Net price in the U.S. increased 27% for the quarter, driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamic as well as the onetime favorable change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. Europe continued its trend of strong growth in Q4. Excluding $65 million in revenue associated with milestones received for the EU approval and launch of Revenue was up 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. For Japan, we are pleased to see robust growth in Q4 as revenue increased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio and Mounjaro. Moving to China, Q4 revenue increased 7% in constant currency with volume growth of 10% partially offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Pivot. We are pleased to see China return to growth in 2023. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 10% in constant currency. However, when you exclude the impact of the Q4 2022 sales of rights for Alimta Korea and Taiwan, sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and growth product categories combined contributed approximately 15 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 42% in Q4 driven by robust demand growth and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The continued positive momentum is driven by early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 30% for the quarter. In the U.S., Jardiance revenue increased 29%, driven by increased demand. In Q4, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 14%. U.S. revenue decreased 18% driven by lower volume and lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays for filling orders of Trulicity. Starting in early December and going through January, all dose strengths of Trulicity were indicated as having limited availability on the FDA drug shortage site. We expect to experience intermittent delays orders of certain doses in the coming months. In international markets, Trulicity volume continued to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to Slide 11, Mounjaro continued its robust growth as more Type 2 diabetes patients benefited from the medicine. Q4 revenue grew to over $2.2 billion globally, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2023. In the U.S., Mounjaro revenue of $2.1 billion in Q4, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2023, benefited from a onetime change in SMS for rebates and discounts. Adjusted for this onetime change, sequential net sales in the U.S. would have grown approximately 30% in Q4. Since our last call, we further expanded patient access to Mounjaro. As of February 1, access for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. was 90% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 92% access for commercial patients. This expanded access puts Mounjaro near parity with established injectable Incretins and gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay part program expired on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. Compared to Q4 2022, the Mounjaro net price in Q4 2023 benefited from this change to the co-pay part program in the U.S. Recall that after a change to the noncovered co-pay program in late 2022, patients already started on the $25 co-pay card could remain in the program until June 30. Today, commercially insured patients without coverage utilize the current noncovered co-pay program and pay roughly half the list price for Mounjaro prescription. Turning to Slide 12. In November, we received FDA approval for Zepbound for adults with obesity or those who are overweight and have weight-related comorbidities. We then announced on December five that Zepbound available at U.S. pharmacies, and we started building commercial formulary access before the end of the year. We are pleased with the early access of approximately one-third of commercial lives covered as of February 1. Access in this market will be more gradual as individual employers need to opt in to coverage after the typical formulary contracting takes place. We are focused on building formulary access and employer opt-ins, but we expect that it will take some time before we reach broad open access in this market. Meanwhile, the commercial savings for our program is available at U.S. pharmacies for those who do not yet have coverage. In Medicare Part D, weight loss drugs are still prohibited from reimbursement. In Q4, we recognized $176 million in sales for Zepbound with approximately 3/4 of that coming from initial channel stocking. The initial prescription trends we have seen are encouraging. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. Looking forward to 2024 and beyond, we have confidence in our existing commercial portfolio, bolstered by the recent launches of Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Zepbound and the potential launches of the Donanemab and Lebrikizumab, all of which we expect to serve as drivers for contained growth through the balance of the decade. On Slide 14, you'll see a summary of our outlook; outline our capital deployment decisions in relation to achievement of our strategic deliverables. We will invest in our current portfolio and in the future innovation through R&D, business development and a comprehensive manufacturing expansion agenda designed to drive revenue growth and speed life-changing medicines to patients. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend increases in line with earnings growth over time and share repurchases with excess capital. Moving to Slide 15, we highlight some of the dynamics that may impact our 2024 financial results. We expect continued robust revenue growth with revenue from our core business which excludes revenue from divestiture growing nearly 30% at the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by positive momentum to simply launch products. In Incretins, anticipated growth will be led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. In 2023, we made tremendous strides in expanding access from Mounjaro, and we entered 2024 with 90% of commercial and Part D lives covered. Zepbound coverage is off to a good start in its early December launch, and we expect both Tirzepatide to contribute substantially to Lilly's revenue growth in 2024. While we expect Mounjaro and Zepbound to be drivers of revenue growth, this will be partially offset by an expected continuation of the softer Trulicity sales trends that we saw in the second half of 2023. Recent revenue declines for Trulicity in the U.S. has been driven by supply tightness. Volume has also been impacted by our actions outside the U.S. As for supply outlook for Emberton, our manufacturer organization continues to execute well on the most ambitious expansion agenda in our company's long history. Given strong demand and time required to bring capacity fully online, we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2024. In late 2022, we showed our expectation that by year-end 2023, our capacity for Incretin auto-injector pens would double. This goal was achieved through significant efforts from our manufacturing colleagues and partners around the globe. In 2024, our capacity execution efforts will continue with equal urgency and will be accomplished not just through increased auto-injector capacity but also through alternative presentation like our multi-use Quick Pen, which received regulatory approval in the U.K. in late January. We expect our manufacturing site in Concord, North Carolina, will initiate production as early as the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025. And we are pursuing a host of the projects, internal and external, large and small, to further expand capacity. Now I'll provide a bit more context on the timing and pace of our Incretin supply plans in 2024. While we're continuing to expand supply every quarter, we expect the most significant production increases to come in the second half of the year. We expect our production of sellable doses in the second half of 2024 will be at least one and a half times the production in the second half of 2023. Note that while last year, our commentary focused on capacity of auto-injectors devices compared to 2022, we're now referring sellable doses produced, which is more relevant to patients and investors. Beyond Incretin, we look forward to progressing our launch project for two other medicine approved and launched in 2023, Jaypirca and Omvoh. Jaypirca was initially approved by the FDA in January 2023 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma under the accelerated approval program, received FDA approval also on the Accelerated Approval Program in December 2023 for adult patients with CLL or SLL that have received at least two prior lines of therapy. We look forward to the ongoing opportunity to help patients with this medicine as our best Phase III program continues. Omvoh was approved in October 2023 in the U.S. and earlier that year in Japan, Europe and other markets and represents a compelling new options for patients struggling with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And in 2024, we look forward to potential U.S. launches of two more medicines, Donanemab and Lebrikizumab. We continue to expect FDA regulatory actions on Donanemab in Q4 2024 and remain confident in the substantial potential for Donanemab to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease. With the current state of diagnostic and treatment readiness, initial uptake will be somewhat limited, and we expect Donanemab to contribute only modestly to growth in 2024 once approved. Lebrikizumab, which last year was approved and launched in Europe under the brand name by our partner, received regulatory approval in Japan in January. As for the U.S., we look forward to the potential proof of Lebrikizumab by the end of the year. We believe the efficacy, safety and dosing of Lebrikizumab can make it a compelling option for patients and prescribers in a large and growing market for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Given the expected timing of FDA regulatory action, we expect Lebrikizumab to contribute only modestly to revenue growth in 2024. Beyond our recently launched portfolio of medicine, we expect continued growth from Verzenio driven by the early breast cancer indication where the magnitude and maturity of our clinical data reinforces it as a standard of care treatment in node-positive high-risk early breast cancer. Jardiance has been another outstanding contributor to growth, and we expect revenue growth to continue in 2024 though at a slower price as strong growth may be dampened by pricing dynamics in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we expect an acceleration of growth in every major geography led not only by the anticipated launches of Tirzepatide but also continued strong growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. Lastly, we seek to create long-term value beyond this decade. We will continue to invest across our value chain, in our recent and upcoming potential launches, in our pipeline, and in our manufacturing footprint. Slide 16 summarizes our initial 2024 financial guidance. Starting at the top line, revenue is expected to be between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion. Using the midpoint of the 2024 range, this represents roughly 20% growth or 29% growth for our core business, which excludes the impact of divestitures that took place in 2023. In terms of phasing of our revenue growth throughout 2024, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, consistent with the increased availability of Incretin doses. In terms of pricing for our core business, which excludes divestitures, we expect a high single-digit percent price decline in 2024. The lingering base period impact of the Mounjaro non-covered co-pay card dynamics will dampen these price declines in the first half of 2024, with more significant price declines expected in the second half of the year. During this year, we are taking a streamlined approach to our guidance line items related to expenses. Rather than provide three separate guidance line items for gross margin, research and development costs and marketing and sale and administrative costs, we are presenting a single new ratio representing our margin after planned costs, calculated by subtracting R&D costs and marketing and administrative costs from gross margin and dividing that figure by revenue. We express this ratio as a percentage, and for 2024, we expect it to be in the range of 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis. While we are not providing a specific guidance number for gross margin as a percent of sales, our expectations remain consistent, but we will maintain gross margin of approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis as productivity gains and volumes are offset by pricing pressures and the cost of new manufacturing facilities. As for our expense growth across key categories, we expect marketing and administrative expenses to again grow in 2024 though at a slower pace than revenues, with growth driven by marketing investments in our recently launched and upcoming launch products. We also expect R&D expenses in 2024 to increase, driven by growing investments across all phases of our pipeline as we invest for the future, with the majority of dollar growth driven by ongoing and new late-phase opportunities. We expect R&D expense to increase at a higher rate than marketing, sell and administrative expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million of expense, primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to taxes; we expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Note that this rate does not assume or repeal of the provision of the 2017 Tax Act, requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Should such a change take effect, our effective tax rate for 2024 would be moderately higher. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.70 on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior practice, we are not including any potential or pending acquired IPR&D and even milestone charges in our 2024 guidance, and we will provide updates each quarter from the impact of IPR&D on earnings per share as acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges are incurred. For guidance modelling purposes, we're currently estimating diluted weighted average share outstanding for 2024 to be approximately 903 million. We entered 2024 with strong momentum and a remarkable opportunity to help millions more patients with our medicines. For our investors, 2024 should be another exciting year, driven by expected revenue growth in our core business, near an approaching 30% and continued investments to drive future growth. Our outlook for top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion remains on track. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our continued progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. I'll start with our progress against diabetes, obesity and complications thereof. Today, we announced positive results from SYNERGY-NASH. The Phase II study of Tirzepatide in adults with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis, also known as MASH. As shown on Slide 17, the study met its primary endpoint with up to 74% of participants achieving an absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks compared to less than 13% of participants reaching this endpoint on placebo. We are equally encouraged by results seen in the secondary endpoint, evaluating improvement in fibrosis. While the study was not designed to be statistically powered to evaluate improvement in fibrosis, the study results showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect across all doses on the proportion of participants achieving a decrease of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of MASH to placebo. The adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials studying Tirzepatide in people living with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes. The full SYNERGY-NASH results will be presented at a medical congress later this year. As you know, late last year, we received FDA approval on Zepbound, which marks Lilly's first approved treatment for obesity. This is a landmark occasion for patients and for the field as Zepbound is the first and only approved treatment activating two Incretin hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1 to tackle on the underlying cause of excess weight. Also, in early-stage development, we have now advanced our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist for the treatment of diabetes into Phase I and our long-acting Atrial natriuretic peptide for treatment of heart failure into Phase I. We've advanced mastatide into Phase II for obesity as we've begun to dose patients in that study. We are pleased that early this year, our partner, Innovent, reported positive results in the Phase III GORE-I study of mastetide in Chinese adults with obesity. In helps the development and commercialization rights for in China and Lilly retains the rights to the rest of the world. Moving to oncology. Today, we shared that in the Phase III CYCLONE two trial, Verzenio added to abiraterone did not meet the primary endpoint of improved radiographic progression-free survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the study, we employ an adaptive Phase II/III design. And while the Phase II stage met the prespecified threshold for the independent data monitoring committee to recommend initiation of Phase III, the signal was not confirmed in the Phase III portion in a larger sample size. The overall safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the known profiles of the medicines. We anticipate sharing full results from the CYCLONE two study at a future medical meeting. Since our last earnings call, Jaypirca received approval under the FDA's Accelerated Approval program for the treatment of divergence with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL2 inhibitor. We also reported that the Phase III confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval, known as BRUIN CLL 321 met its primary endpoint, and we plan to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. With the CLL and SLL approvals, Jaypirca is now the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent BTK inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL and SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. This was the second approval for Jaypirca in 2023 with the first in patients with MCL. We believe these two indications only represent the beginning of the eventual impact Jaypirca can have for patients, and we look forward to seeing the data from the rest of the Phase III program across CLL, SLL and MCI. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, which begins Lilly's entry into radioligand therapy, a promising technology with potential to deliver meaningful advances against a range of cancers. We welcome our new Point colleagues to Lilly, and we look forward to building on their work to grow this capability at Lilly. 2024 is also poised to be a particularly productive year for new clinical starts in oncology, as we begin to see the results of the new oncology R&D strategy that we implemented about four years ago after the Loxo acquisition. Through a combination of internal discovery efforts and business development, we expect to put at least five new molecules into the clinic this year, a wild-type of selective KRASG12D inhibitor, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, two antibody-drug conjugates with two biasomere's payloads, one against Nectin-4 and one against folate receptor alpha and an actinium PSMA radioligand therapy. I'll speak in a moment about our clinical KRASG12C program, but you can see that we're putting real effort into developing a suite of restorative therapeutics. And we're excited to see those discovery efforts result in three potential medicines so far. Of course, we'll have to see which of these deliver on our target clinical profiles but we're optimistic about this early phase portfolio, and we've certainly diversified the modalities in our pipeline. In addition, we're excited that [ph]alomorasib, our KRASG12C inhibitor, has progressed into Phase II as we're finalizing dose selection under Project Optimus for the Phase III program, which we plan to start later this year. You can now see the full design of that study on clinicaltrials.gov. By way of reminder, we started this program years behind our competitors. And through focused effort behind what looks like a great molecule to us, we've made up the vast majority of that time. We believe we're now neck and neck with our closest competitors with a medicine that we hope to show combines better with PD-1. Lastly, in oncology, we terminated development of our RET inhibitor two as it did not meet our threshold to move forward with internal development. In immunology, we moved two new assets into Phase I, and we advanced our KV1.3 Antagonist for psoriasis into Phase II. Lebrikizumab was approved in the EU for atopic dermatitis under the brand name Akouos, which is marketed by our partner, Amaral there. In January this year, we were pleased to have Akouos approved in Japan. In neuroscience, in January, our wholly-owned subsidiary announced positive clinical results for the Phase I/II AK-OTOF-101 study which demonstrated hearing restoration within 30 days of a single administration in the first participant, an individual with more than a decade of profound hearing loss. The surgical administration and the investigational therapy were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. These results highlight our commitment to help solve some of humanity's most challenging health care problems and make life better for individual patients. We now show OTP gene therapy in Phase II on our pipeline chart as we've begun enrolling younger patients in the Phase II portion of the study. On Slide 18, we highlight our select pipeline assets with updates since the last earnings call, and Slide 19 summarizes our key events for 2023. I note the key updates on each of these slides in my therapeutic area of comments. Turning to Slide 20. We'd like to highlight potential key events for 2024. As you can see, this year will be another important year as we look to progress our late-stage pipeline. In 2023, we initiated Phase III development projects for our next generation of Incretins, which are our oral agent glyprone and our novel weekly Injectable Tri-agonist, Retatrutide. These programs are progressing and enrolling well. We look forward to seeing the first set of Phase III results on next year. This year, we're planning to initiate a Phase III program in Type 2 diabetes for retatrutide, complementing the ongoing trials in obesity and related complications. Also this year, we are planning to initiate a Phase III program for Lepodiserin, our LPA-lowering siRNA therapy in cardiovascular disease. On Tirzepatide, we're looking forward to a number of additional key data readouts this year. Beyond SYNERGY-NASH, we expect to see results from the Phase III obstructive sleep apnea and Phase III heart failure studies this year. We note increased investor interest in the timing of SURPASS-CVOT, and we reiterate that we expect the data in 2025, notwithstanding the clinicaltrials.gov listing which will be updated soon to reflect our current assumptions based on event rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to have results of SURMOUNT 5, which is our head-to-head study of Tirzepatide compared to high-dose semaglutide in participants with obesity. We also expect the full Phase III program readout on our weekly basal insulin, insulin efsitora alfa alpha later this year. Moving to neuroscience. We're looking forward to FDA action and the potential launch of Erenumab in Q1 of this year, and we are progressing with regulatory reviews around the world. We've now launched a PT 217 blood-based diagnostic test, and we will continue to scale this throughout 2024. We'll also continue to partner with others in the field to ensure physicians have multiple tools to aid in timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In immunology, following the Mirikizumab positive Phase III data at Crohn's disease, we plan to submit to the FDA for this indication this year. Additionally, following the U.S. FDA complete response letter on Lebrikizumab, we expect regulatory action by the end of the year in the U.S. Finally, in oncology, as I mentioned before, we look forward to moving our KRASG12C inhibitor Olomorasib, Phase III later this year following Phase II dose selection. Lastly, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our inlinesterat Phase III study, EMBER-3 in participants with metastatic breast cancer in both monotherapy and in combination with Verzenio. This past year was busy and productive, and we expect more of the same in 2024 as we make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline for the benefit of patients. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Dan, and congrats to you and the team for a big year. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum. We achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approvals of Zepbound and Jaypirca. We continue to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, early phase capabilities and in business development, all of which will serve as a foundation for future growth. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and announced plans to build a new manufacturing site in Germany. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders via dividend. Lastly, in January, we announced that Jana Norton, our Executive Vice President of Global Quality, will be retiring at the end of July after 34 years of service. During her tenure, Jana has overseen significant expansion, modernization and improvements in our quality and manufacturing processes. I'd like to thank her for her many years of outstanding service to Lilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate our Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. Before diving into Q&A, I wanted to clarify one point. We may have had some muffled sound during announced prepared remarks. regarding the timing of regulatory action on Donanemab. And as Dan mentioned, the timing is expected to be Q1 of 2024 this year. Received some notes that there were some muffled sound, so I just wanted to clarify from that important point. Now for Q&A, we'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. So consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller so ask you limit to one question per caller, and we'll end the call at 11:15 a.m. [Operator Instructions] Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on the progress. Just wondering for your GLP franchise, ex U.S., you under-index versus your key competitor. Just wondering what are some of the hurdles to closing that gap as we think about the ramp in '24 but also into 2025?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Terence, for the question. I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International for that question.\nIlya Yuffa: Thanks, Terence. As we think about Mounjaro launches outside the U.S., we have already launched in a number of select markets. We have foundation to be competitive in many of our markets, and we anticipate continued launches. We've just launched in vial format in select markets outside of the U.S., mainly in Australia, Canada and Germany, and Poland. And we just received QuickPen approval in the U.K., and so we're anticipating launch there. As we get additional regulatory approvals for a multi-use QuickPen and we monitor our ramp-up in capacity for supply, we'll continue to launch in other markets throughout the year. And so we anticipate further growth, anticipated four launches of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. and continue with that throughout the year as well as into 2025.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\nChristopher Schott: All right, great. Thanks so much. On Zepbound, seems like you're making strong progress on coverage but just interested in expectations for the remainder of this year as we think about just where coverage could go and just how to think about ASP. I guess the core question is, is it reasonable to think that most payers who cover will add Zepbound year?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Patrik to comment on that question about Zepbound coverage.\nPatrik Jonsson: Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. As we stated, we are pleased we are so early in launch with the 35% commercial access, having contract a and Our efforts moving forward will really be to continue to expand payer access but not only we will do that with a very disciplined approach as we did with Mounjaro but also to make sure that we get to employer opt-in. And as Anat alluded to in her prepared remarks, that's going to take some time. But we are assuming that with the current access we have, that our access will be along the lines of what the competition has referred to, around 50%. Let me just emphasize that when it comes to employer opt-in, there is not one reliable source for employer opt-in. So I think that's something that we need to continue to monitor and we'll come back with more data during coming earnings calls. So overall, a good start and we will continue our efforts to increase payer access. I think we are quite encouraged with what we have heard from the marketplace so far. Employer opt-in will take longer, but we believe that we are well positioned in that regard as well.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\nSeamus Fernandez: Oh, thanks very much and congrats on all the progress and the success here. But I just wanted to add a quick sense from Dan. Do you see a prospect from SYNERGY-NASH for accelerated approval? And can you confirm that while clinically significant, the secondary endpoint of fibrosis age improvement was not statistically significant?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Seamus, for the question. Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Seamus. This is really quite new to us but we're really excited about it. We haven't had a chance yet to talk to the FDA here at all about next steps, but we're looking forward to having that opportunity. Of course, this was a small trial of about 190 participants but it did use liver biopsies, of course, to assess the endpoints here. With respect to the improvement in I think probably previously stated that I was unsure whether it would be possible for Incretin-based therapies to reverse fibrosis in patients based on competitor readouts in the field. But really excited to see this data with clinically meaningful improvement in fibrosis. There's different doses. There's different statistical methods that can be applied here, accounting for dropouts, particularly in placebo group. So have to wait for the scientific presentation to see all the p-values there. But we're pretty positive on this data package as a whole and what this could mean for patients, both in terms of stopping progression of MASH and reversing fibrosis.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umar, your line is live.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Dave, as you think about manufacturing build-out in various sites, which is obviously very important for all the existing GLP demand, I'm curious, how are you balancing that dollar investment with your probabilities on orfoglipron's clinical and commercial, especially with all the blinded data that's coming in?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Umer. Dave?\nDavid Ricks: Yes, happy to answer that. Of course, as we enter this phase of really strong growth in the Incretins, we're very focused on allocating capital, but top priority is creating new capacities. The gating factors are not really financial for us right now, so you can expect us to be investing fully. We're not slowing down because of cash flow or whatever. It's really a function of the technical capacities, both in people and in suppliers to be able to bring facilities online. That's particularly true in the parenteral side. Now you're referencing Orforglipron. Here, we do plan to build ahead of Phase III at risk. I think, given the probability we assess internally as well as the opportunity on the other side of a positive Phase III, we see that as a wise investment. And as we've commented on before, it relies, as you would know, on very different assets inside Lilly as well as outside of Lilly. So here you have organic chemistry, API and tablets and capsules, so a pretty different setup. So we can -- we're paralleling that with our robust injectable investments. And if we're wrong, okay, we'll have to eat that in the end for isn't a strong product. But if it is, I think it does begin to change the math on supply in this category, and I think that's about worth taking.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\nTimothy Anderson: Oh, thanks. On SURPASS-CVOT, you mentioned it slipped to 2025. I assume that implies the one interim look has come and gone. And then you're evaluating both non-inferiority and superiority. Would you agree that superiority is really what you need to show here and what you're confident in achieving that?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim, for those couple of questions. Maybe we'll field the one on the interim look, Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, sure. Well, thanks for that question, Tim. As you know, Lilly doesn't comment on interims. Probably most trials in our portfolio do have opportunities for interim looks. But that has -- is not, I think, germane at all to the question on the timing on clintrials.gov, which was before and continues to be the time point at which we'll have final data. When we initially put that time point in clinicaltrials.gov was in early 2020, we hadn't started enrolling the trial yet so that was based on our assumption on enrollment rates but probably more importantly on event rates. And as the trial matures, we get a view on event rate. So I know it's frustrating for investors and for us perhaps to wait to longer time to get events, but of course, that's great news for patients when the event rates are slower, remembering that this is a head-to-head trial with a drug Trulicity that we already know is active in preventing\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question and going back in the progress. I have a question regarding your sleep apnea study. How much benefit do you think from baseline is required for this to be clinically meaningful? Is it 50% or more? And do you think the trial is big enoughto seek a label in [indiscernible]\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Dan, back to you.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, thanks. There isn't really a well-established threshold for clinical meaningfulness in sleep apnea. Of course, the commonly used measure here is an index of how many apneic or hypoxic events a patient has while sleeping. Certainly, drugs in this category, I think, have great potential to improve that. We're excited to see what Tirzepatide can see, probably in addition to the absolute percent improvement in AHI that we'll be looking for, I'd also like to see patients switching from one category, for example, intermediate to mild disease or things like that. So we'll be looking at a number of things to assess clinical meaningfulness here, but I'm quite optimistic.\nOperator: The next question is from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise, your line is live.\nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how you think about sizing the downstream opportunities for GLP-1 such as Tirzepatide, maybe in NASH, some of the other indications that you're going after as well.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Louise, for that question. So about the downstream opportunities in NASH and elsewhere, Patrik, do you want to field that?\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much. I think there are two important aspects. The first one is when we refer to employer opt-in. I think employees are really looking actively into benefits of listing anti-obesity medications. And whatever data we can generate here being in the cardiovascular space, being in of being national average indications will be extremely important for increased employer opt-in. The second piece will be in Medicare Part D. As long as is not passed, I think data in those comorbidities will be critical to enable access for patients in Medicare Part D. So those are truly the key drivers for those indications.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\nKerry Holford: Thank you for taking my question. It's on Tirzepatide obesity. I'm interested to hear why you've taken the decision not to launch under the Zepbound brand outside the U.S. but rather seek a label expansion for weight loss to Mounjaro. Does that relate to simplicity, perhaps faster reimbursement access? And I wonder if you foresee any risk here that ex U.S. governments prefer ultimately to keep diabetes and obesity budgets separate.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Kerry, for the questions. I'll hand over to Ilya to talk about the branding of Tirzepatide OUS.\nIlya Yuffa: Sure, yes. So the broader Tirzepatide outside of the U.S., it depends on a number of different factors, whether it's regulatory or competitive market dynamics. There are some payer dynamics as well. We don't anticipate that being a challenge in terms of negotiating reimbursement either for Type 2 diabetes or for management. We continue to have those discussions in a number of markets and are optimistic about our ability to commercialize under different brand scenarios.\nOperator: The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Geoff, your line is live.\nGeoffrey Meacham: Morning, guys. Thanks so much for the question.Dave, I know you guys formally announced Lilly Direct last fall. Should we view it as a platform to just streamline access to providers and Lilly meds? Or is there a monetization model or some market differentiation that could also play out over time?\nDavid Ricks: For that I can start, Patrik, jump in. Yes, thanks for the question. The idea was really actually borne out of the challenges patients face every day in the U.S. and sometimes seeing doctors. And you'll know we have a Doctor Finder tool as well as telehealth partners on the platform for migraine, diabetes, and obesity. Finding medicines and their pharmacies, that's been a challenge. And I think particularly as supplies are tight, many patients report driving to 5, 6, seven pharmacies to find the medicine they need that simplifies that process. And then I think in addition, there's been a lot of noise about drugs that are illicit or copies or compounded versions of Zepbound or other weight loss drugs and that's concerning to us. And I think it's concerning to patients. So by going to Lilly Direct literally, they have confidence in the supply. And finally, application of our savings programs has also been a challenge at the pharmacy counter and that happens 100% of the time on Lilly Direct. We haven't thought about it as a way to create some new retail distribution business. It's a way to serve the patients that want our medicines better. That's sort of the frame we're in now. Early days. We're trying to develop it to be smoother, better, include more products over time, have better information about physicians and telehealth providers. So look for more developments there, but good start so far. A lot of energy and enthusiasm from the patient community.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink. David, your line is live.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thank you and congrats on today's updates. Congrats on today's updates. So my question is for Dave and Dan on lean muscle loss associated with Incretin use. Could you help me understand Lilly's take on this debate and comment on Tirzepatide data to date relative to semaglutide? What I've observed is that SURMOUNT-1 showed a 3:1 lean muscle loss ratio, whereas SEMA's STEP one trial showed a 1.5:1 ratio, albeit with a slightly different assessment.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. I'll have Dan field that.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks for your question. Maybe just starting with our take on lean versus fat mass. I think the ratio of lean to fat mass is an important thing to think about. Body composition, not by weight matters to patients, for example, in risk of Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that ratio seems to be important. The good news is that for patients on Tirzepatide, that ratio appears to improve. As you pointed out, they lose far more fat mass than lean mass. And so in every trial we've done, at the end of the trial, if we measure body composition, it's better, a higher ratio of lean to fat than at the beginning of the trial. So we see this changing body composition as a benefit, potential benefit of Tirzepatide to be further explored. Of course, it's also a benefit we want to further extend. You've seen us try to improve the total amount of body weight loss. We're also trying to improve further improve, I should say, the change in body mass composition. And that's why you saw us acquire and experiment with drugs like [indiscernible] the number you quote from the Tirzepatide and semaglutide studies seem right to me. Of course, they're not head-to-head studies. But it does raise a question here about whether there's a potential benefit of GIP-1 -- GIP agonism here in addition to GLP-1 agonism. That's probably the way I would interpret this data.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\nEvan Seigerman: I would love to get your take on how you're thinking about the opportunity for the oral GLP-1s. We've seen some mixed data from competitors. And I just would love to get how you see this evolving in context of your investment in orforglipron.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan, for the question. Patrik, maybe you talk about how we think about an oral agent.\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much. When we look at the opportunity in obesity, we have more than 110 million in the U.S. and 650 million globally. I think taking into account the current supply constraints across markets, it's impossible to reach all of those with injectables. So I think that's the big opportunity we have for orforglipron. And what we have seen so far in Phase II, if we can replicate those data in Phase III, we have an oral medicine here with a weight loss along the lines of the best competitive Incretin, not at the level of Tirzepatide, but that's the level of the best Incretin in the marketplace and with no food or water restrictions. So we really see the opportunity here with orforglipron to reach patients across the globe. And there is another component as well. If we look at the current market, approximately 20% of patients with obesity are actually concerned to take an injectable. So that's another opportunity with orforglipron. So we believe that's a really strong drug in our hands moving forward in the space of chronic weight management.\nOperator: Next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\nStephen Scala: There could be several reasons why Lilly is not initiating a Phase III trial of Tirzepatide in NASH. First, Lilly believes it has better molecules. Second, there is something in the Phase II data which is less than ideal. Or third, Lilly will do a Phase III. It just hasn't gotten around to finalizing plans, but that really can't be yet. To draw a parallel, you're starting a Phase III with LPA without even telling us the Phase II was positive. So what would be best for us to conclude about Tirzepatide and NASH?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the clever analysis here. So first of all, I should just say, we literally just got this Phase II data so give us a chance to determine our next steps on the plans, probably debug at least one of the hypotheses here. There's nothing bad in the data that would stop us from going to Phase III. In terms of having a better molecule, probably we do in -- of course, we don't have that kind of Phase II data here for retatrutide. And so that's based on liver fat reduction, which was just incredible in the Phase II trial. Still though, I think having a positive Phase II trial here with really a meaningful data and NASH obligates us to think about next steps. As I said, that's going to the FDA to talk to them. I would say in terms of planning a Phase III for any drug in NASH, a really important priority for us is to move away as much as we can from liver biopsies and replace them with non-invasive testing. I think we and others in the field have made a lot of progress there. We see analogies here to other disease areas. And we hope that in the future, it will be possible to conduct Phase III NASH trials without relying on biopsies. That would really have a profound effect on the feasibility of running these trials quickly but also in the clinical application of NASH drugs, where those non-invasive biomarkers could be identified patients for treatment and monitor response to therapy rather than biopsies.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live.\nChris Shibutani: Duration of use of the GLP-1s across the diabetes and obesity populations. Previously, you've characterized the duration in the range of 15 months for diabetes and have commented that you don't believe we have enough experience. Any updates there? And when do you think we will have enough experience to be able to get a better gauge of duration of use median in the obesity population, at least initially?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. Patrik, do you want to comment on duration of therapy?\nPatrik Jonsson: Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. I think you're right. It's quite challenging. It's still early days with both Mounjaro in particular Zepbound, and we have been facing some specific dynamics in terms of supply and also changes to the co-pay program. However, when we look at the recent data for Mounjaro, it's encouraging and it suggests that patients that start therapy back in Q1 2023 are having a persistency at least along the lines of other injectable Incretins. For Zepbound, definitely too early. But we strongly believe that patients will be motivated when they see the benefits of the drug. And there will, of course, be many factors impacting both supply, macroeconomic and microeconomic, but we are convinced that there will be a final duration of treatment also for obesity since when we look into even [indiscernible] in Type 2 diabetes, more than a 12-month period of adherence is considered long. But encouraging data in Type 2 diabetes so far. And with Zepbound, we will see, that will for sure be an end of duration based upon what we have seen in other chronic diseases, but we believe that the features itself will be motivating for patients.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.\nAkash Tewari: So David, at JPMorgan, you made an interesting comment on orforglipron, where you mentioned the molecule has lots to prove here. Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by this? And what's your confidence on orfo's CDI profile? It seems to have a bit of CYP3A4 inhibition. So will this drug be able to get dosed with SGLT2s, given they were excluded in some of your earlier studies?\nDavid Ricks: I would frame like why I said that, but maybe Specific DDI question in the SGLT2 coadministration. I just said that because we're just starting the Phase III. And we all know small molecule, there's a bit of empiricism in terms of eliminating safety risk. And of course, every day, as we expose more patients to the drug and we have higher doses, that's a good day where we don't announce that the drug has a problem. At some point, we reached a lot of confidence. We just weren't at that point. We're not at it now. I think we're running the Phase III experiment and we need to discharge the off-target safety that is inherent in small molecule discovery, and we've seen in this class from others. But nothing specific on my mind. Maybe Dan can further reassure us.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Dave, of course, that's just the normal Phase III types of risk, new safety signals, which could always arise. I think with respect to DDI and coadministration with SGLT2s, we expect that to be possible, and we have that ongoing in our Phase III trials. There are patients who achieve -- will be just with our base for orforglipron as well as other drugs like SGLT2s.\nOperator: The next question is from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\nTrung Huynh: Can I just ask your thoughts on GIP agonism versus antagonism, given data yesterday from a competitor suggesting more limited effects on things like blood pressure and lipid modifications. Just how differentiated do you think an agonism approach is versus antagonism and why you think agonism is the way forward?\nJoe Fletcher: Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Well, first of all, it's an unfair comparison. We have so much data now on the benefits of GIP agonism from tens of thousands of participants in randomized clinical trials for Tirzepatide. So we're extremely confident here about the benefits of GIP agonism. Adding to that data, we have experimented with a pure GIP one agonist that doesn't have any GLP-1 and we reported the benefits there in our Phase I study. We're contrasting that here to a small Phase I study that was recently published with a drug that has both GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism. I noted in that publication, the GIP antagonism is at a much lower affinity. So it probably only starts to antagonize GIP at very high doses. It's probably a question for that company. But I noted at the high doses actually an increase in free fatty acids and complete attenuation of the decrease in triglycerides in the clinical trial. Those are some effects that we attribute to GIP.  And so I'm not surprised that antagonism of GIP is starting to have some negative effects once that kicks in. We also see GIP agonism as having positive benefits on tolerability, reducing potentially nausea and vomiting. Then again, I think maybe at the higher doses, you could probably see some hints of the opposite effect with antagonism. So pretty glad with the decision we took, and let's see how the field continues to evolve.\nOperator: The next question is from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live.\nCarter Gould: I guess over the prior two earnings calls, there have been at least an acknowledgment that CMOs were going to be part of the equation going forward for supply on the Incretin side. I guess, does the development fee yesterday have any sort of direct or indirect impacts as you think about that part of the equation going forward?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Carter. Anat, do you want to field that?\nAnat Ashkenazi: Sure. So we've, and I've mentioned on this call as well that we have very expensive expansion agenda, which does include third parties. While our strategy is and has always been to develop more internally, we do have third parties as well. So we saw the announcement that came out from NOVO yesterday regarding the intent to acquire Catalent. And we certainly have questions about that transaction and need to learn more. And we don't know, Catalent is an integral part or a manufacturer of both commercial and pipeline products for the industry especially in diabetes and obesity, and we have products with these sites as well. So our focus today is on ensuring that the continuity of supply of medicine for patients is uninterrupted as well as we intend on holding Catalent accountable to their contract with us as we look and we gain more information on this proposed transaction.\nOperator: The next question is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. James, your line is live.\nJames Shin: I just want to circle back to Carter's question. Given Lilly is well-capitalized and manufacturing capacity being the priority, I mean, could you expect more buy versus build to get around some of the technical bottlenecks and the nontrivial FDA process? I just want to get your thoughts there.\nJoe Fletcher: Dave?\nDavid Ricks: Yes, maybe I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the question, James. As I mentioned on the earlier question related to Orforglipron, we are not -- we don't think of ourselves as capital-constrained, buying or building in the space. The reality is there just isn't built capacity that's available. Most of it that's being used is already deployed against the leading products in the GLP-1 space, at least any at scale and new capacity has a lead time of three to four years. So all of the things that are coming online now, like we mentioned today, are very large site in Concord, North Carolina. That's a big node of capacity for the sector and certainly for Lilly. I mean, that was announced two and a half years ago and it will just begin production at the end of this year. So that's the problem. And why is that? Well, of course, greenfield building is difficult, repurposing is difficult, but also these are technically complex facilities. There's not an infinite number of people who know how to set them up. And the supply chain for the machines that make the products is also constrained. So at this point, I don't think there's an easy way forward. And I think even in yesterday's announcements, we have a lot of questions about that. But I think even the purchaser or our competitors said it will take many years for them to be able to increase capacity within that purchase. So it's just not an easy problem to solve. I think that over time, it will ease. There'll be more capacity brought online by us, our competitor and maybe others, including third parties and new technology will emerge like Orforglipron or other oral options, that tap into a different asset base. So I know it's frustrating for investors, it's frustrating for us. It's even more frustrating for patients but it's just sort of the situation we're in is that we steady gains in manufacturing over the coming several years and perhaps bigger gains after that.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Dave. Our next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Rajesh Kumar from HSBC. Rajesh, your line is live.\nRajesh Kumar: Hi there. Can you give us some color on, you know, how the access with employers is playing out? Are you getting exclusive access for your drugs or you're being added to the existing access your competitors' drugs have? And what is the nature of discussion, especially given that, you know, the pound is priced at a more attractive list price? I'm assuming with rebate, the differences might be a bit smaller, but any color there might be super helpful.\nJoe Fletcher: Yeah. Thanks, Rajesh. I think we covered that in Chris Schott's question earlier. I don't know if Patrick has anything to add or if we could just move on.\nPatrik Jonsson: I think the only addition would be that we are always aiming for open access. We believe that's important for the providers and the patients we are serving. So that's going to be our aim when it comes to employer opt-in as well. And we believe a move by pricing set down 22% below the competition, despite launching with a best-in-class profile, is also a good signal for increased and enhanced employer opt-in.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Patrick. Paul, next question. We have time for maybe two more. Next question?\nOperator: Certainly. The next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi. Andrew, your line is live. \nAndrew Baum: Thank you. Could you talk to your scenario planning for post-2032 when the potential exists for generic somatocytes to be launched? There seems to be significant interest and investment in capacity expansion. Now, obviously, this is complex, as you outlined, given not just API, but fit and finish and IP and the rest of it. But I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of future-proofing your business against step edits and other thinking about your broader Inquity portfolio?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Andrew. It's a very long-term question. I'll pass over to Anat to talk about 2032 and beyond.\nAnat Ashkenazi: We do look at 2032, and we actually do look beyond. And the way we look at our business, it is a long-term business. It's not a business that changes every year or two. So we do look at the long-term horizon, both in terms of the commercial products as well as what's coming through the pipeline and as we think through the events of that next freeze, whether for our products or those of competitors, our way of managing through that is to bring new breakthrough innovation to the marketplace. So to raise the bar on our own innovation, we don't wait for that to occur or happen by competition, but to bring something into the market that provides a meaningfully improved outcome for patients. So in this specific example, you use the GLTs, Shirley True's appetite brought in a higher bar for weight loss for patients with chronic weight management. And [indiscernible], that Dan referenced in his comments, currently in Phase III has the potential to bring even further improved outcome for patients. So that's how we see that. In terms of capacity and one of the questions is on whether companies should be or shouldn't be building, given that there is a patent expiry at the end, we do look at that and we look at the long-term horizon. But certainly, the investments in a metro facility, for example, the ones we've just mentioned, whether it's in Concord, North Carolina or Research Triangle Park, between the two of them, it's about a $4 billion investment, are certainly a good investment of our capital, given that size of opportunity over the long term. I will say that as you think about potential for either generic or biosimilar entry in this space, in general, it will require quite a massive investment in capital. Just the sites that I've mentioned today in the call and we've talked about for the past year or so total about $11 billion, and that's on top of already substantial network we have around the globe, primarily in the U.S. and Europe for production. So as you think about entering into that space, it will require some significant capital commitments.\nJoe Fletcher: Maybe a final question, Paul, and then we'll wrap up.\nOperator: The next question is from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\nTimothy Anderson: So one of the competitor data, obviously, everyone is watching as the Amgen data this year. And their messaging is around longer dosing frequency, monthly dosing and then possibly a greater effect of weight loss off-therapy. So can you comment on your views of the value of extended dosing like monthly or longer? And then do you believe in that argument about efficacy being sustained off-therapy? Or is that just a function of the fact that this drug lasts longer?\nJoe Fletcher: Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: I'll start with the second, and then maybe Patrik will weigh in on potential value here although that could be a good question for Amgen. Look, I think the sustainability data I saw in that publication are a bit underwhelming. It's a very high-dose drug at half-life of an antibody. So just based on plasma concentrations, that would be extended to -- expected to remain there after a month or two. It doesn't surprise me, but what we're seeing is that at doses that are reasonably well tolerated, if there were any doses that are reasonably well tolerated, weight loss is lower than what we would need to see to take a molecule to Phase III for sure. And sustainability doesn't appear to be at all differentiated.\nPatrik Jonsson: Only addition would be that when we look at the market research, of course, convenience is one factor, but it's not necessarily the most important factor when it comes to provider and consumer selecting treatment. So I'm really excited about the we have in our hands. Of course, Tirzepatide remaining a foundational treatment for obesity, but also with the addition of orforglipron and also the opportunities here to look into options with additional non-weight loss-dependent pharmacology to complement the assets we have in the pipeline.\nJoe Fletcher: Dave, do you want to wrap this up?\nA - David Ricks: Yes, absolutely. That's good, Joe. Thanks. We appreciate everyone participating today and, of course, your interest in the company. 2023 was a really productive year for Lilly, and we look forward to continued momentum in 2024 with a strong guide today. Thanks again for dialing in. And please follow up with Joe and the IR team if you have additional questions that weren't answered. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.

We are pleased with the strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our performance was highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, driven by our new products and growth products. Q4 revenue increased 28% compared to Q4 2022. Excluding divestiture, this represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance and the recent launch of Zepbound. For the full year, revenue increased 20% driven by robust volume growth of 16%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 82.3%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 17%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with launches of new products and additional indications as well as higher incentive compensation costs. R&D expenses increased 28%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as higher incentive compensation costs. In Q4, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $623 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.62. In Q4 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $240 million or $0.23 negative impact to EPS. Operating income increased 29% in Q4, driven by higher revenue from new launches, partially offset by operating expense growth. Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 28% for the quarter and included a negative impact of approximately seven percentage points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges. Our Q4 effective tax rate was 13.1% compared to 7.3% in Q4 2022. The higher effective tax rate for Q4 2023 was primarily driven by a lower net discrete tax benefit compared to the same period in 2022 and the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.49 in Q4, a 19% increase compared to Q4 2022, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.62 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.23 in Q4 2022. On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 39% in Q4, driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Zepbound. Net price in the U.S. increased 27% for the quarter, driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamic as well as the onetime favorable change in estimates for rebates and discounts. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. Europe continued its trend of strong growth in Q4. Excluding $65 million in revenue associated with milestones received for the EU approval and launch of Revenue was up 11% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. For Japan, we are pleased to see robust growth in Q4 as revenue increased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Verzenio and Mounjaro. Moving to China, Q4 revenue increased 7% in constant currency with volume growth of 10% partially offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q4 was primarily driven by Pivot. We are pleased to see China return to growth in 2023. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 10% in constant currency. However, when you exclude the impact of the Q4 2022 sales of rights for Alimta Korea and Taiwan, sales grew 9% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Slide nine shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see, the new products and growth product categories combined contributed approximately 15 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 42% in Q4 driven by robust demand growth and, to a lesser extent, higher realized prices. The continued positive momentum is driven by early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 30% for the quarter. In the U.S., Jardiance revenue increased 29%, driven by increased demand. In Q4, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 14%. U.S. revenue decreased 18% driven by lower volume and lower realized prices. We experienced intermittent delays for filling orders of Trulicity. Starting in early December and going through January, all dose strengths of Trulicity were indicated as having limited availability on the FDA drug shortage site. We expect to experience intermittent delays orders of certain doses in the coming months. In international markets, Trulicity volume continued to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to start new patients on Trulicity. Moving to Slide 11, Mounjaro continued its robust growth as more Type 2 diabetes patients benefited from the medicine. Q4 revenue grew to over $2.2 billion globally, up from $1.4 billion in Q3 2023. In the U.S., Mounjaro revenue of $2.1 billion in Q4, up from $1.3 billion in Q3 2023, benefited from a onetime change in SMS for rebates and discounts. Adjusted for this onetime change, sequential net sales in the U.S. would have grown approximately 30% in Q4. Since our last call, we further expanded patient access to Mounjaro. As of February 1, access for patients with Type 2 diabetes in the U.S. was 90% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 92% access for commercial patients. This expanded access puts Mounjaro near parity with established injectable Incretins and gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for Type 2 diabetes. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay part program expired on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. Compared to Q4 2022, the Mounjaro net price in Q4 2023 benefited from this change to the co-pay part program in the U.S. Recall that after a change to the noncovered co-pay program in late 2022, patients already started on the $25 co-pay card could remain in the program until June 30. Today, commercially insured patients without coverage utilize the current noncovered co-pay program and pay roughly half the list price for Mounjaro prescription. Turning to Slide 12. In November, we received FDA approval for Zepbound for adults with obesity or those who are overweight and have weight-related comorbidities. We then announced on December five that Zepbound available at U.S. pharmacies, and we started building commercial formulary access before the end of the year. We are pleased with the early access of approximately one-third of commercial lives covered as of February 1. Access in this market will be more gradual as individual employers need to opt in to coverage after the typical formulary contracting takes place. We are focused on building formulary access and employer opt-ins, but we expect that it will take some time before we reach broad open access in this market. Meanwhile, the commercial savings for our program is available at U.S. pharmacies for those who do not yet have coverage. In Medicare Part D, weight loss drugs are still prohibited from reimbursement. In Q4, we recognized $176 million in sales for Zepbound with approximately 3/4 of that coming from initial channel stocking. The initial prescription trends we have seen are encouraging. On Slide 13, we provide an update on capital allocation. Looking forward to 2024 and beyond, we have confidence in our existing commercial portfolio, bolstered by the recent launches of Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, and Zepbound and the potential launches of the Donanemab and Lebrikizumab, all of which we expect to serve as drivers for contained growth through the balance of the decade. On Slide 14, you'll see a summary of our outlook; outline our capital deployment decisions in relation to achievement of our strategic deliverables. We will invest in our current portfolio and in the future innovation through R&D, business development and a comprehensive manufacturing expansion agenda designed to drive revenue growth and speed life-changing medicines to patients. We will continue to return capital to our shareholders through dividend increases in line with earnings growth over time and share repurchases with excess capital. Moving to Slide 15, we highlight some of the dynamics that may impact our 2024 financial results. We expect continued robust revenue growth with revenue from our core business which excludes revenue from divestiture growing nearly 30% at the midpoint of our guidance range, driven by positive momentum to simply launch products. In Incretins, anticipated growth will be led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. In 2023, we made tremendous strides in expanding access from Mounjaro, and we entered 2024 with 90% of commercial and Part D lives covered. Zepbound coverage is off to a good start in its early December launch, and we expect both Tirzepatide to contribute substantially to Lilly's revenue growth in 2024. While we expect Mounjaro and Zepbound to be drivers of revenue growth, this will be partially offset by an expected continuation of the softer Trulicity sales trends that we saw in the second half of 2023. Recent revenue declines for Trulicity in the U.S. has been driven by supply tightness. Volume has also been impacted by our actions outside the U.S. As for supply outlook for Emberton, our manufacturer organization continues to execute well on the most ambitious expansion agenda in our company's long history. Given strong demand and time required to bring capacity fully online, we continue to expect demand to outpace supply in 2024. In late 2022, we showed our expectation that by year-end 2023, our capacity for Incretin auto-injector pens would double. This goal was achieved through significant efforts from our manufacturing colleagues and partners around the globe. In 2024, our capacity execution efforts will continue with equal urgency and will be accomplished not just through increased auto-injector capacity but also through alternative presentation like our multi-use Quick Pen, which received regulatory approval in the U.K. in late January. We expect our manufacturing site in Concord, North Carolina, will initiate production as early as the end of 2024, with product available to ship in 2025. And we are pursuing a host of the projects, internal and external, large and small, to further expand capacity. Now I'll provide a bit more context on the timing and pace of our Incretin supply plans in 2024. While we're continuing to expand supply every quarter, we expect the most significant production increases to come in the second half of the year. We expect our production of sellable doses in the second half of 2024 will be at least one and a half times the production in the second half of 2023. Note that while last year, our commentary focused on capacity of auto-injectors devices compared to 2022, we're now referring sellable doses produced, which is more relevant to patients and investors. Beyond Incretin, we look forward to progressing our launch project for two other medicine approved and launched in 2023, Jaypirca and Omvoh. Jaypirca was initially approved by the FDA in January 2023 for adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma under the accelerated approval program, received FDA approval also on the Accelerated Approval Program in December 2023 for adult patients with CLL or SLL that have received at least two prior lines of therapy. We look forward to the ongoing opportunity to help patients with this medicine as our best Phase III program continues. Omvoh was approved in October 2023 in the U.S. and earlier that year in Japan, Europe and other markets and represents a compelling new options for patients struggling with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. And in 2024, we look forward to potential U.S. launches of two more medicines, Donanemab and Lebrikizumab. We continue to expect FDA regulatory actions on Donanemab in Q4 2024 and remain confident in the substantial potential for Donanemab to benefit patients with Alzheimer's disease. With the current state of diagnostic and treatment readiness, initial uptake will be somewhat limited, and we expect Donanemab to contribute only modestly to growth in 2024 once approved. Lebrikizumab, which last year was approved and launched in Europe under the brand name by our partner, received regulatory approval in Japan in January. As for the U.S., we look forward to the potential proof of Lebrikizumab by the end of the year. We believe the efficacy, safety and dosing of Lebrikizumab can make it a compelling option for patients and prescribers in a large and growing market for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Given the expected timing of FDA regulatory action, we expect Lebrikizumab to contribute only modestly to revenue growth in 2024. Beyond our recently launched portfolio of medicine, we expect continued growth from Verzenio driven by the early breast cancer indication where the magnitude and maturity of our clinical data reinforces it as a standard of care treatment in node-positive high-risk early breast cancer. Jardiance has been another outstanding contributor to growth, and we expect revenue growth to continue in 2024 though at a slower price as strong growth may be dampened by pricing dynamics in the U.S. Outside the U.S., we expect an acceleration of growth in every major geography led not only by the anticipated launches of Tirzepatide but also continued strong growth of Verzenio, Jardiance, and Taltz. Lastly, we seek to create long-term value beyond this decade. We will continue to invest across our value chain, in our recent and upcoming potential launches, in our pipeline, and in our manufacturing footprint. Slide 16 summarizes our initial 2024 financial guidance. Starting at the top line, revenue is expected to be between $40.4 billion and $41.6 billion. Using the midpoint of the 2024 range, this represents roughly 20% growth or 29% growth for our core business, which excludes the impact of divestitures that took place in 2023. In terms of phasing of our revenue growth throughout 2024, while we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, consistent with the increased availability of Incretin doses. In terms of pricing for our core business, which excludes divestitures, we expect a high single-digit percent price decline in 2024. The lingering base period impact of the Mounjaro non-covered co-pay card dynamics will dampen these price declines in the first half of 2024, with more significant price declines expected in the second half of the year. During this year, we are taking a streamlined approach to our guidance line items related to expenses. Rather than provide three separate guidance line items for gross margin, research and development costs and marketing and sale and administrative costs, we are presenting a single new ratio representing our margin after planned costs, calculated by subtracting R&D costs and marketing and administrative costs from gross margin and dividing that figure by revenue. We express this ratio as a percentage, and for 2024, we expect it to be in the range of 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis. While we are not providing a specific guidance number for gross margin as a percent of sales, our expectations remain consistent, but we will maintain gross margin of approximately 80% on a non-GAAP basis as productivity gains and volumes are offset by pricing pressures and the cost of new manufacturing facilities. As for our expense growth across key categories, we expect marketing and administrative expenses to again grow in 2024 though at a slower pace than revenues, with growth driven by marketing investments in our recently launched and upcoming launch products. We also expect R&D expenses in 2024 to increase, driven by growing investments across all phases of our pipeline as we invest for the future, with the majority of dollar growth driven by ongoing and new late-phase opportunities. We expect R&D expense to increase at a higher rate than marketing, sell and administrative expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million of expense, primarily driven by higher interest expense. Turning to taxes; we expect our 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 14%. Note that this rate does not assume or repeal of the provision of the 2017 Tax Act, requiring capitalization, amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes. Should such a change take effect, our effective tax rate for 2024 would be moderately higher. Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.70 on a non-GAAP basis. Consistent with our prior practice, we are not including any potential or pending acquired IPR&D and even milestone charges in our 2024 guidance, and we will provide updates each quarter from the impact of IPR&D on earnings per share as acquired IPR&D and development milestone charges are incurred. For guidance modelling purposes, we're currently estimating diluted weighted average share outstanding for 2024 to be approximately 903 million. We entered 2024 with strong momentum and a remarkable opportunity to help millions more patients with our medicines. For our investors, 2024 should be another exciting year, driven by expected revenue growth in our core business, near an approaching 30% and continued investments to drive future growth. Our outlook for top-tier revenue growth and operating margin expansion remains on track. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our continued progress in R&D. Sure. So we've, and I've mentioned on this call as well that we have very expensive expansion agenda, which does include third parties. While our strategy is and has always been to develop more internally, we do have third parties as well. So we saw the announcement that came out from NOVO yesterday regarding the intent to acquire Catalent. And we certainly have questions about that transaction and need to learn more. And we don't know, Catalent is an integral part or a manufacturer of both commercial and pipeline products for the industry especially in diabetes and obesity, and we have products with these sites as well. So our focus today is on ensuring that the continuity of supply of medicine for patients is uninterrupted as well as we intend on holding Catalent accountable to their contract with us as we look and we gain more information on this proposed transaction. We do look at 2032, and we actually do look beyond. And the way we look at our business, it is a long-term business. It's not a business that changes every year or two. So we do look at the long-term horizon, both in terms of the commercial products as well as what's coming through the pipeline and as we think through the events of that next freeze, whether for our products or those of competitors, our way of managing through that is to bring new breakthrough innovation to the marketplace. So to raise the bar on our own innovation, we don't wait for that to occur or happen by competition, but to bring something into the market that provides a meaningfully improved outcome for patients. So in this specific example, you use the GLTs, Shirley True's appetite brought in a higher bar for weight loss for patients with chronic weight management. And [indiscernible], that Dan referenced in his comments, currently in Phase III has the potential to bring even further improved outcome for patients. So that's how we see that. In terms of capacity and one of the questions is on whether companies should be or shouldn't be building, given that there is a patent expiry at the end, we do look at that and we look at the long-term horizon. But certainly, the investments in a metro facility, for example, the ones we've just mentioned, whether it's in Concord, North Carolina or Research Triangle Park, between the two of them, it's about a $4 billion investment, are certainly a good investment of our capital, given that size of opportunity over the long term. I will say that as you think about potential for either generic or biosimilar entry in this space, in general, it will require quite a massive investment in capital. Just the sites that I've mentioned today in the call and we've talked about for the past year or so total about $11 billion, and that's on top of already substantial network we have around the globe, primarily in the U.S. and Europe for production. So as you think about entering into that space, it will require some significant capital commitments."

            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. I'll start with our progress against diabetes, obesity and complications thereof. Today, we announced positive results from SYNERGY-NASH. The Phase II study of Tirzepatide in adults with biopsy-proven metabolic dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis, also known as MASH. As shown on Slide 17, the study met its primary endpoint with up to 74% of participants achieving an absence of MASH with no worsening of fibrosis at 52 weeks compared to less than 13% of participants reaching this endpoint on placebo. We are equally encouraged by results seen in the secondary endpoint, evaluating improvement in fibrosis. While the study was not designed to be statistically powered to evaluate improvement in fibrosis, the study results showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect across all doses on the proportion of participants achieving a decrease of at least one fibrosis stage with no worsening of MASH to placebo. The adverse events were consistent with those observed in other clinical trials studying Tirzepatide in people living with obesity or Type 2 Diabetes. The full SYNERGY-NASH results will be presented at a medical congress later this year. As you know, late last year, we received FDA approval on Zepbound, which marks Lilly's first approved treatment for obesity. This is a landmark occasion for patients and for the field as Zepbound is the first and only approved treatment activating two Incretin hormone receptors, GIP and GLP-1 to tackle on the underlying cause of excess weight. Also, in early-stage development, we have now advanced our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist for the treatment of diabetes into Phase I and our long-acting Atrial natriuretic peptide for treatment of heart failure into Phase I. We've advanced mastatide into Phase II for obesity as we've begun to dose patients in that study. We are pleased that early this year, our partner, Innovent, reported positive results in the Phase III GORE-I study of mastetide in Chinese adults with obesity. In helps the development and commercialization rights for in China and Lilly retains the rights to the rest of the world. Moving to oncology. Today, we shared that in the Phase III CYCLONE two trial, Verzenio added to abiraterone did not meet the primary endpoint of improved radiographic progression-free survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. For the study, we employ an adaptive Phase II/III design. And while the Phase II stage met the prespecified threshold for the independent data monitoring committee to recommend initiation of Phase III, the signal was not confirmed in the Phase III portion in a larger sample size. The overall safety and tolerability profile was consistent with the known profiles of the medicines. We anticipate sharing full results from the CYCLONE two study at a future medical meeting. Since our last earnings call, Jaypirca received approval under the FDA's Accelerated Approval program for the treatment of divergence with CLL or SLL who have received at least two prior lines of therapy, including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL2 inhibitor. We also reported that the Phase III confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval, known as BRUIN CLL 321 met its primary endpoint, and we plan to present these data at an upcoming medical meeting. With the CLL and SLL approvals, Jaypirca is now the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent BTK inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL and SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. This was the second approval for Jaypirca in 2023 with the first in patients with MCL. We believe these two indications only represent the beginning of the eventual impact Jaypirca can have for patients, and we look forward to seeing the data from the rest of the Phase III program across CLL, SLL and MCI. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, which begins Lilly's entry into radioligand therapy, a promising technology with potential to deliver meaningful advances against a range of cancers. We welcome our new Point colleagues to Lilly, and we look forward to building on their work to grow this capability at Lilly. 2024 is also poised to be a particularly productive year for new clinical starts in oncology, as we begin to see the results of the new oncology R&D strategy that we implemented about four years ago after the Loxo acquisition. Through a combination of internal discovery efforts and business development, we expect to put at least five new molecules into the clinic this year, a wild-type of selective KRASG12D inhibitor, a pan-KRAS inhibitor, two antibody-drug conjugates with two biasomere's payloads, one against Nectin-4 and one against folate receptor alpha and an actinium PSMA radioligand therapy. I'll speak in a moment about our clinical KRASG12C program, but you can see that we're putting real effort into developing a suite of restorative therapeutics. And we're excited to see those discovery efforts result in three potential medicines so far. Of course, we'll have to see which of these deliver on our target clinical profiles but we're optimistic about this early phase portfolio, and we've certainly diversified the modalities in our pipeline. In addition, we're excited that [ph]alomorasib, our KRASG12C inhibitor, has progressed into Phase II as we're finalizing dose selection under Project Optimus for the Phase III program, which we plan to start later this year. You can now see the full design of that study on clinicaltrials.gov. By way of reminder, we started this program years behind our competitors. And through focused effort behind what looks like a great molecule to us, we've made up the vast majority of that time. We believe we're now neck and neck with our closest competitors with a medicine that we hope to show combines better with PD-1. Lastly, in oncology, we terminated development of our RET inhibitor two as it did not meet our threshold to move forward with internal development. In immunology, we moved two new assets into Phase I, and we advanced our KV1.3 Antagonist for psoriasis into Phase II. Lebrikizumab was approved in the EU for atopic dermatitis under the brand name Akouos, which is marketed by our partner, Amaral there. In January this year, we were pleased to have Akouos approved in Japan. In neuroscience, in January, our wholly-owned subsidiary announced positive clinical results for the Phase I/II AK-OTOF-101 study which demonstrated hearing restoration within 30 days of a single administration in the first participant, an individual with more than a decade of profound hearing loss. The surgical administration and the investigational therapy were well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. These results highlight our commitment to help solve some of humanity's most challenging health care problems and make life better for individual patients. We now show OTP gene therapy in Phase II on our pipeline chart as we've begun enrolling younger patients in the Phase II portion of the study. On Slide 18, we highlight our select pipeline assets with updates since the last earnings call, and Slide 19 summarizes our key events for 2023. I note the key updates on each of these slides in my therapeutic area of comments. Turning to Slide 20. We'd like to highlight potential key events for 2024. As you can see, this year will be another important year as we look to progress our late-stage pipeline. In 2023, we initiated Phase III development projects for our next generation of Incretins, which are our oral agent glyprone and our novel weekly Injectable Tri-agonist, Retatrutide. These programs are progressing and enrolling well. We look forward to seeing the first set of Phase III results on next year. This year, we're planning to initiate a Phase III program in Type 2 diabetes for retatrutide, complementing the ongoing trials in obesity and related complications. Also this year, we are planning to initiate a Phase III program for Lepodiserin, our LPA-lowering siRNA therapy in cardiovascular disease. On Tirzepatide, we're looking forward to a number of additional key data readouts this year. Beyond SYNERGY-NASH, we expect to see results from the Phase III obstructive sleep apnea and Phase III heart failure studies this year. We note increased investor interest in the timing of SURPASS-CVOT, and we reiterate that we expect the data in 2025, notwithstanding the clinicaltrials.gov listing which will be updated soon to reflect our current assumptions based on event rate. By the end of 2024, we expect to have results of SURMOUNT 5, which is our head-to-head study of Tirzepatide compared to high-dose semaglutide in participants with obesity. We also expect the full Phase III program readout on our weekly basal insulin, insulin efsitora alfa alpha later this year. Moving to neuroscience. We're looking forward to FDA action and the potential launch of Erenumab in Q1 of this year, and we are progressing with regulatory reviews around the world. We've now launched a PT 217 blood-based diagnostic test, and we will continue to scale this throughout 2024. We'll also continue to partner with others in the field to ensure physicians have multiple tools to aid in timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In immunology, following the Mirikizumab positive Phase III data at Crohn's disease, we plan to submit to the FDA for this indication this year. Additionally, following the U.S. FDA complete response letter on Lebrikizumab, we expect regulatory action by the end of the year in the U.S. Finally, in oncology, as I mentioned before, we look forward to moving our KRASG12C inhibitor Olomorasib, Phase III later this year following Phase II dose selection. Lastly, we're looking forward to seeing the results of our inlinesterat Phase III study, EMBER-3 in participants with metastatic breast cancer in both monotherapy and in combination with Verzenio. This past year was busy and productive, and we expect more of the same in 2024 as we make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline for the benefit of patients. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Seamus. This is really quite new to us but we're really excited about it. We haven't had a chance yet to talk to the FDA here at all about next steps, but we're looking forward to having that opportunity. Of course, this was a small trial of about 190 participants but it did use liver biopsies, of course, to assess the endpoints here. With respect to the improvement in I think probably previously stated that I was unsure whether it would be possible for Incretin-based therapies to reverse fibrosis in patients based on competitor readouts in the field. But really excited to see this data with clinically meaningful improvement in fibrosis. There's different doses. There's different statistical methods that can be applied here, accounting for dropouts, particularly in placebo group. So have to wait for the scientific presentation to see all the p-values there. But we're pretty positive on this data package as a whole and what this could mean for patients, both in terms of stopping progression of MASH and reversing fibrosis. Yes, sure. Well, thanks for that question, Tim. As you know, Lilly doesn't comment on interims. Probably most trials in our portfolio do have opportunities for interim looks. But that has -- is not, I think, germane at all to the question on the timing on clintrials.gov, which was before and continues to be the time point at which we'll have final data. When we initially put that time point in clinicaltrials.gov was in early 2020, we hadn't started enrolling the trial yet so that was based on our assumption on enrollment rates but probably more importantly on event rates. And as the trial matures, we get a view on event rate. So I know it's frustrating for investors and for us perhaps to wait to longer time to get events, but of course, that's great news for patients when the event rates are slower, remembering that this is a head-to-head trial with a drug Trulicity that we already know is active in preventing Yes, thanks. There isn't really a well-established threshold for clinical meaningfulness in sleep apnea. Of course, the commonly used measure here is an index of how many apneic or hypoxic events a patient has while sleeping. Certainly, drugs in this category, I think, have great potential to improve that. We're excited to see what Tirzepatide can see, probably in addition to the absolute percent improvement in AHI that we'll be looking for, I'd also like to see patients switching from one category, for example, intermediate to mild disease or things like that. So we'll be looking at a number of things to assess clinical meaningfulness here, but I'm quite optimistic. Yes. Thanks for your question. Maybe just starting with our take on lean versus fat mass. I think the ratio of lean to fat mass is an important thing to think about. Body composition, not by weight matters to patients, for example, in risk of Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease, that ratio seems to be important. The good news is that for patients on Tirzepatide, that ratio appears to improve. As you pointed out, they lose far more fat mass than lean mass. And so in every trial we've done, at the end of the trial, if we measure body composition, it's better, a higher ratio of lean to fat than at the beginning of the trial. So we see this changing body composition as a benefit, potential benefit of Tirzepatide to be further explored. Of course, it's also a benefit we want to further extend. You've seen us try to improve the total amount of body weight loss. We're also trying to improve further improve, I should say, the change in body mass composition. And that's why you saw us acquire and experiment with drugs like [indiscernible] the number you quote from the Tirzepatide and semaglutide studies seem right to me. Of course, they're not head-to-head studies. But it does raise a question here about whether there's a potential benefit of GIP-1 -- GIP agonism here in addition to GLP-1 agonism. That's probably the way I would interpret this data. Yes. Thanks, Steve, for the clever analysis here. So first of all, I should just say, we literally just got this Phase II data so give us a chance to determine our next steps on the plans, probably debug at least one of the hypotheses here. There's nothing bad in the data that would stop us from going to Phase III. In terms of having a better molecule, probably we do in -- of course, we don't have that kind of Phase II data here for retatrutide. And so that's based on liver fat reduction, which was just incredible in the Phase II trial. Still though, I think having a positive Phase II trial here with really a meaningful data and NASH obligates us to think about next steps. As I said, that's going to the FDA to talk to them. I would say in terms of planning a Phase III for any drug in NASH, a really important priority for us is to move away as much as we can from liver biopsies and replace them with non-invasive testing. I think we and others in the field have made a lot of progress there. We see analogies here to other disease areas. And we hope that in the future, it will be possible to conduct Phase III NASH trials without relying on biopsies. That would really have a profound effect on the feasibility of running these trials quickly but also in the clinical application of NASH drugs, where those non-invasive biomarkers could be identified patients for treatment and monitor response to therapy rather than biopsies. Yes. Dave, of course, that's just the normal Phase III types of risk, new safety signals, which could always arise. I think with respect to DDI and coadministration with SGLT2s, we expect that to be possible, and we have that ongoing in our Phase III trials. There are patients who achieve -- will be just with our base for orforglipron as well as other drugs like SGLT2s. Yes. Well, first of all, it's an unfair comparison. We have so much data now on the benefits of GIP agonism from tens of thousands of participants in randomized clinical trials for Tirzepatide. So we're extremely confident here about the benefits of GIP agonism. Adding to that data, we have experimented with a pure GIP one agonist that doesn't have any GLP-1 and we reported the benefits there in our Phase I study. We're contrasting that here to a small Phase I study that was recently published with a drug that has both GLP-1 agonism and GIP antagonism. I noted in that publication, the GIP antagonism is at a much lower affinity. So it probably only starts to antagonize GIP at very high doses. It's probably a question for that company. But I noted at the high doses actually an increase in free fatty acids and complete attenuation of the decrease in triglycerides in the clinical trial. Those are some effects that we attribute to GIP.  And so I'm not surprised that antagonism of GIP is starting to have some negative effects once that kicks in. We also see GIP agonism as having positive benefits on tolerability, reducing potentially nausea and vomiting. Then again, I think maybe at the higher doses, you could probably see some hints of the opposite effect with antagonism. So pretty glad with the decision we took, and let's see how the field continues to evolve. I'll start with the second, and then maybe Patrik will weigh in on potential value here although that could be a good question for Amgen. Look, I think the sustainability data I saw in that publication are a bit underwhelming. It's a very high-dose drug at half-life of an antibody. So just based on plasma concentrations, that would be extended to -- expected to remain there after a month or two. It doesn't surprise me, but what we're seeing is that at doses that are reasonably well tolerated, if there were any doses that are reasonably well tolerated, weight loss is lower than what we would need to see to take a molecule to Phase III for sure. And sustainability doesn't appear to be at all differentiated."

            "content": "All right, thanks, Joe. 2023 was a year of advancement across our company. We grew our top-line. We progressed our pipeline. It advanced our external innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We continue to invest in quality, the reliability and the resilience of our company's manufacturing infrastructure, and most importantly, delivered new life-saving and life-changing medicines to more patients. In 2023, revenue grew 20% for the full year and 28% for the most recent quarter, as our newly launched portfolio continued to gain momentum. This past year, we announced positive Phase IIIs for Donanemab, Tirzepatide, Mirikizumab And Pertibrutinib. We also announced a positive Phase II result for Orforglipron as well as Retatrutide and moved these two important molecules into Phase III. In terms of external innovation, in 2023, we continued to complement our pipeline through acquisitions and collaborations. These transactions included the acquisition of DICE Therapeutics, POINT Biopharma, Versanis Bio, Emergence Therapeutics, Mablink Biosciences, Immunotrac as well as Sigilon Therapeutics. We have several significant investments in manufacturing, including plans to expand capacity at the company's Research Triangle Park facility and the two manufacturing sites within the LEAP Innovation Park in Boone County, Indiana. Most recently, we announced plans to construct a new high-tech manufacturing site in Germany. This facility will further expand the company's global injectable product and device manufacturing network, including for our diabetes and obesity portfolio. Most importantly, this past year, we brought innovative new medicines to patients. In 2023, we received regulatory approvals for Zepbound, Jaypirca, Omvoh, in the U.S. -- in the EU rather, and an expanded label for Verzenio and two new indications for Jardiance. This progress will serve as a foundation to drive top-tier revenue growth and margin expansion over time. As you can see on Slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables in Q4. Revenue grew 28% with our new products growing by over $2 billion. Since our last earnings call, we achieved several key pipeline milestones in addition to the Zepbound and Jaypirca CLL approvals, today, we announced top line results for the Tirzepatide Phase II SYNERGY-NASH trial as well as the Verzenio Phase III CYCLONE two trial. Dan will talk more about this update -- in his update. In terms of business development, in Q4, we completed the acquisitions of Mablink Bioscience and POINT Biopharma, the latter of which expands our capacity and capability into Radioligand therapies. Lastly, we announced a 15% dividend increase for the sixth consecutive year and distributed over $1 billion in dividends in the fourth quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q3 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical, and other updates. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q4 results. Thanks, Dan, and congrats to you and the team for a big year. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the fourth quarter. Q4 revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum. We achieved meaningful advances in our late-stage pipeline with the FDA approvals of Zepbound and Jaypirca. We continue to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late-stage medicines, early phase capabilities and in business development, all of which will serve as a foundation for future growth. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of POINT Biopharma and announced plans to build a new manufacturing site in Germany. We returned over $1 billion to shareholders via dividend. Lastly, in January, we announced that Jana Norton, our Executive Vice President of Global Quality, will be retiring at the end of July after 34 years of service. During her tenure, Jana has overseen significant expansion, modernization and improvements in our quality and manufacturing processes. I'd like to thank her for her many years of outstanding service to Lilly. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate our Q&A session. Yes, happy to answer that. Of course, as we enter this phase of really strong growth in the Incretins, we're very focused on allocating capital, but top priority is creating new capacities. The gating factors are not really financial for us right now, so you can expect us to be investing fully. We're not slowing down because of cash flow or whatever. It's really a function of the technical capacities, both in people and in suppliers to be able to bring facilities online. That's particularly true in the parenteral side. Now you're referencing Orforglipron. Here, we do plan to build ahead of Phase III at risk. I think, given the probability we assess internally as well as the opportunity on the other side of a positive Phase III, we see that as a wise investment. And as we've commented on before, it relies, as you would know, on very different assets inside Lilly as well as outside of Lilly. So here you have organic chemistry, API and tablets and capsules, so a pretty different setup. So we can -- we're paralleling that with our robust injectable investments. And if we're wrong, okay, we'll have to eat that in the end for isn't a strong product. But if it is, I think it does begin to change the math on supply in this category, and I think that's about worth taking. For that I can start, Patrik, jump in. Yes, thanks for the question. The idea was really actually borne out of the challenges patients face every day in the U.S. and sometimes seeing doctors. And you'll know we have a Doctor Finder tool as well as telehealth partners on the platform for migraine, diabetes, and obesity. Finding medicines and their pharmacies, that's been a challenge. And I think particularly as supplies are tight, many patients report driving to 5, 6, seven pharmacies to find the medicine they need that simplifies that process. And then I think in addition, there's been a lot of noise about drugs that are illicit or copies or compounded versions of Zepbound or other weight loss drugs and that's concerning to us. And I think it's concerning to patients. So by going to Lilly Direct literally, they have confidence in the supply. And finally, application of our savings programs has also been a challenge at the pharmacy counter and that happens 100% of the time on Lilly Direct. We haven't thought about it as a way to create some new retail distribution business. It's a way to serve the patients that want our medicines better. That's sort of the frame we're in now. Early days. We're trying to develop it to be smoother, better, include more products over time, have better information about physicians and telehealth providers. So look for more developments there, but good start so far. A lot of energy and enthusiasm from the patient community. I would frame like why I said that, but maybe Specific DDI question in the SGLT2 coadministration. I just said that because we're just starting the Phase III. And we all know small molecule, there's a bit of empiricism in terms of eliminating safety risk. And of course, every day, as we expose more patients to the drug and we have higher doses, that's a good day where we don't announce that the drug has a problem. At some point, we reached a lot of confidence. We just weren't at that point. We're not at it now. I think we're running the Phase III experiment and we need to discharge the off-target safety that is inherent in small molecule discovery, and we've seen in this class from others. But nothing specific on my mind. Maybe Dan can further reassure us. Yes, maybe I'll give it a shot. Thanks for the question, James. As I mentioned on the earlier question related to Orforglipron, we are not -- we don't think of ourselves as capital-constrained, buying or building in the space. The reality is there just isn't built capacity that's available. Most of it that's being used is already deployed against the leading products in the GLP-1 space, at least any at scale and new capacity has a lead time of three to four years. So all of the things that are coming online now, like we mentioned today, are very large site in Concord, North Carolina. That's a big node of capacity for the sector and certainly for Lilly. I mean, that was announced two and a half years ago and it will just begin production at the end of this year. So that's the problem. And why is that? Well, of course, greenfield building is difficult, repurposing is difficult, but also these are technically complex facilities. There's not an infinite number of people who know how to set them up. And the supply chain for the machines that make the products is also constrained. So at this point, I don't think there's an easy way forward. And I think even in yesterday's announcements, we have a lot of questions about that. But I think even the purchaser or our competitors said it will take many years for them to be able to increase capacity within that purchase. So it's just not an easy problem to solve. I think that over time, it will ease. There'll be more capacity brought online by us, our competitor and maybe others, including third parties and new technology will emerge like Orforglipron or other oral options, that tap into a different asset base. So I know it's frustrating for investors, it's frustrating for us. It's even more frustrating for patients but it's just sort of the situation we're in is that we steady gains in manufacturing over the coming several years and perhaps bigger gains after that."

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. As we stated, we are pleased we are so early in launch with the 35% commercial access, having contract a and Our efforts moving forward will really be to continue to expand payer access but not only we will do that with a very disciplined approach as we did with Mounjaro but also to make sure that we get to employer opt-in. And as Anat alluded to in her prepared remarks, that's going to take some time. But we are assuming that with the current access we have, that our access will be along the lines of what the competition has referred to, around 50%. Let me just emphasize that when it comes to employer opt-in, there is not one reliable source for employer opt-in. So I think that's something that we need to continue to monitor and we'll come back with more data during coming earnings calls. So overall, a good start and we will continue our efforts to increase payer access. I think we are quite encouraged with what we have heard from the marketplace so far. Employer opt-in will take longer, but we believe that we are well positioned in that regard as well. Thank you very much. I think there are two important aspects. The first one is when we refer to employer opt-in. I think employees are really looking actively into benefits of listing anti-obesity medications. And whatever data we can generate here being in the cardiovascular space, being in of being national average indications will be extremely important for increased employer opt-in. The second piece will be in Medicare Part D. As long as is not passed, I think data in those comorbidities will be critical to enable access for patients in Medicare Part D. So those are truly the key drivers for those indications. Thank you very much. When we look at the opportunity in obesity, we have more than 110 million in the U.S. and 650 million globally. I think taking into account the current supply constraints across markets, it's impossible to reach all of those with injectables. So I think that's the big opportunity we have for orforglipron. And what we have seen so far in Phase II, if we can replicate those data in Phase III, we have an oral medicine here with a weight loss along the lines of the best competitive Incretin, not at the level of Tirzepatide, but that's the level of the best Incretin in the marketplace and with no food or water restrictions. So we really see the opportunity here with orforglipron to reach patients across the globe. And there is another component as well. If we look at the current market, approximately 20% of patients with obesity are actually concerned to take an injectable. So that's another opportunity with orforglipron. So we believe that's a really strong drug in our hands moving forward in the space of chronic weight management. Yes. Thank you very much, Chris. I think you're right. It's quite challenging. It's still early days with both Mounjaro in particular Zepbound, and we have been facing some specific dynamics in terms of supply and also changes to the co-pay program. However, when we look at the recent data for Mounjaro, it's encouraging and it suggests that patients that start therapy back in Q1 2023 are having a persistency at least along the lines of other injectable Incretins. For Zepbound, definitely too early. But we strongly believe that patients will be motivated when they see the benefits of the drug. And there will, of course, be many factors impacting both supply, macroeconomic and microeconomic, but we are convinced that there will be a final duration of treatment also for obesity since when we look into even [indiscernible] in Type 2 diabetes, more than a 12-month period of adherence is considered long. But encouraging data in Type 2 diabetes so far. And with Zepbound, we will see, that will for sure be an end of duration based upon what we have seen in other chronic diseases, but we believe that the features itself will be motivating for patients. I think the only addition would be that we are always aiming for open access. We believe that's important for the providers and the patients we are serving. So that's going to be our aim when it comes to employer opt-in as well. And we believe a move by pricing set down 22% below the competition, despite launching with a best-in-class profile, is also a good signal for increased and enhanced employer opt-in. Only addition would be that when we look at the market research, of course, convenience is one factor, but it's not necessarily the most important factor when it comes to provider and consumer selecting treatment. So I'm really excited about the we have in our hands. Of course, Tirzepatide remaining a foundational treatment for obesity, but also with the addition of orforglipron and also the opportunities here to look into options with additional non-weight loss-dependent pharmacology to complement the assets we have in the pipeline."

            "content": "Thanks, Terence. As we think about Mounjaro launches outside the U.S., we have already launched in a number of select markets. We have foundation to be competitive in many of our markets, and we anticipate continued launches. We've just launched in vial format in select markets outside of the U.S., mainly in Australia, Canada and Germany, and Poland. And we just received QuickPen approval in the U.K., and so we're anticipating launch there. As we get additional regulatory approvals for a multi-use QuickPen and we monitor our ramp-up in capacity for supply, we'll continue to launch in other markets throughout the year. And so we anticipate further growth, anticipated four launches of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. and continue with that throughout the year as well as into 2025. Sure, yes. So the broader Tirzepatide outside of the U.S., it depends on a number of different factors, whether it's regulatory or competitive market dynamics. There are some payer dynamics as well. We don't anticipate that being a challenge in terms of negotiating reimbursement either for Type 2 diabetes or for management. We continue to have those discussions in a number of markets and are optimistic about our ability to commercialize under different brand scenarios."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Good morning. Thanks everybody for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes and obesity; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Joe. In Q3 Lily continued the progress we made so far this year. We delivered strong financial results continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invested in our future through several business development transactions.  As you can see on slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 24%. Our new products and growth products combined contributed approximately 17 percentage points toward volume growth, with over 12 percentage points coming from our growth products.  Last week, we announced that the FDA approved Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This marks Lilly's first approval in the U.S. for a type of inflammatory bowel disease. And it's important for Lilly's growth in its immunology portfolio. In addition to the FDA approval for Omvoh, we had several other important pipeline updates since our last earnings call.  Specifically Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, at risk of progression. And we reported positive Phase 3 results from the VIVID-1 trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  In Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for lebrikizumab based on inspection findings at a third party manufacturer. The letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, the safety or the label. We will continue to work with the third party manufacturer and the FDA to address the findings to make lebrikizumab available to patients as quickly as possible.  In terms of business development, we once again had a very active quarter. In Q3, we completed the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, which will further enable us to focus on our current and new product launches. The financial impact of this transaction is reflected in the Q3 results. Additionally, within the quarter, we completed the acquisition of two clinical stage companies, adding to our Phase 2 portfolio, DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio as well as the acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics and Sigilon Therapeutics. We also announced that we reached an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma, which, if approved, has the potential to expand our oncology capabilities into next generation radioligand therapies. And lastly, we distributed over a $1 billion in dividends this quarter.  On slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 call, including several important regulatory clinical and other updates we're sharing today.  Now let me turn the call over Anat to review our Q3 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi : Thanks Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.  We're pleased with the strong financial performance this quarter, highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, representing robust momentum in our core business. Q3 revenue increased 37% versus Q3 2022. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and from the COVID-19 antibodies, revenue increased 24% in Q3. This represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration of revenue growth, driven by Mounjaro and the continued strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.7%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, the absence of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q3 2023, and higher realized prices partially offset by increases in manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with new product launches and additional indications, as well as compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 34%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late stage assets and additional investments in early stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $2.98 billion, which negatively impacted EPS by $3.29. In Q3, 2022, acquired IP R&D charges totaled $62 million, or $0.06 of EPS. Operating income decreased 71% in Q3, driven by acquired IP R&D charges, partially offset by higher revenue associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio.  Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 6% for the quarter, and reflected a negative impact of approximately 31 percentage point attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our q3 effective tax rate was 84.6%. This represents an increase of approximately 74 percentage points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IP R&D charges incurred this quarter.  Other than the impact of acquired IP R&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously providing guidance. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.10 in Q3, a 95% decrease versus Q3 2022, inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and a negative impact of $3.29 from the acquired IP R&D charges.  On slide 8, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter U.S. revenue increased 21%. When excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 32% driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 13% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro, access and savings cards dynamics.  Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected Mounjaro access and saving card dynamics to have a meaningful impact on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of 2023, which was evident in Q3. Europe continued to post robust growth against this again this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine divestiture, revenue was up 7% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 11% primarily from Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased 16% in constant currency. Excluding Mounjaro, which had a one time upfront payment associated with the sales collaboration agreement in the base period, revenue in Japan decreased 3% in constant currency, driven primarily by customer buying patterns related to [indiscernible]. Moving to China revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth of 25% partially offset by price decline. Volume growth in Q3 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We're encouraged by the growth we have seen this year in China.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 23% in constant currency, as volume growth of 28% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see the new product and growth product categories combined, contributed approximately 17 percentage points of rolling growth for the quarter. The absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a headwind of nearly six percentage points to volume in Q3. This headwind will abate as COVID-19 antibody sales were minimal after the third quarter of 2022.  Lastly, revenue from the sales of rights to the olanzapine portfolio delivered nearly 22 percentage points of growth this quarter.  Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 68% in Q3, driven by robust volume growth. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. As you heard earlier in Q3 Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.  In Q3 we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline 10% as volume growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower prices driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals, now [ph] to start new patients on Trulicity.  Moving to slide 11, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of Mounjaro, as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro revenue grew to just over $1.4 billion globally this quarter, up from $980 million the previous quarter. In Q3, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro. As of October 1 access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. reached 78% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 85% access for commercial patients. This expanded access gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes.  As communicated last quarter, since the $25 non-covered copay card program expires on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. As a reminder we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 non-covered copay card, but inclusive of the $25 covered copay card. We expect Mounjaro net price will continue to benefit from the higher percentage of paid prescription, but will also continue to face a headwind for more rebated volume as access improves.  Looking forward to the end of the year with increased access we expect to continue to see overall growth in prescription trends. In terms of Mounjaro supply, we're continuing to make progress in our manufacturing expansion agenda. Given strong demand, we continue to experience tight supply throughout most of Q3, which impacted results for the quarter. Most recently U.S. product shipments have increased and inventory levels at U.S. wholesalers have improved with all doses of Mounjaro now listed as available on the FDA shortage website.  While supply constraints have eased in the U.S., outside the U.S. Trulicity and -- outside the U.S. to Trulicity and Mounjaro supply remains tight, which materially impacted performance in these regions. With device assembly online at RTP, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling capacity by the end of this year from where we were a year ago, and are gradually increasing production each quarter.  We're also continuing to focus on other parts of the supply chain, as demand is expected to remain high and production bottlenecks may shift over time. As we mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentation of Mounjaro to reach more patients around the world faster. We have launched with a single dose vial in Australia, and plan to launch in other markets outside the U.S. in the coming weeks and months.  The introduction of a single dose vial presentation in these geographies is intended to serve as a bridge to a multi-dose quick pen, which we expect will be available starting in 2024. We're also preparing for potential launch of tirzepatide for obesity in the U.S. this year. Our auto injector capacity and output continues to increase. And we look forward to bring tirzepatide to more patients in the months and years ahead.  On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested nearly $12 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we've returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 13 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Guidance for the first four line items including revenue, gross margin percent, marketing and selling and administrative expenses and R&D expense is unchanged. I would note that we are trending towards the higher end of our estimates for gross margin and the top end of our ranges for operating expense categories. You'll see that we've updated guidance for acquired IP R&D charges, OID, tax rate EPS, to reflect the inclusion of IP R&D charges for completed transactions through Q3, and year-to-date results on equity investments and GAAP guidance. These updates do not include the effect of potential charges associated with pending or future business development transactions after Q3. We will provide our initial 2024 guidance when we report Q4 results.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks Anat. This quarter, we had significant pipeline progress as well as a high volume of activity at the major medical congresses, where we presented new data on multiple products across all of our therapeutic areas.  Starting with oncology, since our last earnings call, we announced top line results from the LIBRETTO-531 study evaluating Retevmo versus physicians' choice of multi kinase inhibitors as an initial treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer. As we presented at ESMO the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 72% improvement in progression-free survival compared to Cabozantinib or Vandetanib. These data should establish Retevmo as the standard of care for the initial systemic treatment of patients with progressive advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and we have work to do to ensure that all of these patients are identified and properly diagnosed.  We also shared detailed data from the Phase 3 LIBRETTO-431 study at ESMO in October, showing that Retevmo more than doubled progression free survival compared to chemotherapy plus Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer. We hope these data in addition to others recently published, for other driver positive lung cancers will help accelerate genomic profiling at lung cancer diagnosis to guide initial treatment selection.  The results of LIBRETTO-531 and of LIBRETTO-431 were each simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also at ESMO we should landmark five year results from a pre-planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 monarchE study, evaluating Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy, compared to endocrine therapy alone, in patients with HR positive HER2 negative no positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. The impact of two years of Verzenio treatment is observed well beyond the treatment period, reducing the risk of long term recurrence by 32% at five years.  These data reinforced two years of Verzenio plus endocrine therapy as the standard of care for high risk early breast cancer patients. Lastly, we shared data on imlunestrant, our oral SERD being studied in Phase 3 as a single agent and in combination therapy. The data shared included the first clinical data for imlunestrant in combination with everolimus or alpelisib as well as updated monotherapy from the Phase 1 EMBER study in patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.  We hope that imlunestrant could be an important future endocrine therapy backbone, in certain settings of breast cancer. And these new data show that the medicine can be safely combined with other agents utilized with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.  Looking earlier in oncology pipeline, we shared preclinical data on three of our new pipeline agents at the triple meeting on molecular targets in cancer therapeutics in October. We shared preclinical data for first, a highly potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D, that is selective against wild type KRAS. Second, a highly potent and isoform selective pan-KRAS inhibitor, with activity against a broad spectrum of the most common activating KRAS mutations, and high selectivity of a wild type H RES and N RES. And third, a fully human monoclonal anti-Nectin-4 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  These programs are among the next slate of oncology agents we expect to enter the clinic over the next year. They represent years of focused work to create potentially differentiated molecules against exacting target product profiles.  Turning to our diabetes and obesity portfolio, in Q3, we announced the FDA approval of Jardiance for treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase 3 trial Jardiance significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular deaths in adults with CKD. This approval adds to the treatment options for the more than 35 million adults in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease.  Since our last earnings call, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial at the obesity weight conference in October, with the results simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Also in October, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-4 study at EASD. These results will be subsequently published in a top tier peer reviewed medical journal.  Data from these Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide showed that participants achieved up to 26.6% total mean weight loss. The detailed results from these studies clearly show the importance of continued therapy for sustained weight management, and that if approved, tirzepatide could be an important part of obesity management, for those having difficulty maintaining weight loss with diet and exercise alone.  Our pipeline, as shown on slide 14, now includes a high dose tirzepatide NILEX in Phase 2, since we have initiated a study exploring higher doses of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Earlier in the pipeline, we presented Phase 1 data on Muvalaplin at the European Society of Cardiology Congress with simultaneous publication in JAMA [ph]. Muvalaplin is the first oral agent specifically developed to lower Lp(a) levels. In this Phase 1 study Muvalaplin was well tolerated by participants and resulted in dose dependent lowering of Lp(a) of up to 65%. Muvalaplin is currently in Phase 2.  As shown on slide 14, we've advanced our SCAP siRNA into Phase 1 for NASH. We've also completed our acquisition of Versanis and NASH Bimagrumab [ph] in Phase 2. We are excited about the potential combination of Bimagrumab and tirzepatide.  Lastly, we're happy to share that since our last earnings call the Retatrutide TRIUMPH Phase 3 core registration trials are now all actively enrolling to pursue simultaneous indications for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis.  Turning to our neuroscience portfolio, the FDA has shared with us that the Donanemab review will extend into Q1 2024 needing additional time to complete their review. We've completed submissions in Europe and Japan, and submissions to other global regulatory authorities are either completed or underway. Recently, at the clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting, we presented new insights from donanemab development program during a symposium session.  As part of this symposium, we shared ARIA data from a pooled analysis that included more than 2000 participants dosed with donanemab, and explored ARIA E association across a number of baseline variables, highlighting a few key factors most strongly associated with ARIA risk, including baseline amyloid levels, evidence of a prior bleed and high blood pressure. Interestingly, this data also suggested use of antihypertensives decreased the risk of ARIA.  Additionally, we shared analyses from our open label addendum of over 1,000 patients treated with donanemab. These results included a post hoc analysis of patients with no brain tau, and demonstrated similar or even stronger biomarker results than our main TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. In a separate post hoc analysis from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 study, related to activities of daily living and independence, in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease we showed that compared to placebo, people treated with donanemab preserved more of their ability to perform many of the items measured, including their ability to make meals, to use appliances, keep appointments, perform pastimes, and be safely left unattended.  We also shared an update on our validation data for our Plasma P tau 217 test for identifying amyloid positive patients demonstrating robust performance of this immunoassay. We expect to have this test commercially available in a phased approach first, as a laboratory developed test by the end of this year.  As you recall, we use Plasma P tau 207 to identify pre symptomatic individuals for our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial. This is an event driven trial and we have now recruited a sufficient number of qualifying pre-symptomatic participants and expect to have efficacy results within three years. We're excited to announce today that our Otoferlin Gene therapy asset from Akouos has begun dosing patients in a Phase 1/2 trial for hearing loss.  In immunology, as Dave noted, we're happy to have FDA approval for Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This approval offers new hope for patients, who are searching for an effective option that can offer rapid and lasting improvements. Omvoh will be approved --available to patients in the U.S. in the coming weeks. We were also excited to have the Phase 3 readout for this molecule, mirikizumab in Crohn's disease. In the VIVID 1 Phase 3 study mirikizumab met the co-primary in all major secondary endpoints compared to placebo. Mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response for patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease through 52 weeks. We were thrilled to see that more than half of participants on mirikizumab achieved clinical remission at one year, and that robust efficacy was seen in both participants who are naive to biologic therapy, as well as participants who previously failed a prior biologic therapy.  Helping patients achieve long term clinical remission is a key goal for us in our pursuit of treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. These new data in Crohn's Disease build on the high levels of long term remission seen with mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis, and help reinforce the differentiation of this important potential medicine. This successful Phase 3 trial will be the basis of global regulatory submissions for Crohn's Disease.  As Dave noted earlier in Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab, based on findings at a third party manufacturer. In Q3 we completed the acquisition of DICE and now reflect the two oral IL-17 assets, DICE 853 and DICE 806 in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our pipeline respectively. Additionally, two new molecules began Phase 2 studies in immunology this quarter. First, our CD200R monoclonal antibody, known as Ucenprubart for atopic dermatitis, and second, our RIPK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis.  We've removed our BTLA monoclonal antibody agonist from Phase 2 in our pipeline, after the Phase 2a study failed to demonstrate efficacy. Q3 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly.  I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks: Thank you, Dan. Before we get to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the third quarter. This quarter revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum, of course led by Mounjaro. Excluding revenue from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and the sale of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue grew 24%, driven again by Mounjaro, Verzenio as well as Jardiance.  By continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late stage medicines and early phase capabilities as well as in business development, we are confident that we have positioned ourselves for growth now and in the coming years, with the opportunity for continued margin expansion. We achieved meaningful advances in our late stage pipeline, with the FDA approval of Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well as Jardiance for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, and the positive Phase 3 VIVID 1 results for mirikizumab for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  Looking forward, we are expecting regulatory responses before the end of the year on our submissions for pirtobrutinib, and accelerated approval in CLL as well as tirzepatide for obesity. In Q3, we completed several targeted acquisitions, intended to bolster our early and mid stage portfolio. Directly following the quarter we also announced an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma which will further expand our R&D capabilities in oncology.  Lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. A few weeks ago, we announced several leadership changes. Mike Mason, our Executive Vice President and President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity will retire from the company at the end of 2023 after 34 years with Lilly. In his current role, Mike is overseeing tirzepatide, late stage development and an unprecedented type 2 diabetes launch. Mike leaves behind an enduring legacy that reflects his deep compassion for patients and his commitment to our people. With this being Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him for his many years of outstanding service to Lily and wish him all the best in his next chapter of life.  Patrick Johnson will assume leadership of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity. In addition to his current responsibilities as President of Lilly USA Dan Skovronsk, our Chief Scientific Officer and president of Lilly Research Labs will take on the additional role of President of Lilly Immunology from Patrick. And in a related move, David Hyman is assuming the role of Chief Medical Officer for the company from Dan, overseeing the full Lilly portfolio. Leigh Ann Pusey, our Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications has decided to leave the company at the end of 2023. Leigh Ann has left a lasting impact on Lilly and the patients we serve. And we're grateful for her many contributions over the past six years.  So as we begin this new chapter of growth for our company, we are very confident that our deep experience of our leadership team will allow us to continue to accelerate our efforts to make medicines and be more effective and more innovative in the years ahead.  So now, let me turn the call over to Joe and he'll moderate the Q&A session. \nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. So consistent with last quarter we will respond to one question per caller. So ask that you limit to one question per caller. As we'll aim to end the call at 10 am. If you have more than one question you can reenter the queue, and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live?\nTimothy Anderson: Thank you so much. I have a question on obesity and persistence on therapy, which I think has been a big question mark. I know you haven't formally launched yet, but guessing you might have some idea, a best guess if nothing else. So in your view is this going to be like most other drug categories where persistence on therapy is often low? I think the rule of thumb is that at the one year mark 50% of patients drop off chronic medicines.  So really, the question is, if you took 100 patients who start on one of these contemporary obesity drugs, how many of that initial 100 would likely still be on therapy, let's say three or four or five years down the road.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim. Mike, you would you like to weigh in on the persistence of therapy on obesity? \nMichael Mason: Yeah, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll first answer with the data that we do have, because it's hard to speculate on what it's going to be for obesity. The best data we have for tirzepatide is in Type 2 diabetes patients who started Mounjaro prior to our savings card changes last fall Mounjaro persistency for those patients is tracking higher than those patients that were started on trulicity and Ozempic, over that same period of time.  So while it's too early to project the average length of therapy or how many out of 100 will still be on therapy after a couple of years, I think that this early data is encouraging. As for obesity, time was time was going to tell. I think we've all looked at Wegovy data, but I don't think this is the right benchmark at this point because of novel supply constraints. And there's been just a very dynamic market. I think, as you said, this -- having persistency on a chronic treatment isn't just an issue for anti-obesity medications. It's a goal for all chronic treatments.  I think what's different about obesity is that, on many chronic treatments, consumers don't feel differently or experience any acute impacts from stopping treatments. So what we've seen in this SURMOUNT clinical trials, with tirzepatide is that some consumers will feel their appetite increase and experience weight regain when they stopped tirzepatide. And so this should help reinforce treatment adherence, seeing in our market research how important it is for people who live with obesity to lose weight and maintain it.  I do think you're going to see just a high motivation as people have lost weight that they do want to maintain it. And we do know for our SURMOUNT program that, chronic use of tirzepatide is a good component, an important component of maintaining weight loss. So it's too early to project it. But I do think there's things that's rolling in favor of tirzepatide having a good length of therapy in the obesity patient.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Next question, Paul.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks so much for the question. So I really wanted to drill into orforglipron, and those Phase 3 programs. Dan, I was just hoping that you could clarify for the market, if there's any monitoring in that study related to liver enzyme elevations. I think there was one case in the Phase 2 diabetes study that you conducted. Just wanted to know if there's any related concerns associated with that. Or if this is kind of as expected, an all hands on deck moving forward opportunity. Thanks.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Seamus. Yeah, I like the way you phrase it all hands on deck moving forward on orforglipron. We're really excited about this molecule. In terms of, liver safety, I think we commented before that, what we saw in Phase 2 is what we thought would be probably be typical for a trial of that nature in this population.  So not a heightened level of concern, but always concerned about safety going into Phase 3 from a variety of factors, including for all small molecules, especially liver function. So it's routine in our Phase 3 studies across the portfolio to monitor liver function. And sure we're doing that in orforglipron, but not aware of any special precautions there. So super excited that that program is going fast.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terrence, your line is live.\nTerence Flynn: Great, thanks so much for taking the questions. Anat you had mentioned shifting the date of your 2024 guidance call early next year. Just want to know what drove that change? And if you can assure us that there are no issues with tirzepatide OBC review and/or manufacturing? Thank you.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Sure. So let me first start with reassuring you that there are no issues behind our decision to move the guidance date to -- or have it aligned with our Q4 earnings call. What it does do is it does help us have the yearend full results when we provide guidance for 2024. So previously, if we didn't have that, investors had to look at guidance range for the year and estimates based on midpoint, etc. This does enable us to close the year and then have a full view into 2024. It is aligned with our internal planning processes as well. And obviously is the way most companies and I believe all companies in our industry do that.  So nothing unique going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023, going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you Anat. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit your line is live.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. And my question is regarding the P documents [ph], seven biomarker data you have shown at CTAD. It seems like the predictability is getting to 94% of these tests, even C2N was pretty good. So do you have any thoughts on at this point, how close are we to actually make this -- bring this to prime time? And when the donanemab gets approved do you think this could be the test doctors use? Or it will still take some time to get to that?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Mohit, for the question. You broke up a little bit there. But I think we got the gist. I'll hand off to Anne.\nAnne White: Yes. So we shared at CTAD, we were pleased with the data that we saw. And we're also pleased to see progress across the field in blood biomarkers. We definitely believe that this is incredibly important to drive access and early diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease. So you've seen us invest in a number of fronts, our own p tau 217, but also partnering with others who are working on good tests to elevate the area. So it's a strategy of raising all boats.  But yes, we did share our data. And we intend to make this available in a phased approach commercially as an LDT starting at the end of this year, in a couple of sites, and then continuing to expand over 2024. But at the same time, you'll see us continue to publish the data. We think that what's incredibly important in the field, is that good correlative data, particularly with amyloid PET, which is the gold standard in diagnosis is published and shared so that we can continue to make sure that we have high quality tests out there.  So that's part of our goal with delivering this test is to really set a standard for what blood tests should look like. So look forward to hearing more over the next coming months as we publish that data and then make that more broadly available.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Anne, and thanks Mohit for the question, Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor, Louise your line is live. \nLouise Chen: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask you, do you think the approval of additional oral potential -- approval of additional oral diabetes drug could impact the pricing for injectables? Why or why not? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Louise, for the question. I'll hand over to Mike about the potential approval for other oral diabetes drugs and potential impact on injectables?\nMichael Mason: No, I don't think that'll have an impact. I mean, traditionally, we don't see a new class of diabetes agents coming in and affecting a current class. Usually the competition happens within a specific class within a diabetes market.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. Jeff, your line is live. \nGeoff Meacham: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Just had one on tirzepatide supply. I know you guys have, a plant in North Carolina and another one coming online next year. But if you look beyond that, if you have demand anywhere near what's modeled, and even outside of obesity and diabetes, obviously, supply could remain tight. So the question is, is there a threshold of treated patients like in the near term that will inform your decision on adding manufacturing capacity? And how much does the outlook for or orforglipron have on that? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Geoff for the question. I'll hand over to Dave. \nDavid Ricks: Yeah, thanks, Geoff. Obviously a hot topic. We work on this multiple hours every day. You're citing the announcements we've made and as mentioned great progress is showing manufacturing agenda RTP sort of on track to deliver on its goal. But as we exit the year, and then that kind of in market volume following that Concord, which is a few hours away, and kind of a replica site also, well on track for coming online in '24. So that's good news in the ERMA [ph] presentation, which is -- what we call our auto injector, from trulicity, and the current presentation from Mounjaro in the U.S. We've announced previously that we're introducing now single use vial presentation ex-U.S., so that we aren't basically sitting on approvals and connect patients have access to the medication.  That will follow them by a multi use injector that uses different property, plant and equipment than what we're talking about here. So a couple of things to point out. You're noting kind of new greenfield site expansions. We've rightfully made a big deal out of. We're not done with those. I think you might hear more about that in the future. Of course, we are aggressively planning that and not banking on or forced upon to rescue us from this. We think that there is a need to take up parenteral incretin supply pretty dramatically from the current levels. And we plan to do that.  But that will be in a combination of the current syringe-based auto injector, the vial capacity, we've already talked about. The multi use injector, which will come online sometime next year, and is a highly efficient play for us because it uses current systems and different ones from the auto injector. And then there's third party agreements that have been ongoing in the background. And to point out here, we are not relying on one. We have a diverse portfolio of third parties, recognizing that, the probability of full supply from any one is probably less than one. But buying up as much capacity as available in all those systems.  So we've got a, I think the all hands on deck phrase was used earlier. I mean, this is really all hands on deck. And it's a problem we work every day. So we're not at all happy with the capacity. We've announced already, you'll see more. Some we don't announce that we'll just layer in to the volume we ship. And of course, long term new presentations like solid oral opens up even more possibilities, but we need to do everything we can now given the huge potential for global obesity treatment for our medicines to play a key role in that, and then ultimately impact hundreds of millions of people.  So a lot of work to do here yet ahead. Thanks for the question.\nJoe Fletcher: Paul, next question?\nOperator: The next question is from Laura Hindley from Berenberg. Laura, your line is live.\nLaura Hindley : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So I think it's clear from your results that the next steps in Mounjaro is rapidly in progress. But how should we think about the ex-U.S. trulicity contribution going forward, which did look weak this quarter? But at the moment you're still supply restricted? Can we expect a return to growth into next year as constraints ease or should we now assume Trulicity is ex-growth as you push the shift into Mounjaro? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Laura for the question. I'll hand over to Ilya Ufa, President of Lilly International. Ilya, do you want to address Trulicity ex-U.S. contributions in the quarter and going forward?\nIlya Yuffa: Sure, first, thanks for the question. From a trulicity standpoint, we had healthy growth coming into later part of last year. And we've been pretty transparent with both physicians as well as regulators that due to the tight supply, we are encouraged not to start new patients. We continue with that, to be transparent. We think it's the right thing to do. And as we think about the growth in incretin, we're looking as we build up capacity, as David mentioned.  As we increase capacity both in the single use vial and introduce Mounjaro in additional markets as we have in Australia and we will continue over the next number of weeks and months in other markets and then transition towards a multi-use platform in quick time in introducing Mounjaro. And so the overall growth in incretin will be mainly driven by as we are able to launch Mounjaro in new markets that's probably will go get the growth. Thank you for the question.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks Ilya, Paul. Next question?\nOperator: The next question is coming from Umar Rafat from Evercore. Umar, your line is live.\nUmer Raffat: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I realize Mounjaro has not approved in obesity yet. But I'm just very curious how you're thinking about the pros and cons heading into that pricing decision, if there is any, because Novo does have that price premium, as you know, on Wegovy or Ozempic. So on the one hand, while Mounjaro price could be the same because the dose is the same, but on the other hand, Novo has this dynamic where it can offer a lot more rebate for the obesity indication than you can, if you leave the price unchanged. I'm just curious what your thought process is heading into that.\nJoe Fletcher: I'll hand over to Mike.\nMichael Mason: Yeah, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're not going to talk about price prior to approval. We're evaluating every scenario. We will make the right decision for patients who live with obesity. Thanks,\nJoe Fletcher: Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink. David, your line is live.\nDavid Risinger : Yes, thanks very much. And thanks for all the updates today. So some major payers seem to under appreciate the broad health savings potential that incretins offer the non-diabetic obese population, and instead focus on criticizing drug pricing. So ahead of the results from Mounjaro's morbidity and mortality outcomes trial in 2027, how does Lilly plan to better inform payers about Mounjaro's health economics benefits in non-diabetic obese patients? Thanks very much.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave for the question. Mike, do you want to talk a little bit about that, about the longer term appreciation for the broader health benefits of medicines, like tirzepatide?\nMichael Mason: Yeah, no, David, it's a good question. One that we've obviously spent a ton of time on and done a lot of internal analysis and a lot of planning on. We will have a whole suite of real world evidence and pragmatic trials so that we can answer this question clearly, for payers and other stakeholders. In our conversations with payers, while they're concerned about the short term budget impact, they do understand that losing weight will have benefits. It's not that hard of a sale, because they do understand the benefits are intuitive.  If you look at the total number of like obesity rate of complications, there's over 200. And you look at some of these are just really devastating and very costly, like type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia. And then when you look at the cost of these, on the U.S. alone, there's $370 billion in direct medical costs associated with obesity-related comorbidities, and over a trillion in indirect annual cost. When payers see that, people living with obesity and overweight, drive 2.7 times greater healthcare costs, than normal individuals, that data does get their attention.  And so I think over time will continue to provide health economics data, but also I think the voice of those living with obesity will be very important in this. This is a disease that, that really materially impacts someone's both health and mental functioning. And is really important for people who live with obesity. Their goal is to is to lose weight and maintain that so they can help their long term health benefits. And they're going to have a loud voice in this. I think both in commercial insurance as well as in states and the federal government. And so I do -- I am confident over time that we will see increase in access.  I think the most recent report shows that there's 50 million people in the U.S. that has access to obesity medication. So it will take time, but I think -- do think more and more payers are appreciating the value that anti-obesity medications especially when we get approval for tirzepatide will offer them. Thanks.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Mike. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, thank you so much for giving me the question and congrats on the progress. So given the executive changes announced in October, how should we think about the direction of the immunology business now with Dan at the helm? Thank you guys.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan. Dave, do you want to take that?\nDavid Ricks: Sure, I can start and let Dan comment. Look, we've been really pleased with this business, which I think is important to take the long view here. I mean, I was involved in creating this like 10 years ago, and both [indiscernible] and now mirikizumab, and hopefully soon Lebrikizumab will form a really core portfolio for us, really exploiting ideas that we had some time ago. What's next, and you see here today advancing another checkpoint agonist into Phase 2 is a lot of decisions about, okay, what's next to take immunology to the next level. And that's largely going to be about key decisions, both internal portfolio and potentially externally, like with our DICE acquisition, to find a new set of either single agent or combinations that can raise the standard of care in tough immunology diseases, noting, in particular in IBD and RA, the standard of care is hardly satisfied today.  We measure real pretty low performance status of success. So that's the mission that Dan and we've hired Mark Genovese to the company and others to really build a portfolio the future. So I don't Dan, if you want to\nDaniel Skovronsky: No, excited about the opportunity. There's lots of work to do in immunology, given the depth of unmet medical needs and the science is great here. So I hope we can continue to bring great drugs to market as we're doing with mirikizumab. And we hope to do with Lebrikizumab soon and more to come.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan, for the question. Next question, Paul.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your life is live. \nChristopher Schott : Great. Thanks so much. Just as we're thinking about the upcoming tirzepatide obesity approval, just interested in your perspective of how we should anticipate commercial coverage ramping, as we think of maybe the first couple of quarters post launch versus where it could be in a year or two from now, a business how quickly can we think about coverage coming on board? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Mike to comment on anticipation of commercial coverage over time, Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yeah, no, it's a good question. It will ramp up. We're trying to be disciplined. And we're trying to make sure that we bring on access as quickly, as is prudent. And so just like we did with Mounjaro we will take and make sure that we sometimes access has to materialize at an organic pace where it makes sense. And we'll make sure and use our judgment. So just like with Mounjaro, while we'd love to get out of the gate quickly, most importantly, as a setup for long term success. So you'll see a kind of a natural ramp up that you would with any new product. And I think it's important, as you look in the first quarter of our launch last January, when you saw Wegovy resupply. They were resupplying into a market where they already had capacity.  So I think when you look at our access, and you look at our volume as we head into next year, you'll see a ramp up in volume as you see a ramp up in our access.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve your line is live.\nStephen Scala: Oh, thank you very much. A question on why Lilly is evaluating higher doses of tirzepatide. There is risk and adverse event is uncovered and taints the franchise, and of course there are IRA considerations. Does this suggest some reservation about the pipeline either Triple G or orforglipron, the former, which has safety signals, the latter of which took five years to get to Phase 3. It would also be interesting to know whether it's the exact same molecule or it's been enhanced in some way. Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Steve for the question, Dan. \nDaniel Skovronsky:\norforglipron: So there's no hesitation or trepidation there at all. I think though notwithstanding those two molecules, which I expect to be great and important contributors to human health, we have, tirzepatide. I'm not exactly sure if we've maximized the dose response, if we hit the flat part of the dose response curve yet. It looks like we might be close. But we want to explore it. And so we're testing the higher doses in Phase 2. I think we've had enough patients on this drug for long enough that I expect the risk of uncovering a new safety signal with sort of marginally higher doses is extremely low. So not worried about that at all.\nJoe Fletcher: Let me just jump in here maybe on questions like this. And we have a number of research projects and obesity and related mechanisms. In some people ask, well how does this one affect that or whatever. That's not really the mindset in which we're pursuing this. We're -- we see ourselves a leader in the space and have a unique opportunity. And our goal is to exploit every single idea till we get data that says we shouldn't. And so high dose tirzepatide just another version of that. But it doesn't have a read through to other things. Were just in all the above mode in obesity. Thank you.  Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs, Chris, your line is live.\nChris Shibutani : Thank you. Good morning. In about a week or so we'll get detailed results from the SELECT cardiovascular outcomes trial, the American Heart meeting. Can you share with us what perhaps three key questions that the Lilly team will be looking at when we get detailed results?\nJoe Fletcher: Dan, do you want to weigh in on--?\nDaniel Skovronsky: I don't know. I can start maybe. Maybe Mike has some to add here. Look, I'm excited to see that data, of course, as everyone else's. But the top line looks good. For me, I think we're sort of creating now data points on a line that connect the level of weight loss with the degree of cardiovascular benefit. I think this point fits on that line reasonably well. That line which was greater health benefits, including better, a fewer mace outcomes with greater degrees of weight loss bodes very well for Mounjaro data, given the very high degrees of weight loss that we saw in our trials. I'll leave it at that. See if Mike wants to add.\nMichael Mason: Probably the key question I'm looking at is like how much of the effect was driven by drug effect versus weight loss is probably the key question we're looking at.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dan and Mike. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Carter Gould from Barclays. Carter, your line is live.\nCarter Gould : Great. Good morning. Congrats on the progress. May be following on, on the prior question, but maybe more on sort of the impact of the flow data, and your thoughts there. Specifically, you guys have taken sort of a different approach with your more recent assets there in terms of targeting that population. Is Lily's view that those benefits will accrue to the class and maybe just talk about how you think about targeting that segment down the road? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Carter for the question. Dan you want to comment on the flow data? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, so you're asking about kidney disease. I mean, I think the profound effect that incretin seem to be having on the kidneys is really a nice and important additive benefit here. This is something that's been observed with multiple class members now and they expect it will extend into our incretins as well. So it's exciting and I think proof that these drugs perhaps in addition to weight loss and A1C control, could have other direct metabolic benefits including the kidney.\nJoe Fletcher: Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung your line is live.\nTrung Huynh : Morning, all. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just one on Mounjaro U.S. pricing. So by our calculations, we think that 3Q '23 the net price is around 440 per TRX. For the rest of the year do you think that net price can continue to go up and above the saving card price of 450 [ph]. Although payers willing to pay for this, or is this broadly capped now until that saving card ends? And for next year, can you just give us your thoughts on if net price can meaningfully keep increasing? Thanks. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Trung. Mike, do you want to make any comments around Mounjaro pricing?\nMichael Mason: Yeah, no, I'd be happy to do that. I think maybe at a macro level, I would say that our gross to net for Mounjaro in Q3, that kind of normalized. Before then we had a number of saving card changes that that, made our gross to net rate dynamic. Our last and copay card change occurred late in Q2, so at the end of June. And so Q3 was a kind of a pure quarter, where we didn't have any other copay card changes. And I would say that our Mounjaro rate normalized at that point, you know, going forward, I think what you'll see is what you see normally for a product at this point in the lifecycle that as we pursue gaining access, there'll probably be some pricing pressure related to that. But we don't have any other coping card changes planned in the near future.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mike. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Robyn Karnauskas. From Truist Securities. Robyn, your line is live.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. This is Nicole [indiscernible] on for Robyn. Going back to obesity, how are you thinking through the impact on Mounjaro if Ira [ph] stays and Wegovy and Ozembic prices decline in the 2026-20 27 time frame?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Nicole for the question. I think it's very -- if I heard you right, you're thinking about IRA impacts to maybe semaglutide and potential impacts to Mounjaro. Mike, do you want to comment on that briefly?\nMichael Mason: Yeah, and I'll happy to do that, Obviously, it's too early to really impact how IRA will have an impact and the impact will have another product within the class. I think what you know, what's important for tirzepatide is it is the first dual acting incretin. And we do think it has a unique profile. And in head to head results in type 2 diabetes, it did show superior, both I1C and weight to semaglutide. And so at the end of the day, I think the profile of the product will carry the day. And obviously more to come on the IRA. As the first products go through the negotiation, we see the impact, but we're confident in the profile of tirzepatide.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you Mike. Paul, I think we have two calls left in the queue. Why don't we go through those two quickly, and then we'll wrap up?\nOperator: Certainly. The first one is a follow up from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live. \nSeamus Fernandez: Oh, great. Thanks for the follow up question. So just in terms of how you're thinking about the introduction of oral treatments, and the importance of pushing for what would be hopefully a maintenance type regimen. Is Lily looking at oral therapies as more of a maintenance regimen opportunity, or do you see a broader opportunity here, perhaps bringing in other mechanisms that perhaps could aid in pursuing, I guess, the ever elusive metabolic set point? Thanks. \nJoe Fletcher: Dan, do you want to comment on that?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yeah, thanks, Seamus. Maybe to paraphrase Dave's previous answers, it's sort of in all of the above here, I think there's great opportunities on the oral as a standalone therapy for initiation of therapy. Also, yes, for maintenance therapy globally. And also, yes, for potential combinations. You know, I point out the obvious fact that this is a GLP. One monotherapy. So we benchmark it against the best injectable GLP1 monotherapy. But I don't expect as an oral it will achieve the same levels of efficacy we can see with dual agonism like tirzepatide. So the future certainly will hold combinations like that. Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: And the last question, Paul from the queue.\nOperator: Certainly. The last question will be a follow up from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim, your line is live.\nTimothy Anderson: Thank you. What's the latest thinking on the topic of get agonism versus antagonism. Tirzepatide is the former Amgen drug is the latter. I've never seen two drugs in any category that have a similar clinical effect but opposing underlying activity the biologic target. Amgen says get antagonism is the way to go supported by their genetic analyses. What is Lily saying? Have you looked similarly at genetic analyses to inform your view? \nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Tim, for the last question, Dan.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yeah, I'll take that. I, of course, say we have now I think more data on GLP agonism than anyone in the world and starting with tirzepatide, of course, which is a combo GLP1 GIP agonist and the head to head study against a pure GLP1 agonist and you can see some profoundly different effects here looking at, for example, efficacy relative to tolerability. It looks like the GIP is boosting efficacy while also reducing the side effects that limit tolerability. So that was our initial evidence in human trials that involved well now tens of thousands of patients have been on tirzepatide in trials.  And then we went out to sort of prove this point by creating a pure GIP 1 agonist that just agonizes GIP to see what that could do alone. And again we saw a very highly tolerated drug consistent with what we understand about the mechanism of GIP 1 that probably could suppress actually nausea, vomiting that lead to weight loss. So, I think human data trumps everything here, and we've got a ton of that. So we're pretty excited about gap agonism. I can't really say what will happen with antagonism, but like you said, it's pretty unusual to have opposing mechanisms both work in similar ways.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dan for the last one, Dave. \nDavid Ricks: Okay, thanks, Joe. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and of course your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly and Company. As I said, it's been a very productive year for Lilly so far, and we look forward to continuing this momentum through a busy end of year in fourth quarter. So thanks for dialing in today. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we did not address on the call. And hope everyone has a great rest of the week and rest of the day today. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance.  We're pleased with the strong financial performance this quarter, highlighted by continued acceleration of revenue growth, representing robust momentum in our core business. Q3 revenue increased 37% versus Q3 2022. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and from the COVID-19 antibodies, revenue increased 24% in Q3. This represents a quarter-over-quarter acceleration of revenue growth, driven by Mounjaro and the continued strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased to 81.7%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, the absence of COVID-19 antibody sales in Q3 2023, and higher realized prices partially offset by increases in manufacturing expenses. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by higher expenses associated with new product launches and additional indications, as well as compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 34%, primarily driven by higher development expenses for late stage assets and additional investments in early stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $2.98 billion, which negatively impacted EPS by $3.29. In Q3, 2022, acquired IP R&D charges totaled $62 million, or $0.06 of EPS. Operating income decreased 71% in Q3, driven by acquired IP R&D charges, partially offset by higher revenue associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio.  Operating income as a percent of revenue was approximately 6% for the quarter, and reflected a negative impact of approximately 31 percentage point attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our q3 effective tax rate was 84.6%. This represents an increase of approximately 74 percentage points compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the non-deductible acquired IP R&D charges incurred this quarter.  Other than the impact of acquired IP R&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously providing guidance. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $0.10 in Q3, a 95% decrease versus Q3 2022, inclusive of an increase of $1.22 of EPS associated with the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and a negative impact of $3.29 from the acquired IP R&D charges.  On slide 8, we quantify the effect of price rate and volume and revenue growth. This quarter U.S. revenue increased 21%. When excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 32% driven by robust growth of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 13% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro, access and savings cards dynamics.  Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by high single digits. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected Mounjaro access and saving card dynamics to have a meaningful impact on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of 2023, which was evident in Q3. Europe continued to post robust growth against this again this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine divestiture, revenue was up 7% in constant currency driven by volume growth of 11% primarily from Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz.  For Japan, Q3 revenue decreased 16% in constant currency. Excluding Mounjaro, which had a one time upfront payment associated with the sales collaboration agreement in the base period, revenue in Japan decreased 3% in constant currency, driven primarily by customer buying patterns related to [indiscernible]. Moving to China revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth of 25% partially offset by price decline. Volume growth in Q3 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We're encouraged by the growth we have seen this year in China.  Revenue in the rest of the world increased 23% in constant currency, as volume growth of 28% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you can see the new product and growth product categories combined, contributed approximately 17 percentage points of rolling growth for the quarter. The absence of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a headwind of nearly six percentage points to volume in Q3. This headwind will abate as COVID-19 antibody sales were minimal after the third quarter of 2022.  Lastly, revenue from the sales of rights to the olanzapine portfolio delivered nearly 22 percentage points of growth this quarter.  Slide 10 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 68% in Q3, driven by robust volume growth. The continued positive momentum is driven by the early breast cancer indication with steady performance in the metastatic indication. Jardiance continued its strong 2023 performance with worldwide revenue growth of 22% for the quarter. As you heard earlier in Q3 Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression.  In Q3 we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline 10% as volume growth in the U.S. was more than offset by lower prices driven by changes to estimates for rebates and discounts in both periods, as well as unfavorable segment mix and higher contracted rebates. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to healthcare professionals, now [ph] to start new patients on Trulicity.  Moving to slide 11, we continue to be pleased with the strong performance of Mounjaro, as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro revenue grew to just over $1.4 billion globally this quarter, up from $980 million the previous quarter. In Q3, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro. As of October 1 access for patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.S. reached 78% in aggregate across commercial and Part D, including 85% access for commercial patients. This expanded access gives more patients the opportunity to start therapy on Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes.  As communicated last quarter, since the $25 non-covered copay card program expires on June 30, we now consider all prescriptions paid. As a reminder we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 non-covered copay card, but inclusive of the $25 covered copay card. We expect Mounjaro net price will continue to benefit from the higher percentage of paid prescription, but will also continue to face a headwind for more rebated volume as access improves.  Looking forward to the end of the year with increased access we expect to continue to see overall growth in prescription trends. In terms of Mounjaro supply, we're continuing to make progress in our manufacturing expansion agenda. Given strong demand, we continue to experience tight supply throughout most of Q3, which impacted results for the quarter. Most recently U.S. product shipments have increased and inventory levels at U.S. wholesalers have improved with all doses of Mounjaro now listed as available on the FDA shortage website.  While supply constraints have eased in the U.S., outside the U.S. Trulicity and -- outside the U.S. to Trulicity and Mounjaro supply remains tight, which materially impacted performance in these regions. With device assembly online at RTP, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling capacity by the end of this year from where we were a year ago, and are gradually increasing production each quarter.  We're also continuing to focus on other parts of the supply chain, as demand is expected to remain high and production bottlenecks may shift over time. As we mentioned in last quarter's earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentation of Mounjaro to reach more patients around the world faster. We have launched with a single dose vial in Australia, and plan to launch in other markets outside the U.S. in the coming weeks and months.  The introduction of a single dose vial presentation in these geographies is intended to serve as a bridge to a multi-dose quick pen, which we expect will be available starting in 2024. We're also preparing for potential launch of tirzepatide for obesity in the U.S. this year. Our auto injector capacity and output continues to increase. And we look forward to bring tirzepatide to more patients in the months and years ahead.  On slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first nine months of 2023, we invested nearly $12 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we've returned nearly $4 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 13 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Guidance for the first four line items including revenue, gross margin percent, marketing and selling and administrative expenses and R&D expense is unchanged. I would note that we are trending towards the higher end of our estimates for gross margin and the top end of our ranges for operating expense categories. You'll see that we've updated guidance for acquired IP R&D charges, OID, tax rate EPS, to reflect the inclusion of IP R&D charges for completed transactions through Q3, and year-to-date results on equity investments and GAAP guidance. These updates do not include the effect of potential charges associated with pending or future business development transactions after Q3. We will provide our initial 2024 guidance when we report Q4 results.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Sure. So let me first start with reassuring you that there are no issues behind our decision to move the guidance date to -- or have it aligned with our Q4 earnings call. What it does do is it does help us have the yearend full results when we provide guidance for 2024. So previously, if we didn't have that, investors had to look at guidance range for the year and estimates based on midpoint, etc. This does enable us to close the year and then have a full view into 2024. It is aligned with our internal planning processes as well. And obviously is the way most companies and I believe all companies in our industry do that.  So nothing unique going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023, going into that other than just having the full data set for 2023."

            "content": "Yes. So we shared at CTAD, we were pleased with the data that we saw. And we're also pleased to see progress across the field in blood biomarkers. We definitely believe that this is incredibly important to drive access and early diagnosis in Alzheimer's disease. So you've seen us invest in a number of fronts, our own p tau 217, but also partnering with others who are working on good tests to elevate the area. So it's a strategy of raising all boats.  But yes, we did share our data. And we intend to make this available in a phased approach commercially as an LDT starting at the end of this year, in a couple of sites, and then continuing to expand over 2024. But at the same time, you'll see us continue to publish the data. We think that what's incredibly important in the field, is that good correlative data, particularly with amyloid PET, which is the gold standard in diagnosis is published and shared so that we can continue to make sure that we have high quality tests out there.  So that's part of our goal with delivering this test is to really set a standard for what blood tests should look like. So look forward to hearing more over the next coming months as we publish that data and then make that more broadly available."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks Anat. This quarter, we had significant pipeline progress as well as a high volume of activity at the major medical congresses, where we presented new data on multiple products across all of our therapeutic areas.  Starting with oncology, since our last earnings call, we announced top line results from the LIBRETTO-531 study evaluating Retevmo versus physicians' choice of multi kinase inhibitors as an initial treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer. As we presented at ESMO the study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 72% improvement in progression-free survival compared to Cabozantinib or Vandetanib. These data should establish Retevmo as the standard of care for the initial systemic treatment of patients with progressive advanced RET mutant medullary thyroid cancer, and we have work to do to ensure that all of these patients are identified and properly diagnosed.  We also shared detailed data from the Phase 3 LIBRETTO-431 study at ESMO in October, showing that Retevmo more than doubled progression free survival compared to chemotherapy plus Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic RET fusion positive non-small cell lung cancer. We hope these data in addition to others recently published, for other driver positive lung cancers will help accelerate genomic profiling at lung cancer diagnosis to guide initial treatment selection.  The results of LIBRETTO-531 and of LIBRETTO-431 were each simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Also at ESMO we should landmark five year results from a pre-planned interim analysis of the Phase 3 monarchE study, evaluating Verzenio in combination with endocrine therapy, compared to endocrine therapy alone, in patients with HR positive HER2 negative no positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence. The impact of two years of Verzenio treatment is observed well beyond the treatment period, reducing the risk of long term recurrence by 32% at five years.  These data reinforced two years of Verzenio plus endocrine therapy as the standard of care for high risk early breast cancer patients. Lastly, we shared data on imlunestrant, our oral SERD being studied in Phase 3 as a single agent and in combination therapy. The data shared included the first clinical data for imlunestrant in combination with everolimus or alpelisib as well as updated monotherapy from the Phase 1 EMBER study in patients with ER positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer.  We hope that imlunestrant could be an important future endocrine therapy backbone, in certain settings of breast cancer. And these new data show that the medicine can be safely combined with other agents utilized with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer.  Looking earlier in oncology pipeline, we shared preclinical data on three of our new pipeline agents at the triple meeting on molecular targets in cancer therapeutics in October. We shared preclinical data for first, a highly potent inhibitor of KRAS G12D, that is selective against wild type KRAS. Second, a highly potent and isoform selective pan-KRAS inhibitor, with activity against a broad spectrum of the most common activating KRAS mutations, and high selectivity of a wild type H RES and N RES. And third, a fully human monoclonal anti-Nectin-4 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor.  These programs are among the next slate of oncology agents we expect to enter the clinic over the next year. They represent years of focused work to create potentially differentiated molecules against exacting target product profiles.  Turning to our diabetes and obesity portfolio, in Q3, we announced the FDA approval of Jardiance for treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression. In the EMPA-KIDNEY Phase 3 trial Jardiance significantly reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular deaths in adults with CKD. This approval adds to the treatment options for the more than 35 million adults in the U.S. affected by chronic kidney disease.  Since our last earnings call, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-3 Phase 3 clinical trial at the obesity weight conference in October, with the results simultaneously published in Nature Medicine. Also in October, we presented detailed results from the SURMOUNT-4 study at EASD. These results will be subsequently published in a top tier peer reviewed medical journal.  Data from these Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide showed that participants achieved up to 26.6% total mean weight loss. The detailed results from these studies clearly show the importance of continued therapy for sustained weight management, and that if approved, tirzepatide could be an important part of obesity management, for those having difficulty maintaining weight loss with diet and exercise alone.  Our pipeline, as shown on slide 14, now includes a high dose tirzepatide NILEX in Phase 2, since we have initiated a study exploring higher doses of tirzepatide in participants with type 2 diabetes and obesity. Earlier in the pipeline, we presented Phase 1 data on Muvalaplin at the European Society of Cardiology Congress with simultaneous publication in JAMA [ph]. Muvalaplin is the first oral agent specifically developed to lower Lp(a) levels. In this Phase 1 study Muvalaplin was well tolerated by participants and resulted in dose dependent lowering of Lp(a) of up to 65%. Muvalaplin is currently in Phase 2.  As shown on slide 14, we've advanced our SCAP siRNA into Phase 1 for NASH. We've also completed our acquisition of Versanis and NASH Bimagrumab [ph] in Phase 2. We are excited about the potential combination of Bimagrumab and tirzepatide.  Lastly, we're happy to share that since our last earnings call the Retatrutide TRIUMPH Phase 3 core registration trials are now all actively enrolling to pursue simultaneous indications for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea, and knee osteoarthritis.  Turning to our neuroscience portfolio, the FDA has shared with us that the Donanemab review will extend into Q1 2024 needing additional time to complete their review. We've completed submissions in Europe and Japan, and submissions to other global regulatory authorities are either completed or underway. Recently, at the clinical trials on Alzheimer's disease meeting, we presented new insights from donanemab development program during a symposium session.  As part of this symposium, we shared ARIA data from a pooled analysis that included more than 2000 participants dosed with donanemab, and explored ARIA E association across a number of baseline variables, highlighting a few key factors most strongly associated with ARIA risk, including baseline amyloid levels, evidence of a prior bleed and high blood pressure. Interestingly, this data also suggested use of antihypertensives decreased the risk of ARIA.  Additionally, we shared analyses from our open label addendum of over 1,000 patients treated with donanemab. These results included a post hoc analysis of patients with no brain tau, and demonstrated similar or even stronger biomarker results than our main TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study. In a separate post hoc analysis from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 Phase 3 study, related to activities of daily living and independence, in people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease we showed that compared to placebo, people treated with donanemab preserved more of their ability to perform many of the items measured, including their ability to make meals, to use appliances, keep appointments, perform pastimes, and be safely left unattended.  We also shared an update on our validation data for our Plasma P tau 217 test for identifying amyloid positive patients demonstrating robust performance of this immunoassay. We expect to have this test commercially available in a phased approach first, as a laboratory developed test by the end of this year.  As you recall, we use Plasma P tau 207 to identify pre symptomatic individuals for our TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial. This is an event driven trial and we have now recruited a sufficient number of qualifying pre-symptomatic participants and expect to have efficacy results within three years. We're excited to announce today that our Otoferlin Gene therapy asset from Akouos has begun dosing patients in a Phase 1/2 trial for hearing loss.  In immunology, as Dave noted, we're happy to have FDA approval for Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This approval offers new hope for patients, who are searching for an effective option that can offer rapid and lasting improvements. Omvoh will be approved --available to patients in the U.S. in the coming weeks. We were also excited to have the Phase 3 readout for this molecule, mirikizumab in Crohn's disease. In the VIVID 1 Phase 3 study mirikizumab met the co-primary in all major secondary endpoints compared to placebo. Mirikizumab demonstrated clinical remission and endoscopic response for patients with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease through 52 weeks. We were thrilled to see that more than half of participants on mirikizumab achieved clinical remission at one year, and that robust efficacy was seen in both participants who are naive to biologic therapy, as well as participants who previously failed a prior biologic therapy.  Helping patients achieve long term clinical remission is a key goal for us in our pursuit of treatments for inflammatory bowel disease. These new data in Crohn's Disease build on the high levels of long term remission seen with mirikizumab for ulcerative colitis, and help reinforce the differentiation of this important potential medicine. This successful Phase 3 trial will be the basis of global regulatory submissions for Crohn's Disease.  As Dave noted earlier in Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter for lebrikizumab, based on findings at a third party manufacturer. In Q3 we completed the acquisition of DICE and now reflect the two oral IL-17 assets, DICE 853 and DICE 806 in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of our pipeline respectively. Additionally, two new molecules began Phase 2 studies in immunology this quarter. First, our CD200R monoclonal antibody, known as Ucenprubart for atopic dermatitis, and second, our RIPK1 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis.  We've removed our BTLA monoclonal antibody agonist from Phase 2 in our pipeline, after the Phase 2a study failed to demonstrate efficacy. Q3 was another productive quarter for R&D at Lilly.  I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Thanks, Seamus. Yeah, I like the way you phrase it all hands on deck moving forward on orforglipron. We're really excited about this molecule. In terms of, liver safety, I think we commented before that, what we saw in Phase 2 is what we thought would be probably be typical for a trial of that nature in this population.  So not a heightened level of concern, but always concerned about safety going into Phase 3 from a variety of factors, including for all small molecules, especially liver function. So it's routine in our Phase 3 studies across the portfolio to monitor liver function. And sure we're doing that in orforglipron, but not aware of any special precautions there. So super excited that that program is going fast. No, excited about the opportunity. There's lots of work to do in immunology, given the depth of unmet medical needs and the science is great here. So I hope we can continue to bring great drugs to market as we're doing with mirikizumab. And we hope to do with Lebrikizumab soon and more to come. orforglipron: So there's no hesitation or trepidation there at all. I think though notwithstanding those two molecules, which I expect to be great and important contributors to human health, we have, tirzepatide. I'm not exactly sure if we've maximized the dose response, if we hit the flat part of the dose response curve yet. It looks like we might be close. But we want to explore it. And so we're testing the higher doses in Phase 2. I think we've had enough patients on this drug for long enough that I expect the risk of uncovering a new safety signal with sort of marginally higher doses is extremely low. So not worried about that at all. I don't know. I can start maybe. Maybe Mike has some to add here. Look, I'm excited to see that data, of course, as everyone else's. But the top line looks good. For me, I think we're sort of creating now data points on a line that connect the level of weight loss with the degree of cardiovascular benefit. I think this point fits on that line reasonably well. That line which was greater health benefits, including better, a fewer mace outcomes with greater degrees of weight loss bodes very well for Mounjaro data, given the very high degrees of weight loss that we saw in our trials. I'll leave it at that. See if Mike wants to add. Yes, so you're asking about kidney disease. I mean, I think the profound effect that incretin seem to be having on the kidneys is really a nice and important additive benefit here. This is something that's been observed with multiple class members now and they expect it will extend into our incretins as well. So it's exciting and I think proof that these drugs perhaps in addition to weight loss and A1C control, could have other direct metabolic benefits including the kidney. Yeah, thanks, Seamus. Maybe to paraphrase Dave's previous answers, it's sort of in all of the above here, I think there's great opportunities on the oral as a standalone therapy for initiation of therapy. Also, yes, for maintenance therapy globally. And also, yes, for potential combinations. You know, I point out the obvious fact that this is a GLP. One monotherapy. So we benchmark it against the best injectable GLP1 monotherapy. But I don't expect as an oral it will achieve the same levels of efficacy we can see with dual agonism like tirzepatide. So the future certainly will hold combinations like that. Thank you. Yeah, I'll take that. I, of course, say we have now I think more data on GLP agonism than anyone in the world and starting with tirzepatide, of course, which is a combo GLP1 GIP agonist and the head to head study against a pure GLP1 agonist and you can see some profoundly different effects here looking at, for example, efficacy relative to tolerability. It looks like the GIP is boosting efficacy while also reducing the side effects that limit tolerability. So that was our initial evidence in human trials that involved well now tens of thousands of patients have been on tirzepatide in trials.  And then we went out to sort of prove this point by creating a pure GIP 1 agonist that just agonizes GIP to see what that could do alone. And again we saw a very highly tolerated drug consistent with what we understand about the mechanism of GIP 1 that probably could suppress actually nausea, vomiting that lead to weight loss. So, I think human data trumps everything here, and we've got a ton of that. So we're pretty excited about gap agonism. I can't really say what will happen with antagonism, but like you said, it's pretty unusual to have opposing mechanisms both work in similar ways."

            "name": "Michael Mason",
            "content": "Yeah, thanks for the question. Maybe I'll first answer with the data that we do have, because it's hard to speculate on what it's going to be for obesity. The best data we have for tirzepatide is in Type 2 diabetes patients who started Mounjaro prior to our savings card changes last fall Mounjaro persistency for those patients is tracking higher than those patients that were started on trulicity and Ozempic, over that same period of time.  So while it's too early to project the average length of therapy or how many out of 100 will still be on therapy after a couple of years, I think that this early data is encouraging. As for obesity, time was time was going to tell. I think we've all looked at Wegovy data, but I don't think this is the right benchmark at this point because of novel supply constraints. And there's been just a very dynamic market. I think, as you said, this -- having persistency on a chronic treatment isn't just an issue for anti-obesity medications. It's a goal for all chronic treatments.  I think what's different about obesity is that, on many chronic treatments, consumers don't feel differently or experience any acute impacts from stopping treatments. So what we've seen in this SURMOUNT clinical trials, with tirzepatide is that some consumers will feel their appetite increase and experience weight regain when they stopped tirzepatide. And so this should help reinforce treatment adherence, seeing in our market research how important it is for people who live with obesity to lose weight and maintain it.  I do think you're going to see just a high motivation as people have lost weight that they do want to maintain it. And we do know for our SURMOUNT program that, chronic use of tirzepatide is a good component, an important component of maintaining weight loss. So it's too early to project it. But I do think there's things that's rolling in favor of tirzepatide having a good length of therapy in the obesity patient. No, I don't think that'll have an impact. I mean, traditionally, we don't see a new class of diabetes agents coming in and affecting a current class. Usually the competition happens within a specific class within a diabetes market. Yeah, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're not going to talk about price prior to approval. We're evaluating every scenario. We will make the right decision for patients who live with obesity. Thanks, Yeah, no, David, it's a good question. One that we've obviously spent a ton of time on and done a lot of internal analysis and a lot of planning on. We will have a whole suite of real world evidence and pragmatic trials so that we can answer this question clearly, for payers and other stakeholders. In our conversations with payers, while they're concerned about the short term budget impact, they do understand that losing weight will have benefits. It's not that hard of a sale, because they do understand the benefits are intuitive.  If you look at the total number of like obesity rate of complications, there's over 200. And you look at some of these are just really devastating and very costly, like type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia. And then when you look at the cost of these, on the U.S. alone, there's $370 billion in direct medical costs associated with obesity-related comorbidities, and over a trillion in indirect annual cost. When payers see that, people living with obesity and overweight, drive 2.7 times greater healthcare costs, than normal individuals, that data does get their attention.  And so I think over time will continue to provide health economics data, but also I think the voice of those living with obesity will be very important in this. This is a disease that, that really materially impacts someone's both health and mental functioning. And is really important for people who live with obesity. Their goal is to is to lose weight and maintain that so they can help their long term health benefits. And they're going to have a loud voice in this. I think both in commercial insurance as well as in states and the federal government. And so I do -- I am confident over time that we will see increase in access.  I think the most recent report shows that there's 50 million people in the U.S. that has access to obesity medication. So it will take time, but I think -- do think more and more payers are appreciating the value that anti-obesity medications especially when we get approval for tirzepatide will offer them. Thanks. Yeah, no, it's a good question. It will ramp up. We're trying to be disciplined. And we're trying to make sure that we bring on access as quickly, as is prudent. And so just like we did with Mounjaro we will take and make sure that we sometimes access has to materialize at an organic pace where it makes sense. And we'll make sure and use our judgment. So just like with Mounjaro, while we'd love to get out of the gate quickly, most importantly, as a setup for long term success. So you'll see a kind of a natural ramp up that you would with any new product. And I think it's important, as you look in the first quarter of our launch last January, when you saw Wegovy resupply. They were resupplying into a market where they already had capacity.  So I think when you look at our access, and you look at our volume as we head into next year, you'll see a ramp up in volume as you see a ramp up in our access. Probably the key question I'm looking at is like how much of the effect was driven by drug effect versus weight loss is probably the key question we're looking at. Yeah, no, I'd be happy to do that. I think maybe at a macro level, I would say that our gross to net for Mounjaro in Q3, that kind of normalized. Before then we had a number of saving card changes that that, made our gross to net rate dynamic. Our last and copay card change occurred late in Q2, so at the end of June. And so Q3 was a kind of a pure quarter, where we didn't have any other copay card changes. And I would say that our Mounjaro rate normalized at that point, you know, going forward, I think what you'll see is what you see normally for a product at this point in the lifecycle that as we pursue gaining access, there'll probably be some pricing pressure related to that. But we don't have any other coping card changes planned in the near future. Yeah, and I'll happy to do that, Obviously, it's too early to really impact how IRA will have an impact and the impact will have another product within the class. I think what you know, what's important for tirzepatide is it is the first dual acting incretin. And we do think it has a unique profile. And in head to head results in type 2 diabetes, it did show superior, both I1C and weight to semaglutide. And so at the end of the day, I think the profile of the product will carry the day. And obviously more to come on the IRA. As the first products go through the negotiation, we see the impact, but we're confident in the profile of tirzepatide."

            "name": "David Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. In Q3 Lily continued the progress we made so far this year. We delivered strong financial results continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invested in our future through several business development transactions.  As you can see on slide 4, we continue to make progress against our strategic deliverables this quarter. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, and COVID-19 antibodies, revenue grew 24%. Our new products and growth products combined contributed approximately 17 percentage points toward volume growth, with over 12 percentage points coming from our growth products.  Last week, we announced that the FDA approved Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults. This marks Lilly's first approval in the U.S. for a type of inflammatory bowel disease. And it's important for Lilly's growth in its immunology portfolio. In addition to the FDA approval for Omvoh, we had several other important pipeline updates since our last earnings call.  Specifically Jardiance was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, at risk of progression. And we reported positive Phase 3 results from the VIVID-1 trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of mirikizumab for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  In Q3, we announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter for lebrikizumab based on inspection findings at a third party manufacturer. The letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package, the safety or the label. We will continue to work with the third party manufacturer and the FDA to address the findings to make lebrikizumab available to patients as quickly as possible.  In terms of business development, we once again had a very active quarter. In Q3, we completed the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio, which will further enable us to focus on our current and new product launches. The financial impact of this transaction is reflected in the Q3 results. Additionally, within the quarter, we completed the acquisition of two clinical stage companies, adding to our Phase 2 portfolio, DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio as well as the acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics and Sigilon Therapeutics. We also announced that we reached an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma, which, if approved, has the potential to expand our oncology capabilities into next generation radioligand therapies. And lastly, we distributed over a $1 billion in dividends this quarter.  On slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q2 call, including several important regulatory clinical and other updates we're sharing today.  Now let me turn the call over Anat to review our Q3 results. Thank you, Dan. Before we get to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the third quarter. This quarter revenue growth accelerated as our recently launched product portfolio continued to gain momentum, of course led by Mounjaro. Excluding revenue from the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio and the sale of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, revenue grew 24%, driven again by Mounjaro, Verzenio as well as Jardiance.  By continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, late stage medicines and early phase capabilities as well as in business development, we are confident that we have positioned ourselves for growth now and in the coming years, with the opportunity for continued margin expansion. We achieved meaningful advances in our late stage pipeline, with the FDA approval of Omvoh for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, as well as Jardiance for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease, and the positive Phase 3 VIVID 1 results for mirikizumab for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.  Looking forward, we are expecting regulatory responses before the end of the year on our submissions for pirtobrutinib, and accelerated approval in CLL as well as tirzepatide for obesity. In Q3, we completed several targeted acquisitions, intended to bolster our early and mid stage portfolio. Directly following the quarter we also announced an agreement to acquire POINT Biopharma which will further expand our R&D capabilities in oncology.  Lastly, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. A few weeks ago, we announced several leadership changes. Mike Mason, our Executive Vice President and President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity will retire from the company at the end of 2023 after 34 years with Lilly. In his current role, Mike is overseeing tirzepatide, late stage development and an unprecedented type 2 diabetes launch. Mike leaves behind an enduring legacy that reflects his deep compassion for patients and his commitment to our people. With this being Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him for his many years of outstanding service to Lily and wish him all the best in his next chapter of life.  Patrick Johnson will assume leadership of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity. In addition to his current responsibilities as President of Lilly USA Dan Skovronsk, our Chief Scientific Officer and president of Lilly Research Labs will take on the additional role of President of Lilly Immunology from Patrick. And in a related move, David Hyman is assuming the role of Chief Medical Officer for the company from Dan, overseeing the full Lilly portfolio. Leigh Ann Pusey, our Executive Vice President for Corporate Affairs and Communications has decided to leave the company at the end of 2023. Leigh Ann has left a lasting impact on Lilly and the patients we serve. And we're grateful for her many contributions over the past six years.  So as we begin this new chapter of growth for our company, we are very confident that our deep experience of our leadership team will allow us to continue to accelerate our efforts to make medicines and be more effective and more innovative in the years ahead.  So now, let me turn the call over to Joe and he'll moderate the Q&A session. Yeah, thanks, Geoff. Obviously a hot topic. We work on this multiple hours every day. You're citing the announcements we've made and as mentioned great progress is showing manufacturing agenda RTP sort of on track to deliver on its goal. But as we exit the year, and then that kind of in market volume following that Concord, which is a few hours away, and kind of a replica site also, well on track for coming online in '24. So that's good news in the ERMA [ph] presentation, which is -- what we call our auto injector, from trulicity, and the current presentation from Mounjaro in the U.S. We've announced previously that we're introducing now single use vial presentation ex-U.S., so that we aren't basically sitting on approvals and connect patients have access to the medication.  That will follow them by a multi use injector that uses different property, plant and equipment than what we're talking about here. So a couple of things to point out. You're noting kind of new greenfield site expansions. We've rightfully made a big deal out of. We're not done with those. I think you might hear more about that in the future. Of course, we are aggressively planning that and not banking on or forced upon to rescue us from this. We think that there is a need to take up parenteral incretin supply pretty dramatically from the current levels. And we plan to do that.  But that will be in a combination of the current syringe-based auto injector, the vial capacity, we've already talked about. The multi use injector, which will come online sometime next year, and is a highly efficient play for us because it uses current systems and different ones from the auto injector. And then there's third party agreements that have been ongoing in the background. And to point out here, we are not relying on one. We have a diverse portfolio of third parties, recognizing that, the probability of full supply from any one is probably less than one. But buying up as much capacity as available in all those systems.  So we've got a, I think the all hands on deck phrase was used earlier. I mean, this is really all hands on deck. And it's a problem we work every day. So we're not at all happy with the capacity. We've announced already, you'll see more. Some we don't announce that we'll just layer in to the volume we ship. And of course, long term new presentations like solid oral opens up even more possibilities, but we need to do everything we can now given the huge potential for global obesity treatment for our medicines to play a key role in that, and then ultimately impact hundreds of millions of people.  So a lot of work to do here yet ahead. Thanks for the question. Sure, I can start and let Dan comment. Look, we've been really pleased with this business, which I think is important to take the long view here. I mean, I was involved in creating this like 10 years ago, and both [indiscernible] and now mirikizumab, and hopefully soon Lebrikizumab will form a really core portfolio for us, really exploiting ideas that we had some time ago. What's next, and you see here today advancing another checkpoint agonist into Phase 2 is a lot of decisions about, okay, what's next to take immunology to the next level. And that's largely going to be about key decisions, both internal portfolio and potentially externally, like with our DICE acquisition, to find a new set of either single agent or combinations that can raise the standard of care in tough immunology diseases, noting, in particular in IBD and RA, the standard of care is hardly satisfied today.  We measure real pretty low performance status of success. So that's the mission that Dan and we've hired Mark Genovese to the company and others to really build a portfolio the future. So I don't Dan, if you want to Okay, thanks, Joe. We appreciate everyone's participation in today's earnings call and of course your ongoing interest in Eli Lilly and Company. As I said, it's been a very productive year for Lilly so far, and we look forward to continuing this momentum through a busy end of year in fourth quarter. So thanks for dialing in today. Please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we did not address on the call. And hope everyone has a great rest of the week and rest of the day today. Take care."

            "content": "Sure, first, thanks for the question. From a trulicity standpoint, we had healthy growth coming into later part of last year. And we've been pretty transparent with both physicians as well as regulators that due to the tight supply, we are encouraged not to start new patients. We continue with that, to be transparent. We think it's the right thing to do. And as we think about the growth in incretin, we're looking as we build up capacity, as David mentioned.  As we increase capacity both in the single use vial and introduce Mounjaro in additional markets as we have in Australia and we will continue over the next number of weeks and months in other markets and then transition towards a multi-use platform in quick time in introducing Mounjaro. And so the overall growth in incretin will be mainly driven by as we are able to launch Mounjaro in new markets that's probably will go get the growth. Thank you for the question."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 3. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent Forms 10-Q and 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn over the call to Dave.\nDavid Ricks: Thanks, Joe. In the second quarter, Lilly's momentum continued. We advanced our R&D pipeline, progressed our ambitious manufacturing agenda and delivered strong financial results. Our business saw an acceleration of revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. As base period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue and Alimta's loss of exclusivity recede, we do expect strong growth to continue in the quarters ahead. Lilly has made substantial progress in advancing our pipeline of innovative medicines in recent years, but the past few months have been particularly noteworthy. In early May, we shared the top line results of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed donanemab treatment slowed clinical decline in Alzheimer's by 35%. While differences in enrollment criteria and study design make cross-trial comparisons difficult, this represents the greatest percentage cognitive slowing in a primary end point of any disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment reported to date, and the only Phase II to Phase III replication to date. Three weeks ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we shared the detailed results, including new analysis, which demonstrates the potential of even greater cognitive slowing in patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease. At the ADA scientific sessions in June, we shared positive Phase II data on 2 next-generation diabetes and obesity product candidates: orforglipron and retatrutide. And less than 2 weeks ago, we shared top line results from the SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 Phase III trials, which showed participants on tirzepatide following intensive lifestyle intervention or with continued tirzepatide treatment, achieved up to 26.6% mean weight loss. Dan will share more perspectives in his R&D update on these and other exciting areas of pipeline progress. Moving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the continued progress made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, Q2 revenue grew 22% on 23% volume growth. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, which leads our new products category. That category also includes Jaypirca and now Omvoh, which saw its first sales in Japan in Q2 and launched in Germany in July. In the second quarter of this year, new products and growth products categories combined contributed approximately 26 percentage points of volume growth. These products, coupled with potential upcoming launches, solidify Lilly's strong growth profile through this decade. We've had several important pipeline updates since our Q1 earnings call. For mirikizumab, approval in the EU and resubmission of our U.S. application with regulatory action expected by the end of this year. Regulatory submissions in the U.S. for tirzepatide for chronic weight management; regulatory submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA following the positive Phase III results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial; and positive Phase III top line readouts for SURMOUNT-3 and 4 in the third and fourth global studies evaluating tirzepatide in chronic weight management. The second quarter also was productive for business development. We've commented in the past on our active exploration and pursuit of external innovation and are pleased to have announced agreements to acquire 2 clinical-stage companies in the second quarter: DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio. These companies operate in different therapeutic areas, and each is a fit with Lilly's strategy. We also closed the sale of global rights to Baqsimi, and the financial impact of this transaction is reflected in our Q2 results. After quarter end, we closed the sale of rights to our olanzapine portfolio, which will be reflected in our Q3 financial results. Both these transactions are now incorporated into our updated 2023 financial guidance. We continued to progress the most ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda in the 147 history of our company. We're happy to share that commercial production to support our incretin portfolio has begun at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. Beyond the capacity expansion that will come as we ramp production at this site, we're also pursuing other near-term paths to expand access to our incretins to patients around the world. Anat will provide more detail on these efforts. And finally, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we're sharing today. So without further ado, I'll turn this over to Anat to share our Q2 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments today on non-GAAP performance. In Q2, revenue increased 28% versus Q2 of 2022. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from COVID-19 antibodies in the base period, revenue increased 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This acceleration on revenue growth was achieved despite lingering headwinds from Alimta's loss of exclusivity in the United States, which occurred in the first half of last year, and the effects of which should normalize going forward. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was flat in Q2 at 79.8%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from product mix, including onetime revenue from the sales of rights to Baqsimi, which was offset by increases in manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and our investments in capacity expansion. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming new product launches and additional indications. R&D expenses increased 32%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $97 million or $0.09 of EPS. In Q2 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $440 million or $0.46 of EPS. Operating income increased 69% in Q2 driven by higher revenue, including revenue associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi and lower IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 27% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 115 basis points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges.  Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.1%. This represents an increase of 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 driven by the impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime in the sales of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.11 in Q2, a 69% increase versus Q2 of 2022, inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue increased 41%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi, U.S. revenue grew 30% driven by robust growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 2% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by low single digits, consistent with prior trends.  As I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we expect Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics to have an even greater effect on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of this year.  Europe continued its growth trajectory with revenue in Q2 up 6% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 12% in the second quarter. For Japan, Q2 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as we continue to see robust growth in our newer medicine, led by Verzenio, and to a lesser extent, Jardiance, Olumiant and Mounjaro, the last of which launched in Japan in April.  Moving to China. Revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth only minimally offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We are pleased to see our China business return to growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 19% in constant currency as volume growth of 20% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you may recall on our Q1 earnings call, we simplified the categorization of our products with a focus on 2 categories: new products and growth products. As you can see, the new and growth categories combined contributed 26 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The volume growth for all others category was driven by the sale of rights to Baqsimi. The lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a milder headwind to growth in Q2 compared to Q1 and will continue to be a modest impact to prior year comparisons.  Slide 10 provides additional perspectives across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 57% in Q2 as OUS volume grew 82%, while U.S. volume grew 47%. Jardiance also continued its strong performance with worldwide sales growth of 45% for the quarter.  There have been 2 notable regulatory approval for Jardiance in the last 2 months. In June, the FDA approved Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children 10 years and older, making Jardiance the first and only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for this patient population. And in late July, Jardiance was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease. After almost a decade on the market, Jardiance continues to demonstrate its importance to patients across a number of cardiorenal metabolic conditions.  Trulicity performance has held up well in a growing and dynamic incretin market. In Q2, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline by 5% as modest volume growth was more than offset by price erosion. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to initiate patients on Trulicity. We remain confident that Trulicity will continue to be an important option for HCPs and patients in years to come.  Moving to Slide 11. I will share some perspective on Mounjaro's performance. We continue to be pleased with the strong momentum of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro's revenue in the U.S. grew to $960 million for the quarter. In Q2, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro, and access reached 73% on July 1 for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts from Mounjaro in Q2 was approximately 67%, up from approximately 55% in Q1.  As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 noncovered co-pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay card program expired in June 30, we would expect the proportion of paid script next quarter to be 100% under this definition.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect continued growth in new-to-brand prescription as well as ongoing improvement in access.  Lastly, regarding the demand and supply outlook for incretin. We're pleased that commercial production has started at our RTP site in North Carolina. Even as we ramp up capacity at RTP, we believe supply will likely remain tight in the coming months and quarters due to significant demand.  Given the expected global demand for tirzepatide, as we mentioned on previous earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentations to bring tirzepatide to more patients faster. To this end, we initiated a bioequivalent study in early April for a multi-dose quick pen device. In many OUS markets, we expect to launch tirzepatide first in valve form later this year and transition to a multi-dose quick pen as approved and available in these markets starting in 2024. The launch of the valve and quick pen presentations for tirzepatide will leverage existing manufacturing assets and capacity. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the number of people we can help in the short term and long term with these additional options.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first 6 months of 2023, we invested $5.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 3 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Given the strong performance in our underlying business as well as revenue from the sales of rights for Baqsimi and olanzapine, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance by $2.2 billion to a range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activities, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi, while the remainder reflects strong underlying business performance.  Our updated FX assumptions based on recent spot rates are listed and represents a de minimis impact to the updated guidance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue has increased to approximately 80% driven by the sales of rights for Baqsimi and our olanzapine portfolio.  We're also increasing the range of operating expense guidance for the year. Marketing, selling and administrative costs are now expected to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with the increase driven by additional investments in recent launches in preparation for launches of new medicine and line extensions expected later this year.  The range for research and development expenses has been increased to $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion, reflecting positive dynamics across our portfolio, including success in events in our early-stage assets, positive enrollment trends in our late-stage studies, broadening of the clinical program for next-generation incretin, and expected incremental expenses from business development activities.  We have incorporated IPR&D charges that have been incurred through Q2 2023, which totaled $202 million. Other income and expense and tax rate guidance have also been updated. OID is now expected to be between $0 million and $100 million in income, up from prior guidance of $100 million to $200 million in expense. We've also increased our estimated effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, up from approximately 13%, reflecting the impact of the sales of rights for our olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi.  Based on these changes, we have raised our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share and raised our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. It's been a productive and busy few months for Lilly R&D. Since our last earnings call, we've had a few major readouts across our therapeutic areas, and we've announced several business development transactions. Let me start with the data that we shared in June at the American Diabetes Association. We presented over 40 abstracts across our portfolio and shared data during 2 ADA-sponsored symposia. The first was for the Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-2 study of tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight in type 2 diabetes, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the second symposium was for the results from 2 Phase II trials of retatrutide, our GIP/GLP glucagon tri-agonist in adults with obesity and overweight as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. The retatrutide results in obesity and type 2 diabetes were simultaneously published in New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, respectively. We also shared an oral presentation on our Phase II trial results for orforglipron, our once-daily, non-peptide oral GLP-1 in adults with obesity or overweight. These results were simultaneously published in New England Journal. We also presented results from a Phase II trial of orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these were published in the Lancet. Clearly, we're proud of all of this data in diabetes and obesity portfolio. Since we discussed the top line data for SURMOUNT-2 tirzepatide trial during our last earnings call, I'll focus my updates today on the Phase II data shared for orforglipron and retatrutide, starting with orforglipron on Slide 14. The orforglipron presentation highlighted safety and efficacy data across 6 dose arms in our Phase II study in obesity. With an overall mean body weight at baseline of 109 kilograms, orforglipron demonstrated an average of up to 14.7% body weight reduction at 36 weeks. At the second highest dose tested in the study, 75% of participants reached a weight reduction goal of 10% or more. We also shared data showing a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure and an overall improvement in lipid levels. The most common adverse events were GI-related and generally occurred earlier in the trial during the titration phase and were mostly mild to moderate. While we've not yet shared the dosing details for our Phase III studies, these Phase II results have informed our approach on dose escalation. We also presented data at ADA from a similar Phase II study of orforglipron in people with type 2 diabetes, the results of which are highlighted on Slide 15. Orforglipron demonstrated a mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c at 26 weeks of up to 2.1%, and over 90% of participants on the highest 3 doses achieved A1c levels less than 7%. We initiated Phase III trials for orforglipron in both obesity and type 2 diabetes in the second quarter, and we look forward to those results in 2025.  For retatrutide, the full results of 2 Phase II trials were presented during an ADA-sponsored symposium, which discussed efficacy and safety in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. There's also a segment of the symposium focused on liver fat and NASH-related biomarker data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which showed relative liver fat reduction of over 80% at 24 weeks for the is doses. Slide 16 highlights key results from the obesity Phase II trial in which retatrutide met the primary end point at 24 weeks, demonstrating mean weight reduction up to 17.5%. The safety profile of retatrutide was similar to other incretin-based therapies. In a secondary end point of weight reduction at 48 weeks, participants treated with the highest dose of retatrutide demonstrated a mean rate -- weight reduction up to 24.2% or almost 58 pounds on average. If confirmed in registrational trials, we believe that magnitude of mean weight reduction would represent a new high watermark for weight loss from a pharmacologic agent at this time point. It's also worth noting that the Phase II retatrutide trial in obesity was well balanced between genders with females representing just under half of all participants in the trial. This was intentional and is atypical for incretin clinical trials in obesity, which often have a higher proportion of female participants, a subgroup that typically experiences greater weight loss than males. Indeed, in the retatrutide Phase II obesity trial, the mean change in body weight for female participants at the highest dose was 28.5%. Given these encouraging results, we moved rapidly to initiate the Triumph Phase III program, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight and obesity. These 4 Phase III trials will each run between 68 and 80 weeks. The trajectory of weight loss seen in the Phase II study reinforces our belief that retatrutide can potentially represent a further improvement and additional option for patients seeking pharmacological treatment for obesity and its complications. While retatrutide's Phase II results in obesity garnered much attention at ADA, the Phase II results in patients with type 2 diabetes are also very encouraging with participants receiving retatrutide achieving a hemoglobin A1c reduction of up to 2% on average in addition to meaningful levels of weight loss. I'm pleased to share that we plan to advance retatrutide into Phase III for type 2 diabetes. Moving to tirzepatide on Slide 17. We were delighted to announce in late July that SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 trials of tirzepatide in obesity met all primary and key secondary objectives. In key secondary objectives for both these studies, participants achieved similar mean weight reduction, 26.6% in SURMOUNT-3 and 26.0% in SURMOUNT-4. While these 2 trials were not required for our chronic weight management submission to the FDA, they provide important additional information regarding the role tirzepatide plays in maintaining or adding to the weight loss achieved with either intensive lifestyle intervention or pharmacotherapy in adults living with obesity or overweight. SURMOUNT-3 evaluated tirzepatide following an intensive lifestyle modification program and demonstrated that even in people who have a weight loss response to lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide provides significant additional weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 was a randomized withdrawal study in which all participants received tirzepatide for a 36-week lead-in period, at which point, half the participants were switched to placebo and the other half continued treatment with tirzepatide. This study demonstrated that those participants who continued on tirzepatide experienced continued weight loss, while those who switched to placebo started to regain weight. These data reinforce our understanding that obesity is a complex chronic disease for which multiple treatment approaches, including lifestyle modification and effective medications, are needed. We believe tirzepatide is well positioned to be one such treatment option. Accordingly, we submitted an application for tirzepatide for chronic weight management to the FDA during Q2. The FDA granted this application priority review designation, and we anticipate FDA action by year-end. Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 4, and Slide 19 shows potential key events for the year. I've covered the major updates in diabetes, including the advancement of orforglipron and retatrutide into Phase III since our learning -- last earnings call. Turning then to our neuroscience portfolio. 3 weeks ago with the AIC meeting in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we were excited to share the detailed results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, highlighting donanemab's robust efficacy profile across a number of new analyses that reinforce our belief in the medicine's ability to meaningfully slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially in patients earlier in disease progression. We cover the results in some detail during our AIC investor call so I won't cover that again, except to note that we submitted donanemab to the FDA and to the EMA for approval, and we look forward to FDA action before the end of this year. Shifting to oncology. Launch progress continues with Jaypirca and mantle cell lymphoma, and we are pleased to have the detailed chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the BRUIN Phase I/II trial published in New England Journal in early July. Following the discussion with the FDA, we've now submitted an application for accelerated approval for Jaypirca in CLL patients previously treated with both a covalent BTK inhibitor and venetoclax based on the results from the BRUIN Phase I/II study. We expect FDA action by year-end. Also during the quarter, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for pirtobrutinib for patients with MCL. We continue to study pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase III trials and look forward to the results from the BRUIN 321 trial in CLL, which we now expect to see before the end of this year, and it has been added to our key events slide. In other oncology developments, at ASCO in June, we presented new data from the Verzenio monarchE trial in high-risk early breast cancer. For the first time, we showed data demonstrating the efficacy of the medicine in this setting is not compromised when patients undergo dose reductions. We believe that the ability to manage Verzenio's side effects while preserving efficacy could be very important to ensuring that patients complete their 2 years of therapy. This is an emerging part of Verzenio's differentiation in this class. We're also very excited about last week's announcement regarding the randomized trial of Retevmo in treatment-naive RET fusion-positive lung cancer. As we communicated in the press release, this randomized trial was declared successful on its primary end point of progression-free survival, the first time any targeted therapy in lung cancer has ever shown superiority to a PD-1 plus chemotherapy regimen. While we remain disappointed by the low levels of genomic profiling done at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, we're hopeful that these data will continue to advance the practice of genomic-driven medicine. We look forward to sharing the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting. In our earlier-stage oncology portfolio, the combination experiment of our KRAS G12C inhibitor with pembrolizumab continues to mature nicely. And we're now working to initiate Phase III trials in first-line G12C-mutated lung cancer in the next 6 to 9 months. More broadly, we're excited to see the overall progress of our oncology portfolio. In addition to last week's Retevmo announcement, we expect another 7 randomized trial readouts in 4 to 6 new first-in-human trials across small molecules and biologics in oncology over the next 12 months. With the acquisition of Loxo Oncology 4 years ago, we catalyzed a change in the strategy and direction of oncology at Lilly, and we're seeing the fruits of these efforts. Finally, in immunology, we have several updates related to mirikizumab. A Digestive Disease Week in May, we presented new analyses from the Phase III LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 studies, demonstrating that remission of key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including bowel urgency, was associated with significant improvement in the quality-of-life assessment in adults with UC. In Q2, we launched mirikizumab marketed as Omvoh in Japan as a treatment for adults with moderately to severe active UC. In late May, we received approval for Onvio in the EU and have subsequently launched Omvoh in Germany and planned additional launches in the EU later this year. In the U.S., we've resubmitted our application to the FDA. We now expect regulatory action by the end of this year. For lebrikizumab, our IL-13 monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for atopic dermatitis, we presented a new secondary analysis at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in May. This post-hoc analysis demonstrated improvement or clearance of face or hand dermatitis in adult and adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab. These are parts of the body that are highly visible and for which dermatitis can be particularly burdensome and stigmatizing. We expect regulatory action for lebrikizumab in both the U.S. and EU later this year. Together with Almirall, our development and commercialization partner in Europe, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, we're pleased in May to have the detailed results from our Phase IIa study of peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis published in the New England Journal. These data were first presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in late 2022 and represent the first clinical evidence that's stimulating the endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for Lilly R&D with important progress in each of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks: Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. This quarter saw an acceleration of revenue growth as our recently launched product portfolio gathers momentum. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi revenue, we grew 22% driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The quarter also saw a continuation of investment in our future growth in our manufacturing expansion, in late-stage medicines, in early phase capabilities and in business development. Notwithstanding these long-term investments, we continue to expect our revenue will grow more rapidly than our expense base in the coming years and see significant opportunity for margin expansion. We also achieved meaningful advances in our near-term pipeline with positive phase -- positive top line results, detailed data disclosures and submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA, and completion of the tirzepatide submission in chronic weight management, alongside positive top line results from 2 more Phase III trials for the SURMOUNT program. We also shared data from 4 mid-stage clinical trials for orforglipron and retatrutide and initiated Phase III trials for both assets. Lastly, we announced several targeted business development moves intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio and our R&D capabilities, and we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions]. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and then we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor.\nLouise Chen: Just wanted to ask you about the Novo SELECT study that came out this morning. What kind of read-throughs do you see for the industry? And do you think it will help improve reimbursement for obesity/overweight drugs?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Louis. We'll go to Mike for that question on the recent SELECT news.\nMichael Mason: Thanks, Louise. I assume we probably would get a question on the SELECT trial, and thanks for starting out the call with that. The SELECT trial read out as we expected. I think the results are great for the anti-obesity medication class. It should really support access for any payers who are on the fence of whether they should add anti-obesity medications or not. I think importantly, it should turn the conversation of the benefits of weight loss away from aesthetics and more toward the health benefit of people living with obesity. When you look overall, there are 236 obesity-related health complications. To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%. The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide's potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide's value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can't wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter. This is a fantastic day for people living with obesity. Now do I think most payers will adopt AOMs overnight because of SELECT trial? I don't think so. I think, as I said earlier, those who are on the fence, this will push them over. But I think it is an important milestone in a long-term goal to get broad access for anti-obesity medications.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America.\nGeoff Meacham: I know that we're a year into the , but I wanted to get a view of persistent rates. The question is, are you seeing drug holidays after weight loss troughs? And I wasn't sure if there were differences between diabetes and obesity indications at this point just with regard to duration of use.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Geoff. I'll go back to Mike for that question on persistence rates of Mounjaro.\nMichael Mason: Okay. Geoff, thanks for your question. Right now, we only market Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. So the only end-market real-world persistency rates that we have are for Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes patients. What we do know is that people living with type 2 diabetes have had good experiences with Mounjaro. In the first launch, like at the first phase of launch before we've made savings card and experienced supply spot outages, type 2 diabetes patients to Mounjaro did have better persistency than Trulicity, which is important because Trulicity historically has had the best compliance in the diabetes market. So we're confident in the experiences that people who use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes have. And we're excited to see what that will be for people living with product weight management when and if we get approved by the FDA.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson: So just going back to SELECT, a commonly held view is that positive results benefits every company in the category. And that's our view as well. But of course, Novo will be able to make the claim for quite some time that they're the only drug to have a proven cardiovascular benefit. So could that actually give them a big commercial advantage in the marketplace on things like payer coverage that would actually be to Lilly's detriment?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim. I'll go back to Mike for that question, a follow-up on SELECT.\nMichael Mason: No, it's a good question. I don't think that will be the case. What we've seen is payers opt into the class, not a particular drug. So I don't think that will give them a differential impact within payer access. I think commercially, typically, health care professionals when they see results like this, it really helps the class more than any one individual product.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: On the guidance, please, on OpEx. So clearly, operating costs higher than at least, the market anticipated in Q2. And you are now guiding to spend more on SG&A R&D through this year. So I'm just interested to learn more about what has changed through this quarter to continue to raise that OpEx outlook versus your previous record. Can you elaborate on the key drivers of that, please?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry, for the question. And yes, we'll go to Anat with that commentary on the OpEx guide and additional context.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Kerry, for the questions. So we have raised, you're right, both SG&A guidance as well as R&D. The SG&A increases are primarily as a result of continued investment in the upcoming launches we have yet this year. As we're seeing the opportunities, we're excited to divest efficiently behind these opportunities and make them a reality for patients and for Lilly. On the R&D side, Dan provided a robust outline of the progress we've seen in our pipeline. And there are really, I would say, 3 to 4 key drivers of that increase. One is additional new studies that we've announced primarily in Phase III. And you mean the broadening of the investments we're making in our incretin portfolio, initiating multiple Phase III studies for both orforglipron and retatrutide and announcing new studies, coupled with continued advancement. We're seeing great success in our early-stage pipeline and we're investing behind that. We're also seeing continued success in our enrollment rates for currently for our Phase III program. So that's continued to enroll well. And then the 3 business development transactions, the inbound that we've announced, are now going to be incorporated in our second half R&D run rate. So all these combined are the drivers of the increase this year. So they represent really a tremendous opportunity for continued investments in a very successful pipeline.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott: Can you just walk through expectations for Mounjaro volumes and ASP as you move through 3Q and 4Q just given the change in the patient assistance program on June 30 as well as the North Carolina facility coming online? I guess, specifically, I was just wondering, do the IQVIA scripts we're now seeing largely reflect the change to the patient assistant program? And then should we expect volumes from North Carolina to be a meaningful contributor to capacity this year? Or is that more 2024?\nJoe Fletcher: Was close to multiple questions there, Chris. But let me hand over to Mike to provide expectations on Mounjaro volume and gross-to-net dynamics as we move in the second half, given the RTP news, and then also given the changes to the co-pay program at the end of June. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Chris, thanks for those questions. Yes, we did make the change in the $25 savings, program did expire at the end of June 30. So anything that you see in IQVIA is post that change. And you'll see that volume of those individuals who were using an uncovered plan no longer in our trends. We were very happy with what we saw with Mounjaro-pay TRxes in the quarter as they grew nearly 60% in the quarter. As we go forward, we'll -- our manufacturing team is working on bringing on new capacity at North Carolina and then a few more areas. And as that production comes on and ramps up, we will see some benefit from that supply. I mean, ultimately, that will help build inventories up and help eliminate any spot outage that we see. In the short term, because we're seeing really unprecedented demand, we do still expect to see tight supply and some spot outages on Mounjaro through the end of the year. But I think ultimately as that manufacturing capacity ramps up, we will be out of the spot outages that we see. But in the next couple of months and quarters, I think we'll still see tightened [indiscernible].\nOperator: The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn: I was just wondering if you could provide any perspective on how you're thinking about the potential for a single brand, for Mounjaro, or a split brand ahead of the potential FDA action on the obesity indication?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Terence. Mike, I'll hand that over to you for commentary on single brand versus multiple brands for tirzepatide.\nMichael Mason: Yes. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating all alternatives, and we'll announce our decision at approval.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow: Congrats on the quarter. I heard the sort of positive commentary regarding the commercial supply coming online RTP. And just as we think about '24, how likely is it or what do you foresee in terms of supply potentially capping the sales potential in '24? And is the decision to move forward with the vials and multi-dose pen in any way related to delays at the RTP side?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Colin. I'm going to hand to Anat to talk a little bit about the RTP commercial supply and supply dynamics in the near term.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Colin, so let me first start with the end of your question on -- just to clarify RTP. So RTP is now live and producing for commercial purposes, and it's on line, in line with our expectations. So there are no delays. It's progressing as we had expected. I'm incredibly proud of the work that the manufacturing team have done to get us to this point. As Mike alluded, there will be a gradual increase in available capacity coming out of that site. We've mentioned in the past, it's a large site with multiple lines. They'll come online gradually and provide more products into the marketplace. As we think about 2024, I suggest we step back and look comprehensively at our manufacturing agenda and capacity plans. So RTP is one side. It's obviously of high interest just because of the proximal nature, and that's the first one that's launched out of the number of sites we have under construction. In parallel, we have been working and continue to work to expand capacity in existing sites. We're working with partners and CMOs to supplement capacity. And our strategy is, first and foremost, to have an internal build but then we supplement externally as needed. But we're also progressing with -- rapidly with our site in North -- the second site, North Carolina in Concord, which you recall we've announced last year. And that could potentially go live in terms of production in the second half of 2024, again, gradually. So we will see some relief of supply at the end of -- or towards the end of next year and then continue to grow from there. And as you know, this is -- these are not the only 2 nodes of capacity. We're also adding outside of incretin and for incretin, API capacity in Ireland as well as 2 large sites in Indiana. So we're expanding capacity broadly to support both the incretin portfolio but then the broader Lilly portfolio, and managing a broad set of networks outside of Lilly. So a complex manufacturing set of nodes that we're working towards. We'll comment on -- specifically on 2024 when we provide guidance in terms of what you should expect in revenue. But this is how you should think about the gradual increase in supply with both RTP, internal capacity elsewhere as well as CMOs. The additional presentation is meant to provide options for patients. And as we've said, we'll start launching outside the U.S. with these presentations will -- which should provide additional capacity as well. And as I stated earlier, the manufacturing facilities in line already exists within Lilly for, for example, the vial production. We have those facilities. We don't need to construct new ones. So that provides us with the option to start with these as early as the end of this year and then going into next year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nStephen Scala: How should we think about the MACE reduction powering in SURMOUNT MMO now that we have the SELECT results? SURMOUNT MMO likely won't be as robust given the population studied, but would Lilly consider a win something half of SELECT's 20% MACE reduction? Or would that be viewed as disappointing?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Steve. I'll hand over to Dan for that.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Steve, for your provocative question here. Actually, of course, we expect tirzepatide to show a very important benefit, I think, on the MMO study. There are several important differences as you're alluding to. I think for the most part, though, they run in the opposite direction as you're suggesting, which would indicate a potential for an even larger effect size for SURMOUNT MMO. The most important difference is the drug itself. Remember that tirzepatide is a GLP/GIP coagonist, and GIP has some very significant benefits on weight loss and metabolic health overall. We've seen that in a number of different trials and confirm that with some interesting experiments on GIP monotherapy as well. So given the properties of this drug, given the level of weight loss we've seen in previous trials, given the important effects on blood pressure, on lipid profiles and on other biomarkers that indicate lower cardiovascular risk, we should be very confident in the large effect size coming out of the MMO study. There are some differences in the population. Our study includes both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk population. We also have a different primary end point, although, of course, we have the MACE as a secondary end point. Our primary includes 2 other events related to cardiovascular risk. Other than that, I would say that many of the patient characteristics are going to be quite similar. Our study is obviously much earlier. And as an event-driven study, it's going to take some time to read out. I think you were also asking about what would be considered a victory here, and I think we'll just sort of wait and see the data and understand it as it comes but no reason to expect anything less than what we're seeing today.\nOperator: Next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore.\nUmer Raffat: I wanted to zoom in on orforglipron and specifically on the case of liver enzymes, above 5x and a case above 10x as well as the treatment-emergent hepatobiliary disorders. I know the slides mentioned safety was similar to other incretins. And my question is, is your opinion on liver safety driven by the fact that these liver enzymes self-resolved? Or is it some preclinical data like the GSS ad hoc formation, et cetera?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Umer, for the question. I'll hand over to Dan for that question on orforglipron liver dynamics.\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, thanks for the question. Of course, there's been more attention on liver safety for orforglipron following the competitor announcement from Pfizer on 1 of their 2 oral GLP-1s. So we don't see any read-through from that. But of course, we've looked very carefully at liver safety. Maybe just starting at a high level, if you look at the supplementary data from the journal publication or you can see in the obese population that in terms of group averages, there's actually an improvement on liver enzymes with treatment of orforglipron. That's not surprising. We know that disease obesity is characterized in many patients by excess liver fat, which can cause inflammation and liver abnormalities. And when you reverse that, you see an improvement in liver function. Of course, when people come off the drug, they could get fat in their liver again and liver enzymes could go up. What we saw in this trial were a couple of patients scattered across arms, including placebo with excursions and liver enzymes, as you point out to -- I think there was one patient, with a bit of a higher excursion in liver enzymes on orforglipron that returned to normal levels while maintaining on therapy. That's generally not a pattern that we see in drugs that cause liver injury. But surely in Phase III, we'll keep an eye open for all possible safety consequences. I think I frequently caution investors on all of our molecules that Phase III is really the place where you can get surprised by any new safety findings. So we'll be watching liver safety closely, but not with any particularly heightened concern versus other adverse events that we'll also be watching carefully. This is a new molecule. This is the first time that we're exposing large, large numbers of patients to it for many years -- or many, many months, I should say, and we'll be monitoring safety carefully.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Risinger from Leerink Partners.\nDavid Risinger: So my question is for Dan, please. How are you thinking about whether future orthogonal mechanism weight-loss drugs can deliver the cardiovascular outcomes of incretins even if they match weight loss on a pound-for-pound basis?\nJoe Fletcher: Dan?\nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, David. It's a very good question, of course, particularly today. We think we understand how the biomarkers from incretin therapy translate into cardiovascular benefits. Some of those biomarkers should be translatable to other mechanisms. But depending on how orthogonal those other mechanisms are, there could still be some uncertainty. One, I think, important understanding, though, is that obesity itself, including, I think, particularly where the fat is deposited in the body, so for example, virtual fat, particularly, is -- contributes to adverse health outcomes, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes. And therefore, reversing that should provide cardiovascular benefits across mechanisms. But obviously, when we get to orthogonal mechanisms, each one will need its own data to demonstrate that. Recently, our focus has been on mechanisms that could stack on top of incretin therapy to give additional benefits in which case there could be a good read-through from the incretin trough. Thanks, David.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani: Trulicity and Mounjaro, can you talk a little bit about the dynamics there? In particular, are you seeing switching? Just trying to get a sense for how you're seeing the supply and then the revenue dynamic.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Mike to talk about Trulicity and Mounjaro, and any switching dynamics or observations we have. Mike?\nMichael Mason: Yes. No, good question. Obviously, it's something we've taken a look at since the launch. Really haven't seen any trend breaks in what we've seen and how much of Trulicity is being converted over to Mounjaro. We've seen about 13% to 14% of patients coming on to Mounjaro come on from Trulicity. So really no changes from what we've seen at launch. Overall, our goal is to grow the entire Lilly incretin franchise, and we did that well in Q2 by growing revenue by over 58%. So we're pleased where we're at with the -- with our Lilly incretin pipeline, our portfolio, and are excited to grow it further in quarters to come.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal: Congrats. I have a comment and a question, a comment from an associate that Lilly needs to have two calls, one for Mounjaro and one for everything else. So my question is -- the question is basically, how should we think about long-term supply now that the success of CV trial would likely spur more demand here? I know in the past, you talked about double of Trulicity eventually, but how should we think about the eventual supply of Mounjaro and Trulicity combined?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mohit. We'll take your comment under advisement. It's a fair point. To your question on long-term supply, I'll maybe hand back to Anat to talk a little bit more about manufacturing dynamics and plans.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Yes. So Mohit, I would echo a few of the things I said earlier. I outlined the expansion we are going to be seeing in our manufacturing footprint across our portfolio. So it's not just to support the incretin portfolio. But certainly with the RTP site in North Carolina and Concord, they're both for -- to support our incretin portfolio. They're both large sites. We did not provide the specific quantities, but we said that once RTP comes online by the end of the year, we expect to double capacity from where we were last year. So just use that kind of as a reference point. Trulicity and Mounjaro as you know are -- both utilize the same auto-injector. So they run on the same platform. And these lines are interchangeable, which allows us to manage production plans across our sites based on where we want or need to produce a product or market demand, et cetera. So we're going to be expanding our internal footprint to support the incretin portfolio as well as continue to leverage external partners to supplement that capacity.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO.\nEvan Seigerman: I'm going to ask one on donanemab to shake it up a little bit. So in submitting for donanemab full approval, are there any nuances that you needed to discuss with the agency following the CRL earlier this year? Or does FDA have everything that they need based on the data that we saw last month?\nAnne White: So much for the question on donanemab. And just to refresh Evan's memory, we have submitted accelerated approval submission, which was designated as a priority review. We did receive a CRL just based really on wanting more exposure. So it's a pretty simple request. Our resubmission with TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, the Phase III study, which certainly fulfilled any expectations on the CRL. And those good news, I think going through the accelerated approval, the FDA had the chance to review all of the aspects of the submission, preclinical manufacturing and others. So I would say we feel pretty confident at this point about the quality of our submission. And they've accepted that. They're reviewing it for traditional approval. So as we've said, we expect action by the end of the year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Robyn Karnauskas from Truist Securities.\nRobyn Karnauskas: I guess I have a big-picture question. So you're in payer discussions right now ahead of approval for weight loss from Mounjaro. For those payers that are not willing to cover, not on the fence, what do they need to see as you expect the cadence of supply versus access to shift in 5 years? Can you give us a sense of what that looks like and what they really need to see?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Robyn. I'll hand over to Mike. It sounds like the question is more around kind of payer discussions longer term and for those that are more maybe reticent, what might eventually move some of these payers. Mike, do you want to comment?\nMichael Mason: Yes. I think there's a couple of dynamics that will play out. I mean, first of all, we need to build a long-term clinical and real-world evidence to support payers' decisions, and we're doing that. We're spending literally billions of dollars in clinical evidence to show what tirzepatide and our pipeline can offer patients who have obesity and payers with regards to medical cost savings. We're confident in our modeling that payers will see medical cost offset with tirzepatide. And so I think that will be an important piece of it. I think the other dynamic is a lot of times, we focus on the clinical story. But there is things beyond the economic analysis that I think will play a role. If you go and really discuss with people who live with obesity, improving their health is a top personal goal. Sadly, when we look at the data, 82% people live with obesity experience physical functioning reductions, while 77% experience reduced mental, emotional well-being. Patients using tirzepatide showed significant improvements in physical, mental and emotional well-being in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And it's clear from the patient testimonies that we had in our SURMOUNT clinical trials that tirzepatide can meaningfully improve the lives of people with obesity. The massive interest that we see in obesity medications is really driven by the fundamental desire for people living with obesity to improve their health. People live with obesity should have a loud and powerful voice in this debate. And I think that's going to be a big component of payer decisions, whether that be an employer or be state or federal government. And so I think what you're going to see is over time, you're going to see data like the SELECT data, data like MMO or other clinical trials, continuing to build the case on economic side for these. While you're going to see the voice of people living with obesity who really want a better life, more hope for the future, who will be demanding access for these agents. And I think both over time, we'll continue to build access across the U.S. as well as globally.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Andrew Baum from Citi.\nAndrew Baum: A non-Mounjaro and non-donanemab question coming up. We estimate there's about $2 billion of Dupixent in the U.S. from adults with atopic dermatitis. When you are thinking about the launch of lebrikizumab, given the relatively little clinical differentiation, and therefore, the need to displace the Dupixent, could you just comment on how you're thinking about the launch? I'm assuming similar to Wegovy or [indiscernible] to some similar to Mounjaro or [indiscernible], the obvious thing would be to launch a very, very large bridge program in order to secure formulary access, tapping into that high-deductible patient population. Just interested in your thoughts here, please.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Andrew, for diversifying the question set. I'll hand over to Patrik, President of Lilly Immunology, to weigh in on lebrikizumab and how we're thinking about positioning. Patrik?\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much for the question on lebrikizumab. Now based upon the data we have seen, we realized it's not a head-to-head, but we're extremely encouraged by the maintenance data, having more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at week 16 and maintaining it at week 52. We really believe that we are positioned to launch a first-line biologic that actually has less frequent dosing than Dupixent. So that's a big differentiator and targeting the most relevant cytokine for atopic dermatitis, being IL-13 with a slow rate and high potency. From an access perspective, we see we have atopic dermatitis market growing significantly. And we know that payers are looking forward to options here. So we are believing but PBMs are willing to enter into discussions to enable a rapid access of lebrikizumab. And of course, here, we can capitalize on the strong footprint we have in dermatology and the portfolio we currently have in immunology. And our strategy will entirely focus on value and the differentiation with our medicine and what it brings to the marketplace for atopic dermatitis.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Carter Gould from Barclays.\nCarter Gould: I appreciate all the color on the manufacturing side. At the same time, Anat, a lot of those sites you talked about, those were sort of in your plans to start the year. So I guess my question is, as we think about sort of the derisking of orforglipron, the move to Phase III, has that in any way changed your sort of expected build-out for your longer-term manufacturing needs and really on the peptide side of the incretin side?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Carter. Great question. I think Dave wants to maybe jump in on this one.\nDavid Ricks: Yes. Sure. I'll jump in. I mean, just as we think about this over the long term, first of all, versus where we started the year, there is one change we're talking about today, which are these new presentations that we'll be launching beginning even this year into next year. It's important for people to know that the constraint we experience now is in the parenteral auto-injector space. So to the degree we move outside of that, using our multi-dose pen that's currently developed for insulin and we're redeveloping for tirzepatide or certainly the vial, which is quite accessible and high-volume systems available, we'll be able to make more than we had planned previously, just to be clear. That's on top of sort of an on-schedule expansion at RTP in the other North Carolina site as well as other internal nodes of capacity. So I think that's good news for Mounjaro. That all said, for the prior questions here, will that be enough to meet demand? I'm not so sure. So while the volume is moving up into the right, we need more. And does like today's news, will only expand the opportunity. So you're right to point out that other molecules, in orforglipron in particular, could play a big role in meeting global demand for obesity treatment and all the related complications because it's a completely different technology in that it's using oral solid, and there's quite a bit of capacity around the globe for that. Orforglipron is a complicated molecule to make. It's got many steps. But it puts us in using a different set of assets and processes than the current ones we're using. So that's an important program, particularly for global access and availability over the long term. Just to remember as well, 2 years ago, we were probably treating 10 million people globally with incretins. And the WHO is estimating there'll be 1 billion people with obesity and related conditions by 2050, I believe. So a long way away from getting all the way to that. We need things like orforglipron to work for us to meet the needs of all the patients in the world.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Trung Huynh from Credit Suisse.\nTrung Huynh: Just one on IRA. So one of the components that's been implemented in the part -- is the Part D redesign that starts impacting in '24, and then there's going to be some more meaningful changes in '25. On our calculations, we think it should benefit products under $25,000 a year, like your GLP-1 portfolio, but a negative for drugs priced above $25,000 a year. So given the mix of products you have in your portfolio at various different price points, directionally, how do you see that impacting earnings in the next few years?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Trung. I'm going to hand to Anat for that comment -- for that response on the IRA and potential impacts.\nAnat Ashkenazi: Yes. So if we -- I think you were referring to the Part D redesign associated with removing the coverage gap, but I'll also mention the negotiation. I wouldn't necessarily look at what the dollar amount is. But rather, you're right, there are going to be varying degrees of impact on products based on how quickly they move through the catastrophic phase. So just to give an example from Lilly. If you're thinking about an oncology product where patients get to the catastrophic phase very quickly, there is probably an additional cost associated with that for us moving from the previous 70% coverage gap to the 10% participation in the initial phase and then 20% in the catastrophic phase. For other indications, it might be the opposite. So there is a mix there. But then important to think about the fact that given that patients are now going to have a limit of out-of-pocket when they get to the pharmacy counter, hopefully, that should improve adherence and compliance to medications, which should drive, obviously, better health outcomes for these patients, but also as we're thinking about medication kind of adherence. So there's going to be some pushes and pulls of that part of the IRA. The more significant one that I would refer to is the so-called negotiation that we have as part of that, that's going to come later in 2026 and 2028 with the first cohort of products to be announced this year. I think that could have quite a meaningful impact on the drugs that are going to be negotiated in terms of the price discounts that the government is going to arrive at as part of that process.\nOperator: The last question is a follow-up from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford: Just a quick one on Verzenio. Just interested to see whether you can tender from a proportion of those drug sales now are represented by use in the early breast cancer setting. And given we've now seen the Kisqali NATALEE data at ASCO, just interested to hear how you're thinking about competition coming into that space?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry. All right, I'm going to hand over to Jake for that last question on Verzenio and the proportion of sales in early breast versus metastatic and maybe some commentary on NATALEE. Jake?\nJake Van Naarden: Yes. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the proportion of sales really on new patients or NBRx. TRx is sort of a lagging indicator, of course, that takes into account iterations of therapy. But what we're seeing on the NBRx side is about, call it, between 30% and 45% of prescriptions are in early breast cancer versus metastatic. And obviously, that number bounces around sort of week-to-week, month-to-month. So that's more or less in line with what we expected. So that's what's happening there. On the competitive dynamics in the adjuvant setting, now that we've seen the NATALEE data from Kisqali at ASCO, which by the way, were not really surprising to us, I think when you take a step back, and this is sort of both our opinion as well as what we've heard from thought leaders, we just really don't see what the Kisqali 3-year regimen is giving to patients to justify the additional year of therapy relative to the 2-year regimen that we've offered patients with Verzenio. Obviously, cross-trial comparisons notwithstanding, if anything, you see a marginally larger effect size with the 2-year Verzenio regimen in high-risk patients, obviously, the NATALEE study studied a larger population. The node-negative patients are at lower risk and frankly, not part of our indication. We didn't study those patients. I think to the extent that folks want to use Kisqali there, that's not really our business. Maybe it could be beneficial for those patients, I can't really say. I think the other thing, and Dan mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is that there's been a lot of talk in the past, of course, about the differences in the tolerability of these two agents. And I think one of the things that perhaps was somewhat surprising in the data we saw at ASCO with the high rate of discontinuations for toxicity of Kisqali, especially with many patients still on therapy. So that number, of course, will go up with more follow-up. So I think these 2 drugs, while they have different tolerability profiles in terms of what the side effects are, they actually have somewhat similar overall tolerance profiles. And importantly, the Verzenio tolerability can actually be managed with dose reductions without sacrificing efficacy. It's not clear that the same is true for Kisqali given the nature of those adverse events. So we continue to feel really good about what Verzenio can offer to patients and its competitive profile in the marketplace, and that's been validated by -- in talks with prescribing physicians. So we continue to feel good, and we just got to make sure that all the patients who can benefit from the medicine know that it's out there for them.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Jake. Dave?\nDavid Ricks: Great. Well, we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in the company. It's been a very productive first half of the year for Lilly, and we look forward to continuing our momentum into the second half. Thanks again for dialing in. And as always, please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on today's call. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. I'll focus my comments today on non-GAAP performance. In Q2, revenue increased 28% versus Q2 of 2022. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from COVID-19 antibodies in the base period, revenue increased 22% or 23% on a constant currency basis. This acceleration on revenue growth was achieved despite lingering headwinds from Alimta's loss of exclusivity in the United States, which occurred in the first half of last year, and the effects of which should normalize going forward. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was flat in Q2 at 79.8%. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from product mix, including onetime revenue from the sales of rights to Baqsimi, which was offset by increases in manufacturing expenses related to labor costs and our investments in capacity expansion. Total operating expenses increased 14% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 18%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming new product launches and additional indications. R&D expenses increased 32%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research.  This quarter, we recognized acquired IPR&D charges of $97 million or $0.09 of EPS. In Q2 2022, acquired IPR&D charges totaled $440 million or $0.46 of EPS. Operating income increased 69% in Q2 driven by higher revenue, including revenue associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi and lower IPR&D charges, partially offset by higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 27% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 115 basis points attributable to acquired IPR&D charges.  Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.1%. This represents an increase of 190 basis points compared to the same period in 2022 driven by the impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime in the sales of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $2.11 in Q2, a 69% increase versus Q2 of 2022, inclusive of $0.43 of EPS associated with the sales of rights for Baqsimi.  On Slide 8, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue increased 41%. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi, U.S. revenue grew 30% driven by robust growth from Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. Net price in the U.S. increased 2% for the quarter driven by Mounjaro access and savings cards dynamics. Excluding Mounjaro, net price in the U.S. decreased by low single digits, consistent with prior trends.  As I mentioned in our Q1 earnings call, we expect Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics to have an even greater effect on reported U.S. price changes in the second half of this year.  Europe continued its growth trajectory with revenue in Q2 up 6% in constant currency driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 12% in the second quarter. For Japan, Q2 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as we continue to see robust growth in our newer medicine, led by Verzenio, and to a lesser extent, Jardiance, Olumiant and Mounjaro, the last of which launched in Japan in April.  Moving to China. Revenue increased 20% in constant currency with volume growth only minimally offset by price declines. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Tyvyt and Verzenio. We are pleased to see our China business return to growth. Revenue in the rest of the world increased 19% in constant currency as volume growth of 20% was driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance.  Slide 9 shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As you may recall on our Q1 earnings call, we simplified the categorization of our products with a focus on 2 categories: new products and growth products. As you can see, the new and growth categories combined contributed 26 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter. The volume growth for all others category was driven by the sale of rights to Baqsimi. The lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies compared to the base period was a milder headwind to growth in Q2 compared to Q1 and will continue to be a modest impact to prior year comparisons.  Slide 10 provides additional perspectives across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 57% in Q2 as OUS volume grew 82%, while U.S. volume grew 47%. Jardiance also continued its strong performance with worldwide sales growth of 45% for the quarter.  There have been 2 notable regulatory approval for Jardiance in the last 2 months. In June, the FDA approved Jardiance for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in children 10 years and older, making Jardiance the first and only SGLT2 inhibitor approved for this patient population. And in late July, Jardiance was approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with chronic kidney disease. After almost a decade on the market, Jardiance continues to demonstrate its importance to patients across a number of cardiorenal metabolic conditions.  Trulicity performance has held up well in a growing and dynamic incretin market. In Q2, we saw worldwide Trulicity revenue decline by 5% as modest volume growth was more than offset by price erosion. In international markets, Trulicity volume continues to be affected by measures we have taken to minimize potential disruption to existing patients, including communications to health care professionals not to initiate patients on Trulicity. We remain confident that Trulicity will continue to be an important option for HCPs and patients in years to come.  Moving to Slide 11. I will share some perspective on Mounjaro's performance. We continue to be pleased with the strong momentum of Mounjaro as more type 2 diabetes patients benefit from the medicine. Mounjaro's revenue in the U.S. grew to $960 million for the quarter. In Q2, we continued to make progress in expanding access to Mounjaro, and access reached 73% on July 1 for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts from Mounjaro in Q2 was approximately 67%, up from approximately 55% in Q1.  As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescriptions outside of the $25 noncovered co-pay card but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Since the $25 noncovered co-pay card program expired in June 30, we would expect the proportion of paid script next quarter to be 100% under this definition.  Looking forward to the rest of the year, we expect continued growth in new-to-brand prescription as well as ongoing improvement in access.  Lastly, regarding the demand and supply outlook for incretin. We're pleased that commercial production has started at our RTP site in North Carolina. Even as we ramp up capacity at RTP, we believe supply will likely remain tight in the coming months and quarters due to significant demand.  Given the expected global demand for tirzepatide, as we mentioned on previous earnings call, we are moving forward with different presentations to bring tirzepatide to more patients faster. To this end, we initiated a bioequivalent study in early April for a multi-dose quick pen device. In many OUS markets, we expect to launch tirzepatide first in valve form later this year and transition to a multi-dose quick pen as approved and available in these markets starting in 2024. The launch of the valve and quick pen presentations for tirzepatide will leverage existing manufacturing assets and capacity. We're excited about the opportunity to expand the number of people we can help in the short term and long term with these additional options.  On Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. In the first 6 months of 2023, we invested $5.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, capital investments and business development outlays. In addition, we returned nearly $2.8 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.  Slide 3 presents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Given the strong performance in our underlying business as well as revenue from the sales of rights for Baqsimi and olanzapine, we are increasing our 2023 revenue guidance by $2.2 billion to a range of $33.4 billion to $33.9 billion. Approximately $1.5 billion of this increase is driven by business development activities, including the sales of rights for the olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi, while the remainder reflects strong underlying business performance.  Our updated FX assumptions based on recent spot rates are listed and represents a de minimis impact to the updated guidance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue has increased to approximately 80% driven by the sales of rights for Baqsimi and our olanzapine portfolio.  We're also increasing the range of operating expense guidance for the year. Marketing, selling and administrative costs are now expected to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion with the increase driven by additional investments in recent launches in preparation for launches of new medicine and line extensions expected later this year.  The range for research and development expenses has been increased to $8.9 billion to $9.1 billion, reflecting positive dynamics across our portfolio, including success in events in our early-stage assets, positive enrollment trends in our late-stage studies, broadening of the clinical program for next-generation incretin, and expected incremental expenses from business development activities.  We have incorporated IPR&D charges that have been incurred through Q2 2023, which totaled $202 million. Other income and expense and tax rate guidance have also been updated. OID is now expected to be between $0 million and $100 million in income, up from prior guidance of $100 million to $200 million in expense. We've also increased our estimated effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, up from approximately 13%, reflecting the impact of the sales of rights for our olanzapine portfolio and Baqsimi.  Based on these changes, we have raised our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $9.20 to $9.40 per share and raised our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $9.70 to $9.90.  Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D. Thanks, Kerry, for the questions. So we have raised, you're right, both SG&A guidance as well as R&D. The SG&A increases are primarily as a result of continued investment in the upcoming launches we have yet this year. As we're seeing the opportunities, we're excited to divest efficiently behind these opportunities and make them a reality for patients and for Lilly. On the R&D side, Dan provided a robust outline of the progress we've seen in our pipeline. And there are really, I would say, 3 to 4 key drivers of that increase. One is additional new studies that we've announced primarily in Phase III. And you mean the broadening of the investments we're making in our incretin portfolio, initiating multiple Phase III studies for both orforglipron and retatrutide and announcing new studies, coupled with continued advancement. We're seeing great success in our early-stage pipeline and we're investing behind that. We're also seeing continued success in our enrollment rates for currently for our Phase III program. So that's continued to enroll well. And then the 3 business development transactions, the inbound that we've announced, are now going to be incorporated in our second half R&D run rate. So all these combined are the drivers of the increase this year. So they represent really a tremendous opportunity for continued investments in a very successful pipeline. Colin, so let me first start with the end of your question on -- just to clarify RTP. So RTP is now live and producing for commercial purposes, and it's on line, in line with our expectations. So there are no delays. It's progressing as we had expected. I'm incredibly proud of the work that the manufacturing team have done to get us to this point. As Mike alluded, there will be a gradual increase in available capacity coming out of that site. We've mentioned in the past, it's a large site with multiple lines. They'll come online gradually and provide more products into the marketplace. As we think about 2024, I suggest we step back and look comprehensively at our manufacturing agenda and capacity plans. So RTP is one side. It's obviously of high interest just because of the proximal nature, and that's the first one that's launched out of the number of sites we have under construction. In parallel, we have been working and continue to work to expand capacity in existing sites. We're working with partners and CMOs to supplement capacity. And our strategy is, first and foremost, to have an internal build but then we supplement externally as needed. But we're also progressing with -- rapidly with our site in North -- the second site, North Carolina in Concord, which you recall we've announced last year. And that could potentially go live in terms of production in the second half of 2024, again, gradually. So we will see some relief of supply at the end of -- or towards the end of next year and then continue to grow from there. And as you know, this is -- these are not the only 2 nodes of capacity. We're also adding outside of incretin and for incretin, API capacity in Ireland as well as 2 large sites in Indiana. So we're expanding capacity broadly to support both the incretin portfolio but then the broader Lilly portfolio, and managing a broad set of networks outside of Lilly. So a complex manufacturing set of nodes that we're working towards. We'll comment on -- specifically on 2024 when we provide guidance in terms of what you should expect in revenue. But this is how you should think about the gradual increase in supply with both RTP, internal capacity elsewhere as well as CMOs. The additional presentation is meant to provide options for patients. And as we've said, we'll start launching outside the U.S. with these presentations will -- which should provide additional capacity as well. And as I stated earlier, the manufacturing facilities in line already exists within Lilly for, for example, the vial production. We have those facilities. We don't need to construct new ones. So that provides us with the option to start with these as early as the end of this year and then going into next year. Yes. So Mohit, I would echo a few of the things I said earlier. I outlined the expansion we are going to be seeing in our manufacturing footprint across our portfolio. So it's not just to support the incretin portfolio. But certainly with the RTP site in North Carolina and Concord, they're both for -- to support our incretin portfolio. They're both large sites. We did not provide the specific quantities, but we said that once RTP comes online by the end of the year, we expect to double capacity from where we were last year. So just use that kind of as a reference point. Trulicity and Mounjaro as you know are -- both utilize the same auto-injector. So they run on the same platform. And these lines are interchangeable, which allows us to manage production plans across our sites based on where we want or need to produce a product or market demand, et cetera. So we're going to be expanding our internal footprint to support the incretin portfolio as well as continue to leverage external partners to supplement that capacity. Yes. So if we -- I think you were referring to the Part D redesign associated with removing the coverage gap, but I'll also mention the negotiation. I wouldn't necessarily look at what the dollar amount is. But rather, you're right, there are going to be varying degrees of impact on products based on how quickly they move through the catastrophic phase. So just to give an example from Lilly. If you're thinking about an oncology product where patients get to the catastrophic phase very quickly, there is probably an additional cost associated with that for us moving from the previous 70% coverage gap to the 10% participation in the initial phase and then 20% in the catastrophic phase. For other indications, it might be the opposite. So there is a mix there. But then important to think about the fact that given that patients are now going to have a limit of out-of-pocket when they get to the pharmacy counter, hopefully, that should improve adherence and compliance to medications, which should drive, obviously, better health outcomes for these patients, but also as we're thinking about medication kind of adherence. So there's going to be some pushes and pulls of that part of the IRA. The more significant one that I would refer to is the so-called negotiation that we have as part of that, that's going to come later in 2026 and 2028 with the first cohort of products to be announced this year. I think that could have quite a meaningful impact on the drugs that are going to be negotiated in terms of the price discounts that the government is going to arrive at as part of that process."

We did receive a CRL just based really on wanting more exposure. So it's a pretty simple request. Our resubmission with TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2, the Phase III study, which certainly fulfilled any expectations on the CRL. And those good news, I think going through the accelerated approval, the FDA had the chance to review all of the aspects of the submission, preclinical manufacturing and others. So I would say we feel pretty confident at this point about the quality of our submission. And they've accepted that. They're reviewing it for traditional approval. So as we've said, we expect action by the end of the year."

            "content": "Thanks, Anat. It's been a productive and busy few months for Lilly R&D. Since our last earnings call, we've had a few major readouts across our therapeutic areas, and we've announced several business development transactions. Let me start with the data that we shared in June at the American Diabetes Association. We presented over 40 abstracts across our portfolio and shared data during 2 ADA-sponsored symposia. The first was for the Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-2 study of tirzepatide in adults with obesity or overweight in type 2 diabetes, which was simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. And the second symposium was for the results from 2 Phase II trials of retatrutide, our GIP/GLP glucagon tri-agonist in adults with obesity and overweight as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. The retatrutide results in obesity and type 2 diabetes were simultaneously published in New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet, respectively. We also shared an oral presentation on our Phase II trial results for orforglipron, our once-daily, non-peptide oral GLP-1 in adults with obesity or overweight. These results were simultaneously published in New England Journal. We also presented results from a Phase II trial of orforglipron in patients with type 2 diabetes, and these were published in the Lancet. Clearly, we're proud of all of this data in diabetes and obesity portfolio. Since we discussed the top line data for SURMOUNT-2 tirzepatide trial during our last earnings call, I'll focus my updates today on the Phase II data shared for orforglipron and retatrutide, starting with orforglipron on Slide 14. The orforglipron presentation highlighted safety and efficacy data across 6 dose arms in our Phase II study in obesity. With an overall mean body weight at baseline of 109 kilograms, orforglipron demonstrated an average of up to 14.7% body weight reduction at 36 weeks. At the second highest dose tested in the study, 75% of participants reached a weight reduction goal of 10% or more. We also shared data showing a dose-dependent decrease in systolic blood pressure and an overall improvement in lipid levels. The most common adverse events were GI-related and generally occurred earlier in the trial during the titration phase and were mostly mild to moderate. While we've not yet shared the dosing details for our Phase III studies, these Phase II results have informed our approach on dose escalation. We also presented data at ADA from a similar Phase II study of orforglipron in people with type 2 diabetes, the results of which are highlighted on Slide 15. Orforglipron demonstrated a mean reduction in hemoglobin A1c at 26 weeks of up to 2.1%, and over 90% of participants on the highest 3 doses achieved A1c levels less than 7%. We initiated Phase III trials for orforglipron in both obesity and type 2 diabetes in the second quarter, and we look forward to those results in 2025.  For retatrutide, the full results of 2 Phase II trials were presented during an ADA-sponsored symposium, which discussed efficacy and safety in adults with obesity or overweight with at least one weight-related comorbidity as well as in people with type 2 diabetes. There's also a segment of the symposium focused on liver fat and NASH-related biomarker data in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which showed relative liver fat reduction of over 80% at 24 weeks for the is doses. Slide 16 highlights key results from the obesity Phase II trial in which retatrutide met the primary end point at 24 weeks, demonstrating mean weight reduction up to 17.5%. The safety profile of retatrutide was similar to other incretin-based therapies. In a secondary end point of weight reduction at 48 weeks, participants treated with the highest dose of retatrutide demonstrated a mean rate -- weight reduction up to 24.2% or almost 58 pounds on average. If confirmed in registrational trials, we believe that magnitude of mean weight reduction would represent a new high watermark for weight loss from a pharmacologic agent at this time point. It's also worth noting that the Phase II retatrutide trial in obesity was well balanced between genders with females representing just under half of all participants in the trial. This was intentional and is atypical for incretin clinical trials in obesity, which often have a higher proportion of female participants, a subgroup that typically experiences greater weight loss than males. Indeed, in the retatrutide Phase II obesity trial, the mean change in body weight for female participants at the highest dose was 28.5%. Given these encouraging results, we moved rapidly to initiate the Triumph Phase III program, which will evaluate the safety and efficacy of retatrutide for chronic weight management, obstructive sleep apnea and knee osteoarthritis in people with overweight and obesity. These 4 Phase III trials will each run between 68 and 80 weeks. The trajectory of weight loss seen in the Phase II study reinforces our belief that retatrutide can potentially represent a further improvement and additional option for patients seeking pharmacological treatment for obesity and its complications. While retatrutide's Phase II results in obesity garnered much attention at ADA, the Phase II results in patients with type 2 diabetes are also very encouraging with participants receiving retatrutide achieving a hemoglobin A1c reduction of up to 2% on average in addition to meaningful levels of weight loss. I'm pleased to share that we plan to advance retatrutide into Phase III for type 2 diabetes. Moving to tirzepatide on Slide 17. We were delighted to announce in late July that SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 trials of tirzepatide in obesity met all primary and key secondary objectives. In key secondary objectives for both these studies, participants achieved similar mean weight reduction, 26.6% in SURMOUNT-3 and 26.0% in SURMOUNT-4. While these 2 trials were not required for our chronic weight management submission to the FDA, they provide important additional information regarding the role tirzepatide plays in maintaining or adding to the weight loss achieved with either intensive lifestyle intervention or pharmacotherapy in adults living with obesity or overweight. SURMOUNT-3 evaluated tirzepatide following an intensive lifestyle modification program and demonstrated that even in people who have a weight loss response to lifestyle intervention, tirzepatide provides significant additional weight loss. SURMOUNT-4 was a randomized withdrawal study in which all participants received tirzepatide for a 36-week lead-in period, at which point, half the participants were switched to placebo and the other half continued treatment with tirzepatide. This study demonstrated that those participants who continued on tirzepatide experienced continued weight loss, while those who switched to placebo started to regain weight. These data reinforce our understanding that obesity is a complex chronic disease for which multiple treatment approaches, including lifestyle modification and effective medications, are needed. We believe tirzepatide is well positioned to be one such treatment option. Accordingly, we submitted an application for tirzepatide for chronic weight management to the FDA during Q2. The FDA granted this application priority review designation, and we anticipate FDA action by year-end. Slide 18 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 4, and Slide 19 shows potential key events for the year. I've covered the major updates in diabetes, including the advancement of orforglipron and retatrutide into Phase III since our learning -- last earnings call. Turning then to our neuroscience portfolio. 3 weeks ago with the AIC meeting in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we were excited to share the detailed results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 study, highlighting donanemab's robust efficacy profile across a number of new analyses that reinforce our belief in the medicine's ability to meaningfully slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, especially in patients earlier in disease progression. We cover the results in some detail during our AIC investor call so I won't cover that again, except to note that we submitted donanemab to the FDA and to the EMA for approval, and we look forward to FDA action before the end of this year. Shifting to oncology. Launch progress continues with Jaypirca and mantle cell lymphoma, and we are pleased to have the detailed chronic lymphocytic leukemia results from the BRUIN Phase I/II trial published in New England Journal in early July. Following the discussion with the FDA, we've now submitted an application for accelerated approval for Jaypirca in CLL patients previously treated with both a covalent BTK inhibitor and venetoclax based on the results from the BRUIN Phase I/II study. We expect FDA action by year-end. Also during the quarter, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for pirtobrutinib for patients with MCL. We continue to study pirtobrutinib in multiple Phase III trials and look forward to the results from the BRUIN 321 trial in CLL, which we now expect to see before the end of this year, and it has been added to our key events slide. In other oncology developments, at ASCO in June, we presented new data from the Verzenio monarchE trial in high-risk early breast cancer. For the first time, we showed data demonstrating the efficacy of the medicine in this setting is not compromised when patients undergo dose reductions. We believe that the ability to manage Verzenio's side effects while preserving efficacy could be very important to ensuring that patients complete their 2 years of therapy. This is an emerging part of Verzenio's differentiation in this class. We're also very excited about last week's announcement regarding the randomized trial of Retevmo in treatment-naive RET fusion-positive lung cancer. As we communicated in the press release, this randomized trial was declared successful on its primary end point of progression-free survival, the first time any targeted therapy in lung cancer has ever shown superiority to a PD-1 plus chemotherapy regimen. While we remain disappointed by the low levels of genomic profiling done at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, we're hopeful that these data will continue to advance the practice of genomic-driven medicine. We look forward to sharing the full results of the study at an upcoming medical meeting. In our earlier-stage oncology portfolio, the combination experiment of our KRAS G12C inhibitor with pembrolizumab continues to mature nicely. And we're now working to initiate Phase III trials in first-line G12C-mutated lung cancer in the next 6 to 9 months. More broadly, we're excited to see the overall progress of our oncology portfolio. In addition to last week's Retevmo announcement, we expect another 7 randomized trial readouts in 4 to 6 new first-in-human trials across small molecules and biologics in oncology over the next 12 months. With the acquisition of Loxo Oncology 4 years ago, we catalyzed a change in the strategy and direction of oncology at Lilly, and we're seeing the fruits of these efforts. Finally, in immunology, we have several updates related to mirikizumab. A Digestive Disease Week in May, we presented new analyses from the Phase III LUCENT-1 and LUCENT-2 studies, demonstrating that remission of key symptoms of ulcerative colitis, including bowel urgency, was associated with significant improvement in the quality-of-life assessment in adults with UC. In Q2, we launched mirikizumab marketed as Omvoh in Japan as a treatment for adults with moderately to severe active UC. In late May, we received approval for Onvio in the EU and have subsequently launched Omvoh in Germany and planned additional launches in the EU later this year. In the U.S., we've resubmitted our application to the FDA. We now expect regulatory action by the end of this year. For lebrikizumab, our IL-13 monoclonal antibody under regulatory review for atopic dermatitis, we presented a new secondary analysis at the Revolutionizing Atopic Dermatitis Conference in May. This post-hoc analysis demonstrated improvement or clearance of face or hand dermatitis in adult and adolescent patients treated with lebrikizumab. These are parts of the body that are highly visible and for which dermatitis can be particularly burdensome and stigmatizing. We expect regulatory action for lebrikizumab in both the U.S. and EU later this year. Together with Almirall, our development and commercialization partner in Europe, we look forward to potentially bringing this important medicine to patients who suffer from this chronic disease. Looking earlier in our immunology pipeline, we're pleased in May to have the detailed results from our Phase IIa study of peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis published in the New England Journal. These data were first presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting in late 2022 and represent the first clinical evidence that's stimulating the endogenous PD-1 inhibitory pathway could be an effective approach to treat rheumatologic disease. As you can see, Q2 was another productive quarter for Lilly R&D with important progress in each of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Steve, for your provocative question here. Actually, of course, we expect tirzepatide to show a very important benefit, I think, on the MMO study. There are several important differences as you're alluding to. I think for the most part, though, they run in the opposite direction as you're suggesting, which would indicate a potential for an even larger effect size for SURMOUNT MMO. The most important difference is the drug itself. Remember that tirzepatide is a GLP/GIP coagonist, and GIP has some very significant benefits on weight loss and metabolic health overall. We've seen that in a number of different trials and confirm that with some interesting experiments on GIP monotherapy as well. So given the properties of this drug, given the level of weight loss we've seen in previous trials, given the important effects on blood pressure, on lipid profiles and on other biomarkers that indicate lower cardiovascular risk, we should be very confident in the large effect size coming out of the MMO study. There are some differences in the population. Our study includes both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk population. We also have a different primary end point, although, of course, we have the MACE as a secondary end point. Our primary includes 2 other events related to cardiovascular risk. Other than that, I would say that many of the patient characteristics are going to be quite similar. Our study is obviously much earlier. And as an event-driven study, it's going to take some time to read out. I think you were also asking about what would be considered a victory here, and I think we'll just sort of wait and see the data and understand it as it comes but no reason to expect anything less than what we're seeing today. Yes, thanks for the question. Of course, there's been more attention on liver safety for orforglipron following the competitor announcement from Pfizer on 1 of their 2 oral GLP-1s. So we don't see any read-through from that. But of course, we've looked very carefully at liver safety. Maybe just starting at a high level, if you look at the supplementary data from the journal publication or you can see in the obese population that in terms of group averages, there's actually an improvement on liver enzymes with treatment of orforglipron. That's not surprising. We know that disease obesity is characterized in many patients by excess liver fat, which can cause inflammation and liver abnormalities. And when you reverse that, you see an improvement in liver function. Of course, when people come off the drug, they could get fat in their liver again and liver enzymes could go up. What we saw in this trial were a couple of patients scattered across arms, including placebo with excursions and liver enzymes, as you point out to -- I think there was one patient, with a bit of a higher excursion in liver enzymes on orforglipron that returned to normal levels while maintaining on therapy. That's generally not a pattern that we see in drugs that cause liver injury. But surely in Phase III, we'll keep an eye open for all possible safety consequences. I think I frequently caution investors on all of our molecules that Phase III is really the place where you can get surprised by any new safety findings. So we'll be watching liver safety closely, but not with any particularly heightened concern versus other adverse events that we'll also be watching carefully. This is a new molecule. This is the first time that we're exposing large, large numbers of patients to it for many years -- or many, many months, I should say, and we'll be monitoring safety carefully. Yes. Thanks, David. It's a very good question, of course, particularly today. We think we understand how the biomarkers from incretin therapy translate into cardiovascular benefits. Some of those biomarkers should be translatable to other mechanisms. But depending on how orthogonal those other mechanisms are, there could still be some uncertainty. One, I think, important understanding, though, is that obesity itself, including, I think, particularly where the fat is deposited in the body, so for example, virtual fat, particularly, is -- contributes to adverse health outcomes, including adverse cardiovascular outcomes. And therefore, reversing that should provide cardiovascular benefits across mechanisms. But obviously, when we get to orthogonal mechanisms, each one will need its own data to demonstrate that. Recently, our focus has been on mechanisms that could stack on top of incretin therapy to give additional benefits in which case there could be a good read-through from the incretin trough. Thanks, David."

            "name": "Michael Mason",
            "content": "Thanks, Louise. I assume we probably would get a question on the SELECT trial, and thanks for starting out the call with that. The SELECT trial read out as we expected. I think the results are great for the anti-obesity medication class. It should really support access for any payers who are on the fence of whether they should add anti-obesity medications or not. I think importantly, it should turn the conversation of the benefits of weight loss away from aesthetics and more toward the health benefit of people living with obesity. When you look overall, there are 236 obesity-related health complications. To name a few, obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes by 243%, coronary heart disease by 69%, hypertension by 113%, dyslipidemia by 74%. The overall cost of obesity-rated complications and comorbidities are massive, accounting for $370 billion in direct medical cost, over $1 trillion in indirect annual costs in the U.S. People living with obesity or overweight drive 2.7 greater health care costs than normal-weight individuals. The global health stakeholders really need to be moved beyond the debate and really move to action on the AOM class. With tirzepatide's potential to provide over 20% weight loss, it should provide great value for payers. We have a comprehensive real-world evidence plan and clinical plan to demonstrate tirzepatide's value, including our MMO OUTCOMES trial. Based on the SELECT trial results, we can't wait to see the results of tirzepatide/MMO study. We do believe that additional weight loss will matter. This is a fantastic day for people living with obesity. Now do I think most payers will adopt AOMs overnight because of SELECT trial? I don't think so. I think, as I said earlier, those who are on the fence, this will push them over. But I think it is an important milestone in a long-term goal to get broad access for anti-obesity medications. Okay. Geoff, thanks for your question. Right now, we only market Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. So the only end-market real-world persistency rates that we have are for Mounjaro in type 2 diabetes patients. What we do know is that people living with type 2 diabetes have had good experiences with Mounjaro. In the first launch, like at the first phase of launch before we've made savings card and experienced supply spot outages, type 2 diabetes patients to Mounjaro did have better persistency than Trulicity, which is important because Trulicity historically has had the best compliance in the diabetes market. So we're confident in the experiences that people who use Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes have. And we're excited to see what that will be for people living with product weight management when and if we get approved by the FDA. No, it's a good question. I don't think that will be the case. What we've seen is payers opt into the class, not a particular drug. So I don't think that will give them a differential impact within payer access. I think commercially, typically, health care professionals when they see results like this, it really helps the class more than any one individual product. Chris, thanks for those questions. Yes, we did make the change in the $25 savings, program did expire at the end of June 30. So anything that you see in IQVIA is post that change. And you'll see that volume of those individuals who were using an uncovered plan no longer in our trends. We were very happy with what we saw with Mounjaro-pay TRxes in the quarter as they grew nearly 60% in the quarter. As we go forward, we'll -- our manufacturing team is working on bringing on new capacity at North Carolina and then a few more areas. And as that production comes on and ramps up, we will see some benefit from that supply. I mean, ultimately, that will help build inventories up and help eliminate any spot outage that we see. In the short term, because we're seeing really unprecedented demand, we do still expect to see tight supply and some spot outages on Mounjaro through the end of the year. But I think ultimately as that manufacturing capacity ramps up, we will be out of the spot outages that we see. But in the next couple of months and quarters, I think we'll still see tightened [indiscernible]. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating all alternatives, and we'll announce our decision at approval. Yes. No, good question. Obviously, it's something we've taken a look at since the launch. Really haven't seen any trend breaks in what we've seen and how much of Trulicity is being converted over to Mounjaro. We've seen about 13% to 14% of patients coming on to Mounjaro come on from Trulicity. So really no changes from what we've seen at launch. Overall, our goal is to grow the entire Lilly incretin franchise, and we did that well in Q2 by growing revenue by over 58%. So we're pleased where we're at with the -- with our Lilly incretin pipeline, our portfolio, and are excited to grow it further in quarters to come. Yes. I think there's a couple of dynamics that will play out. I mean, first of all, we need to build a long-term clinical and real-world evidence to support payers' decisions, and we're doing that. We're spending literally billions of dollars in clinical evidence to show what tirzepatide and our pipeline can offer patients who have obesity and payers with regards to medical cost savings. We're confident in our modeling that payers will see medical cost offset with tirzepatide. And so I think that will be an important piece of it. I think the other dynamic is a lot of times, we focus on the clinical story. But there is things beyond the economic analysis that I think will play a role. If you go and really discuss with people who live with obesity, improving their health is a top personal goal. Sadly, when we look at the data, 82% people live with obesity experience physical functioning reductions, while 77% experience reduced mental, emotional well-being. Patients using tirzepatide showed significant improvements in physical, mental and emotional well-being in the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And it's clear from the patient testimonies that we had in our SURMOUNT clinical trials that tirzepatide can meaningfully improve the lives of people with obesity. The massive interest that we see in obesity medications is really driven by the fundamental desire for people living with obesity to improve their health. People live with obesity should have a loud and powerful voice in this debate. And I think that's going to be a big component of payer decisions, whether that be an employer or be state or federal government. And so I think what you're going to see is over time, you're going to see data like the SELECT data, data like MMO or other clinical trials, continuing to build the case on economic side for these. While you're going to see the voice of people living with obesity who really want a better life, more hope for the future, who will be demanding access for these agents. And I think both over time, we'll continue to build access across the U.S. as well as globally."

            "name": "Jake Van Naarden",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks for the question. So I'll answer the proportion of sales really on new patients or NBRx. TRx is sort of a lagging indicator, of course, that takes into account iterations of therapy. But what we're seeing on the NBRx side is about, call it, between 30% and 45% of prescriptions are in early breast cancer versus metastatic. And obviously, that number bounces around sort of week-to-week, month-to-month. So that's more or less in line with what we expected. So that's what's happening there. On the competitive dynamics in the adjuvant setting, now that we've seen the NATALEE data from Kisqali at ASCO, which by the way, were not really surprising to us, I think when you take a step back, and this is sort of both our opinion as well as what we've heard from thought leaders, we just really don't see what the Kisqali 3-year regimen is giving to patients to justify the additional year of therapy relative to the 2-year regimen that we've offered patients with Verzenio. Obviously, cross-trial comparisons notwithstanding, if anything, you see a marginally larger effect size with the 2-year Verzenio regimen in high-risk patients, obviously, the NATALEE study studied a larger population. The node-negative patients are at lower risk and frankly, not part of our indication. We didn't study those patients. I think to the extent that folks want to use Kisqali there, that's not really our business. Maybe it could be beneficial for those patients, I can't really say. I think the other thing, and Dan mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is that there's been a lot of talk in the past, of course, about the differences in the tolerability of these two agents. And I think one of the things that perhaps was somewhat surprising in the data we saw at ASCO with the high rate of discontinuations for toxicity of Kisqali, especially with many patients still on therapy. So that number, of course, will go up with more follow-up. So I think these 2 drugs, while they have different tolerability profiles in terms of what the side effects are, they actually have somewhat similar overall tolerance profiles. And importantly, the Verzenio tolerability can actually be managed with dose reductions without sacrificing efficacy. It's not clear that the same is true for Kisqali given the nature of those adverse events. So we continue to feel really good about what Verzenio can offer to patients and its competitive profile in the marketplace, and that's been validated by -- in talks with prescribing physicians. So we continue to feel good, and we just got to make sure that all the patients who can benefit from the medicine know that it's out there for them."

We advanced our R&D pipeline, progressed our ambitious manufacturing agenda and delivered strong financial results. Our business saw an acceleration of revenue growth driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. As base period headwinds from COVID-19 antibody revenue and Alimta's loss of exclusivity recede, we do expect strong growth to continue in the quarters ahead. Lilly has made substantial progress in advancing our pipeline of innovative medicines in recent years, but the past few months have been particularly noteworthy. In early May, we shared the top line results of the Phase III TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial, which showed donanemab treatment slowed clinical decline in Alzheimer's by 35%. While differences in enrollment criteria and study design make cross-trial comparisons difficult, this represents the greatest percentage cognitive slowing in a primary end point of any disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatment reported to date, and the only Phase II to Phase III replication to date. Three weeks ago at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Amsterdam and simultaneously published in JAMA, we shared the detailed results, including new analysis, which demonstrates the potential of even greater cognitive slowing in patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's disease. At the ADA scientific sessions in June, we shared positive Phase II data on 2 next-generation diabetes and obesity product candidates: orforglipron and retatrutide. And less than 2 weeks ago, we shared top line results from the SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 Phase III trials, which showed participants on tirzepatide following intensive lifestyle intervention or with continued tirzepatide treatment, achieved up to 26.6% mean weight loss. Dan will share more perspectives in his R&D update on these and other exciting areas of pipeline progress. Moving to our results. You can see on Slide 4 the continued progress made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Excluding revenue from Baqsimi and from the sales of COVID-19 antibodies in 2022, Q2 revenue grew 22% on 23% volume growth. Volume growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, which leads our new products category. That category also includes Jaypirca and now Omvoh, which saw its first sales in Japan in Q2 and launched in Germany in July. In the second quarter of this year, new products and growth products categories combined contributed approximately 26 percentage points of volume growth. These products, coupled with potential upcoming launches, solidify Lilly's strong growth profile through this decade. We've had several important pipeline updates since our Q1 earnings call. For mirikizumab, approval in the EU and resubmission of our U.S. application with regulatory action expected by the end of this year. Regulatory submissions in the U.S. for tirzepatide for chronic weight management; regulatory submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA following the positive Phase III results from the TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 2 trial; and positive Phase III top line readouts for SURMOUNT-3 and 4 in the third and fourth global studies evaluating tirzepatide in chronic weight management. The second quarter also was productive for business development. We've commented in the past on our active exploration and pursuit of external innovation and are pleased to have announced agreements to acquire 2 clinical-stage companies in the second quarter: DICE Therapeutics and Versanis Bio. These companies operate in different therapeutic areas, and each is a fit with Lilly's strategy. We also closed the sale of global rights to Baqsimi, and the financial impact of this transaction is reflected in our Q2 results. After quarter end, we closed the sale of rights to our olanzapine portfolio, which will be reflected in our Q3 financial results. Both these transactions are now incorporated into our updated 2023 financial guidance. We continued to progress the most ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda in the 147 history of our company. We're happy to share that commercial production to support our incretin portfolio has begun at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. Beyond the capacity expansion that will come as we ramp production at this site, we're also pursuing other near-term paths to expand access to our incretins to patients around the world. Anat will provide more detail on these efforts. And finally, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends this quarter. On Slide 5, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we're sharing today. So without further ado, I'll turn this over to Anat to share our Q2 results. Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. This quarter saw an acceleration of revenue growth as our recently launched product portfolio gathers momentum. Excluding COVID-19 antibodies and Baqsimi revenue, we grew 22% driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The quarter also saw a continuation of investment in our future growth in our manufacturing expansion, in late-stage medicines, in early phase capabilities and in business development. Notwithstanding these long-term investments, we continue to expect our revenue will grow more rapidly than our expense base in the coming years and see significant opportunity for margin expansion. We also achieved meaningful advances in our near-term pipeline with positive phase -- positive top line results, detailed data disclosures and submission of donanemab for traditional approval to the FDA and EMA, and completion of the tirzepatide submission in chronic weight management, alongside positive top line results from 2 more Phase III trials for the SURMOUNT program. We also shared data from 4 mid-stage clinical trials for orforglipron and retatrutide and initiated Phase III trials for both assets. Lastly, we announced several targeted business development moves intended to bolster our early- and mid-stage portfolio and our R&D capabilities, and we returned over $1 billion to shareholders via the dividend. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. Sure. I'll jump in. I mean, just as we think about this over the long term, first of all, versus where we started the year, there is one change we're talking about today, which are these new presentations that we'll be launching beginning even this year into next year. It's important for people to know that the constraint we experience now is in the parenteral auto-injector space. So to the degree we move outside of that, using our multi-dose pen that's currently developed for insulin and we're redeveloping for tirzepatide or certainly the vial, which is quite accessible and high-volume systems available, we'll be able to make more than we had planned previously, just to be clear. That's on top of sort of an on-schedule expansion at RTP in the other North Carolina site as well as other internal nodes of capacity. So I think that's good news for Mounjaro. That all said, for the prior questions here, will that be enough to meet demand? I'm not so sure. So while the volume is moving up into the right, we need more. And does like today's news, will only expand the opportunity. So you're right to point out that other molecules, in orforglipron in particular, could play a big role in meeting global demand for obesity treatment and all the related complications because it's a completely different technology in that it's using oral solid, and there's quite a bit of capacity around the globe for that. Orforglipron is a complicated molecule to make. It's got many steps. But it puts us in using a different set of assets and processes than the current ones we're using. So that's an important program, particularly for global access and availability over the long term. Just to remember as well, 2 years ago, we were probably treating 10 million people globally with incretins. And the WHO is estimating there'll be 1 billion people with obesity and related conditions by 2050, I believe. So a long way away from getting all the way to that. We need things like orforglipron to work for us to meet the needs of all the patients in the world. Great. Well, we appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in the company. It's been a very productive first half of the year for Lilly, and we look forward to continuing our momentum into the second half. Thanks again for dialing in. And as always, please follow up with the IR team if you have questions we have not addressed on today's call. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you very much for the question on lebrikizumab. Now based upon the data we have seen, we realized it's not a head-to-head, but we're extremely encouraged by the maintenance data, having more than 80% of patients achieving skin clearance at week 16 and maintaining it at week 52. We really believe that we are positioned to launch a first-line biologic that actually has less frequent dosing than Dupixent. So that's a big differentiator and targeting the most relevant cytokine for atopic dermatitis, being IL-13 with a slow rate and high potency. From an access perspective, we see we have atopic dermatitis market growing significantly. And we know that payers are looking forward to options here. So we are believing but PBMs are willing to enter into discussions to enable a rapid access of lebrikizumab. And of course, here, we can capitalize on the strong footprint we have in dermatology and the portfolio we currently have in immunology. And our strategy will entirely focus on value and the differentiation with our medicine and what it brings to the marketplace for atopic dermatitis."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher : Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific and Medical Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, CEO of Loxo at Lilly; Mike Mason, President of Lilly Diabetes; and Patrick Jonsson, President of Lilly Immunology and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Mike Springnether, Kendo Waha and Lauren Zierke of the Investor Relations team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide three. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Joe. We're off to a strong start in 2023 with volume-driven revenue growth led by our incretin portfolio, Verzenio and Jardiance. At our Q1 earnings last year, we shared exciting data from SURMOUNT-1, the first of our tirzepatide obesity Phase III trials. Today, we're excited to share the positive top line results for the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III trial for tirzepatide, which examine the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in chronic weight management in a type 2 diabetes population. SURMOUNT-1 set a new bar for weight loss possible from a pharmacologic agent in non-type 2 diabetes population with obesity or overweight in a Phase III trial. And SURMOUNT-2 does the same in the type 2 diabetes population. Before discussing our financial results and pipeline updates, I'd like to also note the actions Lilly announced on March 1 to improve insulin affordability in the United States. We are proud to have led these efforts to make it easier for people to access Lilly insulin, including through the broad implementation of our $35 out-of-pocket cap and a significant reduction in list price for most of our most commonly used insulins. That said, there remains substantial opportunity and need to reduce existing systemic barriers to insulin access and affordability. Bringing affordable insulin to those who need it will require action and engagement by all stakeholders in our health system. But together, we can create real change to improve access and affordability for people who use insulin. Moving to our results. You can see this on Slide 4 that the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue, which includes sales of COVID-19 antibodies -- sorry, excluding sales from COVID-19 antibodies grew 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth of 18%. Volume growth in Q1 was underpinned by Mounjaro, which is leading the new product category, which also includes Jaypirca, and we expect it will include additional products in the months and years to come. The new product and growth product classifications represent an evolution from our prior designation of key growth products. We believe that these classifications will help investors see the performance of both our newest products in addition to those with ongoing growth potential. In the first quarter of this year, the new product category contributed $574 million of revenue, and the new product and growth product categories combined to contribute 20 percentage points of volume growth in Q1. These products as well as expecting -- expected upcoming product launches reinforce our belief in the strength of Lilly's growth outlook throughout this decade. Last Monday, we broke ground at the site of our two new manufacturing facilities in Boone County, Indiana. We also announced a further $1.6 billion investment in addition to the previously announced $2.1 billion investment in this project to expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities. And our progress continues as planned towards production starting later this year at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. On the business development front, this past week, we entered into agreements to sell the rights of our olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa and the rights to These two transactions will enable us to further focus our time and effort on our next-generation medicines. In our pipeline, we've had several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including label expansion for Verzenio in advanced breast cancer in the U.S.; for mirikizumab approval in Japan and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as the FDA's issuance of a Complete Response Letter in the United States; regulatory submissions in the EU for tirzepatide for chronic weight management and in Japan for lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-2, the second global study evaluating tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight, which will enable completion of our rolling submission with the FDA under Fast Track designation. Dan will discuss this further, but we are excited with the top line results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-2 trial. As shared late last year, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and initiated a rolling submission for tirzepatide in chronic weight management based on the results of the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And we aligned with the FDA that completion of the submission would come following the SURMOUNT-2 readout. We anticipate completing our submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. We believe addressing obesity could make an enormous difference in millions of people's lives, significantly impact public health and reduce health care costs. We are encouraged by this important next step in the journey to redefine obesity care. Finally, this quarter, we distributed $1 billion in dividends and completed $750 million in share repurchases. On Slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we are discussing today. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 results.\nAnat Ashkenazi : Thanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 12.8%. This represents an increase of 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by the tax impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $1.62. On Slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 14%. As a reminder, COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q1 of 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion compared to zero in Q1 of this year. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 19%, driven by robust volume growth for Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. We experienced a net price decline of 5% in the U.S. for the quarter, driven primarily by Humalog and Trulicity. As we move into the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. pricing headwind versus prior year will ease considerably driven by Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics. Europe continued its steady growth trajectory with revenue in Q1 growing 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 13% in Q1. For Japan, Q1 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as the base period impact of generic competition to Cymbalta and Alimta waned, and we continue to see strong robust growth in our newer medicines led by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, Jardiance. Moving to China. Revenue declined 1% in constant currency with volume growth of 19% offset by net price declines. Volume growth was driven by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, increase in shipments of Olumiant. Price declines were largely driven by Humalog, which was added to the volume-based procurement scheme in Q2 of last year. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 9% in constant currency, driven by the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia for $95 million in Q1 of 2022, partially offset by growth in Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance. Slide eight shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As Dave mentioned earlier, we have evolved a prior product categorization from key growth products, which included 10 key products launched since 2014 to now focus on 2 categories, the first called new product and the second called growth product. The new product categories led by Mounjaro and also includes Jaypirca, and we expect to expand to include new products in the coming months and years. The growth product category is made up of select products that have been in the market for several years with continued exclusivity. As you can see, the new and growth product categories contributed over 20 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter, which was largely offset by the previously mentioned decline in COVID-19 antibody revenue. While the lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibody will be a headwind to growth throughout the year, the most substantial impact was in Q1. As I mentioned earlier, in Q1 2022, we realized approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, representing 75% of the $2 billion sold in the full year 2022. Slide 9 provides additional perspective on the trends and specific highlights across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 60% in Q1 as the long-term monarchE follow-up data shared at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December and the recently expanded label support continued uptake in adjuvant breast cancer. Verzenio is now the standard of care in its Category 1 NCCN listed for high-risk adjuvant breast cancer. Jardiance also continued its outstanding performance with worldwide sales growth of 38% for the quarter. In Q1, we were pleased to announce that based on the results of the Phase III DYNAMO trial, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance for children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. And lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of Trulicity's performance in a growing and dynamic incretin market. Worldwide sales of Trulicity grew 14% in Q1, anchored by the product's robust efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the convenient and easy-to-use device. Looking more holistically at Trulicity and Mounjaro together, U.S. revenue for these two products grew 59% in Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Moving to Slide 10. Let me share some commentary and context on Mounjaro's performance for the quarter. We are pleased with the positive momentum over the course of Q1 as it means more patients with type 2 diabetes are realizing the substantial benefits of treatment with Mounjaro. While the trajectory of prescription growth shifted following our actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients, we have continued to see a positive overall trend. Our focus is on driving new-to-brand growth while continuing to expand access. In Q1, we initiated our first Mounjaro direct-to-consumer TV campaign, and we continue to steadily build access from Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, access stood at just under 60% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts for Mounjaro in Q1 was just over 55%, up from approximately 40% in Q4 2022. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescription outside the $25 non-covered co-pay cards but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of the year, we expect continued improvement in access in the proportion of paid scripts and in new-to-brand prescription. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2023, we invested $2.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned just over $1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $700 million in stock. Slide 12 represents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the revenue guidance range by $900 million to now be in the range of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Since announcing our 2023 financial guidance in December, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies. We have updated our full year revenue outlook based on recent spot rates. This FX update is driving approximately $650 million of the $900 million increase in our revenue guidance. The remainder of the increase is attributable to underlying business performance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged. In terms of operating expenses, we are increasing the range of marketing, selling and administrative costs by $100 million to reflect our updated exchange rate assumptions. This results in an updated range of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. We are also increasing the range for research and development expenses by $100 million, driven by updated exchange rate assumptions and investments in our late-stage portfolio. This results in an updated R&D range of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. We have incorporated IP R&D charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of earnings, which totaled $105 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have not included any IP R&D charges associated with potential or pending business development transactions. Additionally, the recently announced agreements to sell the right of our linsepene portfolio and have not been included in guidance. Each transactions will be factored into our financial guidance after it closes. Other income and expenses and tax rate guidance remain unchanged. Based on these changes, we are raising our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $8.18 to $8.38 per share and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.85. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D.\nDaniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive results for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III study. Tirzepatide met the co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary endpoints. Participants with obesity or overweight and with type 2 diabetes achieved up to 16% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 34 pounds. Additionally, 86% of people taking 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved at least 5% body rate reduction. This was in line with our expectations based on our SURPASS-3 data in a similar population. With this SURMOUNT-2 data, we now have two positive Phase III trials for tirzepatide in obesity, 1 in patients without type 2 diabetes and 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes. We now look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. I'll cover the SURMOUNT-2 results in more detail, but first, let me spend a few minutes providing an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 8 studies. On Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for the core SURMOUNT-1 through four studies as well as the more recently announced SURMOUNT-MMO and SURMOUNT-5 studies. Five of the six studies compare efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity, while the most recently posted trial, SURMOUNT-5 compares tirzepatide to 2.4-milligram semaglutide. As a reminder, SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. And it delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2, which we're reporting today, evaluated treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program and SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. SURMOUNT-5 is an open-label trial that will enroll 700 adults who have obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities without type 2 diabetes and will compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide 2.4-milligrams. Finally, SURMOUNT-MMO is our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity. We expect the next two studies, SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 to read out later this year, while SURMOUNT-5 is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2025. SURMOUNT-MMO, as an outcome study, will take several more years to complete. On Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-2 study where tirzepatide 15-milligram delivered 15.7% mean body weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight. With a baseline weight across the study of 222 pounds, tirzepatide treatment led to a mean body weight reduction of 34 pounds on the 15-milligram arm of the study. We're also very pleased to see how well the 10-milligram tirzepatide performed with a 13.4% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimand. Results for the treatment regimen estimand were similar to the efficacy estimand and are detailed in this morning's SURMOUNT-2 press release. Moving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide achieved the second co-primary endpoint of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2 showed up to 86.4% of patients achieved this level of weight reduction at 72 weeks, again, using the efficacy estimand. This is compared to 30.6% of patients on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Furthermore, over half of all participants in the 15-milligram treatment arm achieved at least 15% weight loss. It has been previously observed in incretin obesity trials that weight loss in a type 2 diabetes population is less than weight loss seen in a non-type 2 diabetes population, a finding consistent with the results we've now reported from the SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2 trials. The average weight reductions reported in the SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes range from 7% to 8% less than those seen in SURMOUNT-1, which was an exclusively non-type 2 diabetes population. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may explain this effect, including the weight gain-promoting effects of some classes of anti-hyperglycemic medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide treatment, gender differences between 2 populations and diminished caloric loss effects of glucosuria. These differences manifested as we expected, and the SURMOUNT-2 top line results represent the most robust weight loss seen in a Phase III pharmacological clinical trial consisting entirely of type 2 diabetes patients with obesity or overweight, and we are highly pleased with these results. Moving to Slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in the study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for treatment of obesity. As in SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS program, the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related, were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred through dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 3.8% and 7.4% for the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms, respectively, compared to 3.8% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.3% and 13.8% in the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 14.9% for placebo. We look forward to sharing more data from SURMOUNT-2 at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and to submitting the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Obesity is a widespread and chronic disease in need of more effective treatment options. The FDA Fast Track designation that tirzepatide received for obesity reflects the seriousness of the condition and the substantial unmet medical need. With impressive trial results now in hand for SURMOUNT-2 and SURMOUNT-1 studies, we look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in the coming weeks. With respect to regulatory action in Europe, as Dave mentioned, we have already completed our submission to the EMA for chronic weight management indication. The EMA submission was initiated based on the results from the SURPASS trial program in type 2 diabetes and the SURMOUNT-1 Phase III trial in obesity. We expect to have a European Commission decision in the first half of 2024. In addition to all the work on tirzepatide for obesity, we also disclosed earlier this month on clinicaltrials.gov the initiation of a bioequivalent study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide administered using the existing auto-injector device and a new test device. We expect to work on tirzepatide and other injectable incretins for a long time. And we intend to explore different presentations for these medicines to meet our goal of bringing the benefits to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Moving on from tirzepatide to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24, and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. Continuing within diabetes and metabolic disease. Earlier this month, we began recruiting for the first Phase III clinical trial for orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist. This ACHIEVE-4 trial is an open-label study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased risk for cardiovascular events. This is the first in what will be a broader series of studies for orforglipron. It is the largest and longest trial in the program, which is why we chose to initiate this trial first. Enrollment is now underway and we expect patient dosing to recur shortly, after which orforglipron will be placed with our Phase III assets on the summary slide. You'll also see we have advanced our Relaxin long-acting molecule to Phase II development for treatment of heart failure. Shifting to immunology. It was a quarter of mixed progress for mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 inhibitor. We were pleased with the approval in late March in Japan for mirikizumab under the brand name for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. A few days later, we were similarly pleased with the positive CHMP opinion from the EMA. However, regarding mirikizumab's regulatory path in the United States, we announced earlier this month that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. The letter did not cite any concerns regarding the safety or efficacy profile of mirikizumab but focused exclusively on certain aspects related to the proposed commercial manufacturing of mirikizumab. We remain confident mirikizumab's Phase III data and its potential to help people with ulcerative colitis. We look forward to working with the FDA to address the manufacturing questions in order to achieve our goal of bringing mirikizumab to patients in the U.S. Also in our late phase immunology portfolio, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for lebrikizumab for patients with atopic dermatitis. Moving earlier in our immunology pipeline, during last month's American Academy of Dermatology meeting, we shared data from the single-dose Phase II trial for eltrecabart, our CXCR1/2 antibody in patients with hydroadonitis The data showed good tolerability and clear separation between eltrecabart and placebo, along with a reduction in abscesses and nodules, reflecting reduced disease activity. Lastly, in immunology, we've removed REsPEG-Aldis leukin from our pipeline. In February, following the top line data announcement from the Phase II study in systemic lupus , we informed our partner, Nektar Therapeutics that we do not intend to advance the asset into Phase III development. Moving on to neuroscience. Last month, we announced that our last active solanezumab trial, the antiamyloid in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease study or A4 study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The A4 study was conducted through an innovative public-private partnership, and we were thankful for the time and effort of the clinical study staff, participants and study partners. This study formally concludes our clinical development of solanezumab. The A4 results, while disappointing, were not a surprise, given the advancements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease since the study initiated almost 10 years ago. Solanezumab only targets soluble amyloid beta and does not clear plaque. Denenimab and rimternatug, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to bind to and clear amyloid plaque, and we now understand that substantial plaque clearance is required in order for anti-amyloid drugs to show clinical efficacy. Accordingly, we were pleased to share new data for duninimab and during the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in late March. For denetimab, we shared data from our Trailblazer EXT, a Phase II long-term follow-on study of Trailblazer ALS. While study limitations include a relatively small number of patients, the data showed encouraging trends and the longer-term effects on amyloid and tau levels and clinical progression. We also disclosed the trial design and objective for Trailblazer Phase IIIb study to expand the science and understanding of ARIA in relationship to amyloid lowering through imaging and blood-based biomarkers in different dosing paradigms. This study will leverage enhanced MRI sequences as well as blood-based biomarkers and other patient characteristics that may predict ARIA. And we'll investigate the effect of different dosing regimens on the frequency and severity of ARIA. Of course, we expect the next key milestone for genenumab will be later this quarter when we obtain the results for our confirmatory Phase III TRAILBLAZER ALS 2 trial. We look forward to sharing these results and to advancing the regulatory process for assuming positive data from this trial. This quarter, we also shared the first clinical data from [indiscernible] from a Phase I multiple ascending dose study, which highlighted the potential speed and depth of amyloid plaque lowering in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data on amyloid clearance, safety and tolerability supported our decision to move this asset into Phase III, and we look forward to sharing further updates as the program progresses. You'll also notice we have a number of developments in our early-stage neuroscience portfolio with a Phase II entry for our GBA1 gene therapy asset in the Gaucher disease type 1 indication along with 2 Phase I pain asset entries and 1 Phase II pain asset discontinuation. Shifting now to oncology. Just yesterday, Jaypirca received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Verzenio for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High-risk patients can now be more easily identified with the removal of the Ki-67 score requirement for patient selection. Moving earlier in our oncology pipeline, we presented data from our Phase I study of our KRASG12C inhibitor as part of the AACR meeting last week. These data show promising efficacy and the potential for a differentiated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab. We're working on finalizing dose selection for our drug in combination with pembrolizumab. And at AACR, we also showed data from CYCLONE 1, a single-arm unblinded study, which was the first to investigate Verzenio in prostate cancer. This early study informed the design of our CYCLONE 2 adaptive Phase II/III trial, which last year cleared our preset threshold to advance to Phase III and for which we expect to read out as soon as late this year. Q1 was another busy and productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDavid Ricks : Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress to start the year. Our core business, which excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, grew 10%, driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. This growth was achieved despite headwinds related to pricing, to generic erosion of Alimta in the U.S. and a moderated but still negative foreign exchange impacts. In the coming quarters, we expect the impact of COVID-19 antibody revenue in the prior periods will ebb, while our new product and growth product categories of medicines will drive continued revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. While the quarter was not without some challenges, which I am confident we'll overcome, we made meaningful advances in our pipeline, including the approval of an expanded label of Verzenio, the first approval of mirikizumab in Japan, submission of tirzepatide for obesity in the EU and positive results from our second Phase III trial for tirzepatide in obesity. We also demonstrated leadership to improve insulin access and affordability for millions of Americans. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to both executing on the significant opportunities before us and to continuing the important and often difficult work to discover, develop and bring to market innovative medicines to address some of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude the call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] We're going to end the call at 11:15 a.m. Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim.\nSeamus Fernandez : So question is for Dan. Dan, can you just give us your thoughts on, I guess, what many investors are sort of viewing as the potential Goldilocks scenario that would be necessary to really successfully compete with lucanumab. I'm sure you have your own thoughts on this that are quite detailed. So just wondering how you believe the sort of commercial opportunity and/or really the clinical opportunity is likely to play out once we see the data, assuming the study is positive.\nDaniel Skovronsky : Yes. Thanks, Seamus. I'll start sort of on the data expectations and how it might fit in and maybe Anne will add some things on commercial opportunity. So I think we had very compelling data in Phase II, 32% slowing of disease progression. If in Phase III, we can replicate those kinds of results, this will be a very important and meaningful drug. I know it's interesting for investors to sort of speculate on competition between 2 different pharma companies. It's not exactly how I think about it. I think there's a huge opportunity here for patients. The challenge is not really about competition. It's about how do we help the medical system better identify patients, diagnose them and move them into treatment regimens, of course, requiring reimbursement. I think the two drugs, however, have some important differences. Dunanumab targets specifically amyloid plaques. We think that's the relevant species to hit in Alzheimer's disease. I think we were pretty confident about that in the past, probably the solanezumab data, which targeted just soluble adds even more confidence to that statement. As a result of hitting just amyloid plaques, that allows us to have fixed duration dosing regimens as an option for patients. Let's see how the data turn out. But I expect that many patients will be able to stop dosing even as soon as 12 months. That's a big difference than being prescribed a drug that you might have to take the rest of your life. And I think that could be exciting and important for patients. So lots of ways for donanemab to win. I think the most important thing, though, is showing consistent strong efficacy like we did in Phase II and then getting this drug approved and bringing it to patients. Anne, what do you have?\nAnne White : Thanks, Dan. Yes, we do remain confident in the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab. And I think it's important to remember, it will take time to build this market. And so as Dan said, we're investing in these efforts now, building awareness of diagnostics, the awareness of treatments are coming, making sure that the health care systems are ready for these medicines and that the care pathway is set up, and then most importantly, as you said, that patients have access and reimbursement. And just to echo his comments, I don't think we really think of this as a cost of drugs we need to fight over market share. It's an opportunity to build a new class on behalf of disease, driving awareness, driving diagnosis and then getting access. So that's important to us in the near term.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley.\nTerence Flynn : Maybe two part for me. Just I know you're not going to give us a decision on whether you're going to split the tirzepatide brand in two here. But maybe you could just talk through some of the key considerations as you think about kind of access side, pricing, IRA, all those things as you just think about the puts and takes. And then on North Carolina manufacturing, just any update on time lines as to when we can expect that to come on board.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Terence. I'll go to Mike for those questions on branding strategy considerations and then any update on RTP.\nMichael Mason : All right. Thanks, Terence, for that question. On the branding question, obviously, yes, we're not going to provide any clarity on that. I think if you look at the kind of pros and cons on 1 versus 2 brands, the pros are, it is a more efficient supply chain and manufacturing for 1 brand, for 2 brands or some access benefits. Also, you have an empty vessel for the commercial promotion of our obesity indication with the 2-brand scenarios. So that's kind of the puts and takes on that part. On the supply, I think maybe I'll answer the overall supply question because I'm sure there may be other questions on there. We talked last year that our focus was to double capacity by the end of this year, and we're progressing toward that goal. Our manufacturing team is working hard every day and directly delivering over our manufacturing plan this year. We believe that our channel inventory for Q2 will be a bit better for what we saw in Q1. And obviously, as you bring up, the important milestone is us bringing our first [indiscernible] brand fully online this year. The manufacturing team is progressing toward that goal. And then long term, we're investing where we need to in order to create a long-term significant supply across our entire incretin portfolio to meet what we think is going to just be a tremendous demand globally for the product and for all our incretin portfolio.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.\nChristopher Schott : Just a 2-parter as well. Can you just maybe talk about bigger picture what you've been seeing in the incretin market? It seems like we first had this nice very strong ramp of Mounjaro, and then we saw a further step-up in category growth with NOVOS capacity issues being resolved. So I guess when you're seeing kind of the underlying demand that's out there, is that changing at all how you think about either investing in the space or just your go-to-market strategy for both Mounjaro and then tirzepatide obesity when that's approved? I'm just trying to get a sense of just are you -- I think we're all surprised by the volume trends, just how you're kind of adapting within Lilly to kind of think about that beyond just the capacity side, more of the investment side. And then the second question for me on Mounjaro is just can you give a quick update of where we stand right now in terms of use in diabetics versus nondiabetics, given the change in the Bridge program.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Chris, for the 2-parter there. Mike, we'll go to you for the first part around bigger picture in the incretin market and category growth and how we're thinking about that and then the second round, use in patients with diabetes versus none.\nMichael Mason : Okay. I'll answer the second question first. With our savings card changes as well as our continued focus of our promotion on only for people with type 2 diabetes, for someone to -- for a new patient to come on to Mounjaro, to have a low out-of-pocket cost, they have to have formulary access. We are only contracting for diabetes access for Mounjaro. So at this point, our assumption is that the vast majority of new people who are new to Mounjaro have type 2 diabetes. On the incretin market, yes, it's really growing both across type 2 diabetes. It's really surge as well as on the obesity front. We plan to aggressively promote and offer this product in both disease classes and invest appropriately to the opportunity. We're not surprised by the market growth in type 2 diabetes. We think there's a big opportunity to really help people who have type 2 diabetes early in the course of treatment to improve their long-term health outcomes. And then as the SURMOUNT-2 data demonstrated, there's just a tremendous unmet need in the obesity market. And we're not surprised by Wegovy's uptake after the resupply and relaunch. And I just really think it really points to the tremendous opportunity that we have to really help patients and meet the needs of the marketplace. So really no changes for us. We felt that both markets would have good growth opportunities. We're prepared to be successful and both grow the market and grow our share in type 2 diabetes and then establish ourself in the chronic weight management market.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Colin Bristow from UBS.\nColin Bristow : Congrats on the quarter and the SURMOUNT-2 data. So on Mounjaro, I think it's comforting to see handsome step-up from 4Q. I was wondering, can you help us think about the sort of continued cadence of improvement over the balance of the year? And then more importantly, how should we think about gross to net post approval in obesity? Is it reasonable to expect another kind of step down temporarily? Or would that not be the case? And then just on the Mounjaro and obesity, can you just walk us through the anticipated time lines here and the potential use of a priority review voucher?\nDavid Ricks : Okay. Mike, you can go ahead and cover these points kind of general gross to net thoughts and trends and then Colin's question about potential use of a priority review voucher.\nMichael Mason : Okay, appreciate that. On the gross to net progression for Mounjaro, I think it's best to look at our paid TRxs, which we define as those patients who's not supported by our $25 noncoverage savings program. That was our original program at launch. You see from the slide that Anat presented early on that we have seen just really good growth of the paid TRxs over time. If you take a look at the growth from Q1 versus Q4, it was a 55% growth in paid TRxs. If you look at the point in time of the week before we started the saving card changes to last week, we've increased paid TRx growth by almost 2.5x. So we're very happy with that. That's the trend we need to see to improve gross to net. Now at the same time, we look at kind of what we've defined as unpaid scripts, which is those that are supported by the original $25 noncoverage savings programs, those are decreasing. So really, that's the 2 trends you need to see to lead to improved growth to net of paid scripts increasing and unpaid scripts decreasing. Also, we expect those trends to continue. We also have a milestone coming up at the end of June when the original $25 noncovered savings card are set to expire. With chronic weight management approval, we'll talk about that -- and pricing at the appropriate time after approval. With regards to our submission, chronic weight management, our plan, as Dave said, the team is taking this data right now and working feverishly to submit that in the coming weeks. We do have Fast Track designation from the FDA to expect that -- to expedite it. We have a rolling submission. We already submitted the SURMOUNT-1 data. And we are excited to also talk about that. While we think the FDA will act quickly with the Fast Track designation, we want to remove any uncertainty. And so we will be using a PRV and expect that we'll get approval as early as the end of this year.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets.\nEvan Seigerman : First off, congrats on the great data today. Very exciting for patients. Just taking a step back, I'd love to get some color as to how Lilly plans to balance the commercial potential of Mounjaro in both diabetes and obesity with estimates that really could best the top-selling pharmaceutical products now without overstressing the U.S. health care system, especially essentially balancing volume and cost to the system.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Evan, for the question. Mike, we'll go back to you balancing commercial potential with potential stress to the system. Thoughts?\nMichael Mason : Yes, it's a good question. And when we look at the opportunity within, let's say the chronic weight management marketplace, it's easy to look at the number of people who live with obesity both in the U.S. and globally, and look at, boy, this could have a big impact on health care costs. But I think if you look more at the real true potential that we focus so much on weight loss, but when you look at not only the -- what does weight loss really provide, there's over 200 complications associated with living with obesity. And as we get more and closer to the marketplace and look at our modeling, we do think that this is going to relieve and reduce the risk of complications associated with obesity, and there will be medical cost savings associated with using these agents, which will, I think, be of great societal value. Also, when you look at the quality of life results that we saw from SURMOUNT-1, they were remarkable. And at times, it's hard to quantify those in a cost-effectiveness model. But in real life, those impact patients significantly. And I think it really does highlight how important these treatments are to people who live with obesity. And so I think as you look at the impact not at like a population level but on a patient level, these agents on tirzepatide will provide great value to society.\nDavid Ricks : Yes. Maybe just to add, I think the latest data from the Medicare Trust is that we're spending about $1 trillion a year as a country on obesity-related complications and comorbidities. I don't think we always do a very good job of thinking about buying pharmaceuticals as an investment and future savings in our health. Maybe we do better when it's acute like COVID. I think we spent tens of billions on COVID therapies and didn't question it as much. But here's -- I think even in the most rosy forecast, we're not going to sell $1 trillion of obesity drugs. So the question is more like, over time, can we demonstrate that treatment today reduces cost downstream? We're highly confident that, that will be a multiple of 5x, 10x savings for whatever people invest in the medicines. We have to prove that. That's our job as an innovative company is to do the outcome studies that demonstrate that. I think our competitors are doing the same thing, and that will be good for the field. And as I've said before, it's hard to imagine by the end of this decade that everyone doesn't just accept that pharmacologic treatment for overweight and obesity should be the standard of care, and it will save this health care system trillions of dollars over time. So that's our position and we need to fight for that position. We also need to do the work. And right now, we are talking about weight loss numbers, not outcomes. But that data is coming soon, as early as next year for tirzepatide.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs.\nChris Shibutani : With and thinking about its safety tolerability profile, I think we have a base level of precedent data that sort of frames expectations for what the ARIA rates are, including last fall when you have the head-to-head for -- where I think there was some relative improvement, recognizing that there's difference in patient populations. Now that you're doing this study, there's aspects of this where you have dosing intervals that include placebo. You also talked about using blood-based biomarkers. Can you help us frame expectations for what would be a meaningful differential? Should we have baseline expectations that reflect more of the prior data? Or is there really room to improve? And when you think about all of these MRI and blood-based biomarkers, how much is this going to be sort of logically natural relative to how patients are cared for? Or is this also going to require some threading in of new ways that patients are managed, which I know that you're investing tremendously in? But just help us with the logic of results from these studies like TB6.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Chris. That's a lot to unpack in the question, but I'll hand over to Dan for some commentary on TB6.\nDaniel Skovronsky : No. Thanks, Chris. I'm glad you raised this. It's a topic that we think a lot about. Probably just starting with maybe correcting a misperception in the field around ARIA rates, I think we don't really know what asymptomatic ARIA means is sort of an incidental finding on an advanced brain scan. We don't want to over-index on that. We want to focus on symptomatic ARIA. And symptomatic ARIA rates, that's what the patient experiences is adverse is a range from sort of 5% to 10% or less across the class. We don't understand all the factors that could cause 1 patient of symptomatic ARIA and another patient to have a symptomatic ARIA, which we see is not a problem. That's what we want to understand better in this study. Are there things that we can see on baseline MRIs or on blood biomarkers that might predict who's going to have those symptomatic ARIAs? And then are there adjustments to dosing that you could have in those patients so they can still get the benefit of the drug without getting the symptomatic ARIA? I don't see this as a study where there's a positive outcome or a negative outcome. It's not a binary thing here. What it's going to do is add to our understanding of how best to identify patients and how best to change dosing in patients who have the highest risk that overall, that should lead the field to have more comfort using these drugs, the entire class of drugs probably in more responsible ways.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nGeoffrey Meacham : Congrats on the data. Just have a couple of related ones for Dan. On SURMOUNT-4, I know we don't have data yet but are there lessons to be learned commercially about the rebound effect once you discontinue tirzepatide? And just wasn't sure what your thoughts of on continuity of therapy in the real world. And the second one is that when you think about tirzepatide development in other settings like sleep apnea, et cetera, there are a lot of indications that you could still go after but haven't officially announced When you look outside of diabetes or obesity, what is the criteria for selecting tirzepatide development versus, say, the oral versus GGG, et cetera?\nGeoffrey Meacham : Thanks, Geoff. Okay, I'll start and I'll let Mike follow up on commercial questions here. Starting with your question on SURMOUNT-4, sort of asking what are our expectations and implications of what happens when people come off this drug, I think unfortunately, tirzepatide is probably like every other drug we have, which is requires you to take it to continue to get the benefits. That's the expectation we have for blood pressure drugs and lipid-lowering drugs and probably we should have that for some time for drugs to manage obesity. What does that mean in the real world for patients? My expectation is many patients may try coming off the drug completely to see what happens. Maybe some will be successful in maintaining their weight, but many of them will probably experience some regression of their weight back towards baseline. And this could prompt them to come back on the drug. That's probably natural and we can expect that, although Mike will comment in a second on commercial dynamics. In terms of other indications, we really look at things that could have a big impact via weight loss. There's never been a drug like tirzepatide that can cause this amount of weight loss. So mostly, we're looking through literature on things like bariatric surgery and seeing what kind of benefits that can lead to or diet and exercise. And that's how we've gotten to a few indications that you mentioned, sleep apnea and heart failure, among others. In terms of which drug could be best right now, of course, we have the most confidence around tirzepatide, but there might be some indications where a drug like redatrutide, which adds glucagon and call it GGG, could be better. For example, glucagon has profound effects on fat in the liver, so maybe that plays better for complications of obesity related to liver disease like NASH. Orforglipron, on the other hand, our oral, unlikely to have as much weight loss as profound metabolic improvements as tirzepatide does because it doesn't have any GIP, which is an important constituent of tirzepatide. But on the other hand, the ease of use may make it more applicable to some broader, more primary care indications. So that's a little bit of thinking on how we sort those out. Mike?\nMichael Mason : Yes. On the commercial side, as we launch into the chronic weight management market for tirzepatide, we'll be very upfront with payers and health care professionals and consumers that this is a chronic disease and a chronic medication that needs to be adhered to long term. When you look at how this product works, one of the most important aspects of it is that it controls and reduces appetite. When someone tries to gain -- to lose weight via diet and exercise, as someone is successful in losing weight, the body actually works against that and tugs it the opposite way by increasing the appetite. That's why these agents, tirzepatide does work because it does reduce the appetite. So while on therapy, we anticipate that the appetite will be lowered and maintained. And then if stopped, then the appetite will increase. Now this is something that unlike most drugs, you don't know if you stop taking like a statin or something else, you don't really feel any effects. We do think that, that will be a noticeable effect that will begin soon after stopping therapy even before you start seeing weight gain. So I think we think that will be an important kind of signal for a patient to understand that this is a chronic disease and needs to be treated long term. As it goes into the -- maybe 1 other aspect on the additional indications, we talk a lot about access and the need for in order to get access into Part D. And obviously, that will be an important thing overarching. But these additional indications are important for the senior population. Complications run with living with obesity, and they emerge into complications when you reach Medicare like type 2 diabetes, like sleep apnea and like heart failure. And so we believe these are important indications to study because we think these are important health conditions. But also commercially, we think this is important because this will help us get access for these really important complications that are really important to the senior population. So commercially, we think these are really important. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI.\nUmer Raffat : I have a question on drug pricing, especially as it relates to Mounjaro. A, what's your expectation on net price per patient beyond the first year on Mounjaro? And I realize the compliance as well as maintenance pricing would be considerations. And secondly, in a scenario where Ozempic and Trulicity are in the IRA basket in 2027, should it be our base case that there would not be an impact to the non-Medicare book of business? And would it not impact other members in the class like Mounjaro? I feel like it's not super clear. I'd be curious about your thoughts.\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Mike. I'm sorry. Thanks, Umer. I'll maybe go to Mike for the kind of question about net pricing on Mounjaro and how that might evolve and then also on general commentary around if Ozempic is in the IRA basket, what might the impact be to others. Mike?\nMichael Mason : Yes. No, good question. I mean, on net pricing, we have 1 price point for Mounjaro. We have flat pricing across the dosing form so people can feel free to find the right dose that works for them at the same price. That will be the same price for new starts, it is for people on maintenance to treatment.\nDavid Ricks : Yes. And if I got your question right and just to clarify, it's not clear to us that semaglutide and dulaglutide will be eligible in the same year for IRA, if they're eligible, depending on sales two years prior in the various ways the government is proposing to do this. But let's just play it out if sema is selected because it's a small molecule 9 years from launch, et cetera. What will happen in the commercial market? Nobody knows because in the draft guidance, there really isn't a lot of clarity about how the government proposes to effectuate the so-called maximum fair price to the consumer level. They're entertaining a few ideas, it appears, from their initial guidance. I think we're expecting more regulatory, either definitive regulatory statements or proposals for comment in the coming 90 days, Umer. But I can tell you what we'd prefer is that since we're not a party to that transaction as manufacturers in this example, not us, but someone else, we would probably need a third party to determine, is that a valid Part D prescription? Is it eligible for the maximum fair price? And then to step in and match that transaction up post hoc. We did something like that when the donut hole was created, and it worked pretty well with third-party administrators. This is what we've suggested that the administration will be the best thing. And in that scenario, you would not have a wholesale price reduction to reach the maximum fair price. You would do it after the fact, and I think in that way, be able to keep the two segments, commercial and government a little bit more separate. That has obvious advantage for the industry and probably for payers as well and maybe for patients, creating certainty and lack of arbitrage across physical distribution channels. So to be determined there, but as that detail comes out, we'll have more commentary on it, but ball's in the government's court now.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research.\nTimothy Anderson : I wanted to ask some questions about the obesity opportunity in ex U.S. markets because I know it seems like all the discussion is about the U.S. markets. But in your opinion, how will it play out ex U.S. relative to the U.S. when you think about obesity over the longer term? To me, it seems like payers are likely to be much more restrictive ex U.S. with a product like this. Is that a fair characterization? Or do you think low enough pricing will fully offset any sort of hesitation and basically open up the markets equally like it will happen in the U.S.?\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Tim, for the really good question. I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, our President of Lilly International to weigh in on that.\nIlya Yuffa : Tim, thanks for the question. As we take a look at the chronic weight management market internationally outside the U.S., it's a significant opportunity. We already see significant utilization of current therapies that don't provide as much weight loss and benefit and still providing significant commercial opportunity and also access to patients. A lot of that is happening in many markets out of pocket. At the same time, there are markets that are already moving towards reimbursement, U.K. and other markets in Europe, already looking at ways to reimburse, especially in the higher BMI categories of obesity. And so this will play out over time on both as we look at data and outcomes to drive further an expansion of access. And also, we do foresee a significant out-of-pocket market in many countries, including Asia, South America and Europe as well. And so I think you'll see that grow over time, but significant opportunity to take a look at the total population globally that is obese, overweight, there's a significant opportunity outside of the U.S. for chronic weight management, and we'll look to invest in expanding that both the introduction of Mounjaro tirzepatide in chronic weight management but also improving access over time.\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Ilya, and thanks, Tim, for the question. Running low on time, so we'll try to get through as many questions as possible. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Scala from Cowen.\nSteve Scala : I appreciate that data presentation is key to fully answering the question, but what opportunities are still available to Verzenio in the adjuvant setting now that we have seen the top line of NATALEE? It would be easy to conclude NATALEE is a significant risk to Verzenio adjuvant use and that Verzenio adjuvant use will decline. What other scenarios would you like us to consider? And what aspects of NATALEE would you like to highlight?\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Steve, for the question. I'll hand over to Jake Van Naarden to weigh in on the opportunity.\nJacob Van Naarden : I'm not sure I agree with your framing, I'm not sure we agree. The NATALEE success is not really a surprise to us. We said publicly, we expected it to be positive. We frankly thought it would be positive actually at the last interim analysis at the end of last year. Just by way of reminder, we studied Verzenio in the adjuvant setting, given for two years, specifically in a high-risk population, which is a population that we and I think physicians agree is the 1 that really requires intensification of therapy. And now Verzenio is the standard of care in that setting. We don't really expect that to change actually. We have mature follow-up on our data as last presented at San Antonio in December. We have a Category 1 NCCN listing for Verzenio in the setting. I think Verzenio's role in high-risk adjuvant endocrine positive breast cancer is pretty clear. We seem to hear a lot of noise about ribociclib in intermediate risk population, a population that we didn't study, a population for whom I think the risk benefit is a little bit more questionable. And to the extent that the data we see at ASCO provides a role for that drug in that setting, sure. That's fine. That really doesn't pose any threat to the forecasted opportunity for Verzenio in the high-risk setting where we still remain very confident in its prospects.\nOperator: The next question is coming from David Risinger from SVB Securities.\nDavid Risinger : So congrats on all the updates. I just wanted to get your take on NOVOS, Wegovy-SELEcT cardiovascular outcomes trial and potential implications. So I think expectations are that the efficacy could be modest. Could you comment on that scenario and then also comment on the scenario that the trial surprisingly fails?\nDavid Ricks : Thanks, Steve. I'll hand over to Dan for a quick update.\nDaniel Skovronsky : Thanks, Dave. Maybe some of those questions are better addressed to Novo. I think based on passing an interim without stopping early, you can sort of put an upper limit on how good the efficacy could be. But we don't know exactly what that will be. I expect I think most people reasonably expect the trial will be positive. We know that weight loss has so many benefits, including cardiovascular benefits, and that's likely to be demonstrated in a large clinical trial. No idea what the number will be here, the stats or anything like that. But I'll be surprised if weight loss doesn't translate into benefits. We, of course, have our own studies going both in the type 2 and diabetes population and in the obesity population. We'll look forward to those outcomes.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Kerry Holford from Berenberg.\nKerry Holford : Two questions, please. First from mirikizumab. Can you provide any more detail on the specific issue the FDA has in manufacturing that when you expect to refile whether you would anticipate a Class 1 or 2 responders and indeed whether you take to launch in the U.S. this year. Secondly, a question for Anat on [indiscernible]. So you've announced two divestments here in quick succession. Just interested to see, is there anything specifically driving this? Are there any additional noncore assets that you're seeking to monetize? And then as you divest your priorities for the use of cash? Clearly expecting to say internal R&D investments. But I'm wondering, too, if we can expect any more external R&D investment.\nDavid Ricks : Maybe in the interest of time, since we have just a couple of minutes, let's focus on the first question, and we can connect with IR on the second questions afterwards. So mirikizumab update, I hand over to Patrick for that.\nPatrik Jonsson : Thank you very much, Kerry. As Dan stated earlier, the CRL did not cite their concerns in regards to the clinical profile of miri, but only certain aspects of the proposed commercial manufacturing process. And generally, we don't disclose the details about timing of our interactions with the FDA. But I can say that we are working very closely together with the FDA today to address the questions and also discussing the details of the next steps to understand the time line. But we remain very confident to launch miri as first-in-class in ulcerative colitis also in the U.S. In the meantime, I'm extremely happy with the launch of the approval in and a positive opinion by the European regulatory body. And we are looking forward to launches outside the U.S. as early as late Q2.\nJoe Fletcher : Paul, maybe time for 1 last question, so maybe send through the last -- 1 last question from the queue.\nOperator: The last question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo.\nMohit Bansal : Congrats, again. Just a question on long-term capacity for Mounjaro. I know you are trying to thinking about doubling this year, but longer term, you have talked about double of Trulicity. If you look at consensus numbers or what Street is projecting, even that may not be enough. So how are you thinking about increasing the capacity in the longer term for Mounjaro?\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Mohit. I'll hand it to Dave for that question, and then we'll round out.\nDave Ricks: Okay. I'll go right to wrap-up after that. Thanks for the question. Obviously, key. Right now, we have the unique situation of having a product so useful, we can't make enough of it really. And I think when we expand the label, it will continue to put pressure on that. I suspect this whole category will have supply pressure for some time. We're basically in an all-of-the-above moment here in terms of investing in capacity and thinking of alternative ways to expand use and make this -- fulfill the need that's out there. So we've made certain announcements we've talked about the RTP site this year. Our sister site in North Carolina, really the following year beginning to produce, that's of equivalent size. We've also made additional capacity investments in the original RTP site, which will expand the numbers further. And then today, we're talking about other delivery systems that could be providing even more capacity available for global demand fulfillment. So we're on a road map here that we're excited about in the endpoint. I think we'll probably all be a little more frustrated and impatient in the short term with the rate of expansion. But rest assured, the line is going up into the right at a pretty steep angle in terms of our volume and output, and we expect that to continue for several years to come. So working hard on this problem, happy with the progress, need to make more progress, and we've got plans to do that from here. I'll also just close that comment by just punctuating a little bit the importance of the orforglipron program in terms of meeting -- fully meeting the demand that could be something like hundreds of millions of patients per year, oral solid. We know the globe has massive capacity. It's cheaper and easier to make, and that product has a lot of promise clinically but also significant profits in terms of addressing needs, particularly middle-income markets in China and other very large opportunities. And with that, let me close the call today, and thank you all for participating in this earnings call once again and your interest in Lilly and what we're doing. It's been an eventful and productive start to 2023, and we -- as we execute on our innovation rate strategy and bring all these new medicines to patients. I want to thank you again for dialing in. And please follow up with the IR team. I know we didn't get all the questions today. And if you have additional questions, please give them a call today. Have a great one, and we'll talk again soon. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide six summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2023, and I'll focus my comments on non-GAAP performance. In Q1, revenue declined 11% versus Q1 2022. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, revenues increased 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, highlighting solid momentum for our business despite a substantial headwind from a loss of exclusivity in the United States, which did not yet face meaningful generic competition in the base period. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased 230 basis points to 78.4% in Q1 2023. The increase in gross margin percent was driven primarily by lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies, partially offset by lower realized prices. Total operating expenses increased 15% this quarter. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12%, driven by higher marketing and selling expenses associated with recent and upcoming product launches and indications. R&D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets. This quarter, we recognized acquired IP R&D charges of $105 million or $0.10 of EPS. In Q1 2022, acquired IP R&D and development milestone charges totaled $166 million or $0.15 of EPS. Operating income decreased 38% in Q1, driven by lower revenue, primarily due to 0 sales of COVID-19 antibodies this quarter, paired with higher R&D and SG&A expenses. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 23% for the quarter and reflected a negative impact of approximately 150 basis points attributable to acquired IP R&D charges. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 12.8%. This represents an increase of 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022, driven primarily by the tax impact of the new Puerto Rico tax regime. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $1.62. On Slide seven, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. This quarter, U.S. revenue declined 14%. As a reminder, COVID-19 antibody revenue in Q1 of 2022 totaled approximately $1.5 billion compared to zero in Q1 of this year. When excluding revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, U.S. revenue grew 19%, driven by robust volume growth for Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. We experienced a net price decline of 5% in the U.S. for the quarter, driven primarily by Humalog and Trulicity. As we move into the second half of 2023, we expect U.S. pricing headwind versus prior year will ease considerably driven by Mounjaro access and saving cards dynamics. Europe continued its steady growth trajectory with revenue in Q1 growing 8% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume growth for Verzenio, Trulicity, Jardiance and Taltz. Volume in Europe increased 13% in Q1. For Japan, Q1 revenue increased 7% in constant currency as the base period impact of generic competition to Cymbalta and Alimta waned, and we continue to see strong robust growth in our newer medicines led by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, Jardiance. Moving to China. Revenue declined 1% in constant currency with volume growth of 19% offset by net price declines. Volume growth was driven by Verzenio and, to a lesser extent, increase in shipments of Olumiant. Price declines were largely driven by Humalog, which was added to the volume-based procurement scheme in Q2 of last year. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased 9% in constant currency, driven by the sales of rights to Cialis in Taiwan and Saudi Arabia for $95 million in Q1 of 2022, partially offset by growth in Verzenio, Mounjaro and Jardiance. Slide eight shows the contribution to worldwide volume growth by product category. As Dave mentioned earlier, we have evolved a prior product categorization from key growth products, which included 10 key products launched since 2014 to now focus on 2 categories, the first called new product and the second called growth product. The new product categories led by Mounjaro and also includes Jaypirca, and we expect to expand to include new products in the coming months and years. The growth product category is made up of select products that have been in the market for several years with continued exclusivity. As you can see, the new and growth product categories contributed over 20 percentage points of volume growth for the quarter, which was largely offset by the previously mentioned decline in COVID-19 antibody revenue. While the lack of revenue from COVID-19 antibody will be a headwind to growth throughout the year, the most substantial impact was in Q1. As I mentioned earlier, in Q1 2022, we realized approximately $1.5 billion of revenue from COVID-19 antibodies, representing 75% of the $2 billion sold in the full year 2022. Slide 9 provides additional perspective on the trends and specific highlights across our product categories. I'll speak more about Mounjaro shortly, but first, let me highlight the continued outstanding performance of Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales growth of 60% in Q1 as the long-term monarchE follow-up data shared at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December and the recently expanded label support continued uptake in adjuvant breast cancer. Verzenio is now the standard of care in its Category 1 NCCN listed for high-risk adjuvant breast cancer. Jardiance also continued its outstanding performance with worldwide sales growth of 38% for the quarter. In Q1, we were pleased to announce that based on the results of the Phase III DYNAMO trial, the FDA accepted the supplemental New Drug Application for Jardiance for children 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes. And lastly, we continue to be encouraged by the strength of Trulicity's performance in a growing and dynamic incretin market. Worldwide sales of Trulicity grew 14% in Q1, anchored by the product's robust efficacy and safety profile, coupled with the convenient and easy-to-use device. Looking more holistically at Trulicity and Mounjaro together, U.S. revenue for these two products grew 59% in Q1 2023 versus Q1 2022. Moving to Slide 10. Let me share some commentary and context on Mounjaro's performance for the quarter. We are pleased with the positive momentum over the course of Q1 as it means more patients with type 2 diabetes are realizing the substantial benefits of treatment with Mounjaro. While the trajectory of prescription growth shifted following our actions in Q4 to reinforce the intended use of Mounjaro savings program by type 2 diabetes patients, we have continued to see a positive overall trend. Our focus is on driving new-to-brand growth while continuing to expand access. In Q1, we initiated our first Mounjaro direct-to-consumer TV campaign, and we continue to steadily build access from Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, access stood at just under 60% for patients with type 2 diabetes across commercial and Part D. We estimate that the percentage of paid scripts for Mounjaro in Q1 was just over 55%, up from approximately 40% in Q4 2022. As a reminder, we define paid scripts as those prescription outside the $25 non-covered co-pay cards but inclusive of the $25 covered co-pay card. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of the year, we expect continued improvement in access in the proportion of paid scripts and in new-to-brand prescription. On Slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. In Q1 2023, we invested $2.7 billion in our future growth through a combination of R&D expenditures, business development outlays and capital investments. In addition, we returned just over $1 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $700 million in stock. Slide 12 represents our updated 2023 financial guidance. Starting with revenue, we are increasing the revenue guidance range by $900 million to now be in the range of $31.2 billion to $31.7 billion. Since announcing our 2023 financial guidance in December, the U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies. We have updated our full year revenue outlook based on recent spot rates. This FX update is driving approximately $650 million of the $900 million increase in our revenue guidance. The remainder of the increase is attributable to underlying business performance. Our guidance for gross margin as a percent of revenue remains unchanged. In terms of operating expenses, we are increasing the range of marketing, selling and administrative costs by $100 million to reflect our updated exchange rate assumptions. This results in an updated range of $7 billion to $7.2 billion. We are also increasing the range for research and development expenses by $100 million, driven by updated exchange rate assumptions and investments in our late-stage portfolio. This results in an updated R&D range of $8.3 billion to $8.5 billion. We have incorporated IP R&D charges that have been incurred or realized as of the date of earnings, which totaled $105 million. Consistent with prior quarters, we have not included any IP R&D charges associated with potential or pending business development transactions. Additionally, the recently announced agreements to sell the right of our linsepene portfolio and have not been included in guidance. Each transactions will be factored into our financial guidance after it closes. Other income and expenses and tax rate guidance remain unchanged. Based on these changes, we are raising our full year reported EPS guidance to now be in the range of $8.18 to $8.38 per share and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance to be in the range of $8.65 to $8.85. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress in R&D."

            "content": "Thanks, Dan. Yes, we do remain confident in the mid- and long-term opportunity for donanemab. And I think it's important to remember, it will take time to build this market. And so as Dan said, we're investing in these efforts now, building awareness of diagnostics, the awareness of treatments are coming, making sure that the health care systems are ready for these medicines and that the care pathway is set up, and then most importantly, as you said, that patients have access and reimbursement. And just to echo his comments, I don't think we really think of this as a cost of drugs we need to fight over market share. It's an opportunity to build a new class on behalf of disease, driving awareness, driving diagnosis and then getting access. So that's important to us in the near term."

            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. Let me start with today's exciting announcement, the positive results for tirzepatide in the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III study. Tirzepatide met the co-primary study endpoints and also hit on all prespecified key secondary endpoints. Participants with obesity or overweight and with type 2 diabetes achieved up to 16% weight loss at 72 weeks, which translates to a mean weight loss of 34 pounds. Additionally, 86% of people taking 15-milligram tirzepatide achieved at least 5% body rate reduction. This was in line with our expectations based on our SURPASS-3 data in a similar population. With this SURMOUNT-2 data, we now have two positive Phase III trials for tirzepatide in obesity, 1 in patients without type 2 diabetes and 1 in patients with type 2 diabetes. We now look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. I'll cover the SURMOUNT-2 results in more detail, but first, let me spend a few minutes providing an overview of the SURMOUNT Phase III program. The SURMOUNT program has enrolled more than 5,000 people with obesity or overweight across 8 studies. On Slide 13, you can see key trial design elements for the core SURMOUNT-1 through four studies as well as the more recently announced SURMOUNT-MMO and SURMOUNT-5 studies. Five of the six studies compare efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to placebo as an adjunct to reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity, while the most recently posted trial, SURMOUNT-5 compares tirzepatide to 2.4-milligram semaglutide. As a reminder, SURMOUNT-1 was designed to evaluate treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people without type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight with at least 1 comorbidity. And it delivered up to 22.5% mean body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2, which we're reporting today, evaluated treatment with tirzepatide compared to placebo for people with obesity or overweight and type 2 diabetes. SURMOUNT-3 will provide data on maximizing weight loss following an intensive lifestyle program and SURMOUNT-4 evaluates maintaining weight loss. SURMOUNT-5 is an open-label trial that will enroll 700 adults who have obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities without type 2 diabetes and will compare the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide to semaglutide 2.4-milligrams. Finally, SURMOUNT-MMO is our Phase III morbidity and mortality and obesity study to evaluate improved outcomes for patients with obesity. We expect the next two studies, SURMOUNT-3 and SURMOUNT-4 to read out later this year, while SURMOUNT-5 is anticipated to complete in the first half of 2025. SURMOUNT-MMO, as an outcome study, will take several more years to complete. On Slide 14, you can see the first co-primary endpoint in the SURMOUNT-2 study where tirzepatide 15-milligram delivered 15.7% mean body weight reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes with obesity or overweight. With a baseline weight across the study of 222 pounds, tirzepatide treatment led to a mean body weight reduction of 34 pounds on the 15-milligram arm of the study. We're also very pleased to see how well the 10-milligram tirzepatide performed with a 13.4% mean body weight reduction, also at 72 weeks for the efficacy estimand. Results for the treatment regimen estimand were similar to the efficacy estimand and are detailed in this morning's SURMOUNT-2 press release. Moving to Slide 15. Tirzepatide achieved the second co-primary endpoint of achieving at least 5% body weight reduction. SURMOUNT-2 showed up to 86.4% of patients achieved this level of weight reduction at 72 weeks, again, using the efficacy estimand. This is compared to 30.6% of patients on placebo as an adjunct to diet and exercise. Furthermore, over half of all participants in the 15-milligram treatment arm achieved at least 15% weight loss. It has been previously observed in incretin obesity trials that weight loss in a type 2 diabetes population is less than weight loss seen in a non-type 2 diabetes population, a finding consistent with the results we've now reported from the SURMOUNT-1 and SURMOUNT-2 trials. The average weight reductions reported in the SURMOUNT-2 trial in patients with type 2 diabetes range from 7% to 8% less than those seen in SURMOUNT-1, which was an exclusively non-type 2 diabetes population. There are a number of potential mechanisms that may explain this effect, including the weight gain-promoting effects of some classes of anti-hyperglycemic medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, improving insulin sensitivity with tirzepatide treatment, gender differences between 2 populations and diminished caloric loss effects of glucosuria. These differences manifested as we expected, and the SURMOUNT-2 top line results represent the most robust weight loss seen in a Phase III pharmacological clinical trial consisting entirely of type 2 diabetes patients with obesity or overweight, and we are highly pleased with these results. Moving to Slide 16. You can see the safety profile from the SURMOUNT-2 study. Tirzepatide was well tolerated in the study participants with the overall safety and tolerability profile similar to incretin-based therapies approved for treatment of obesity. As in SURMOUNT-1 and the SURPASS program, the most commonly reported adverse events were GI-related, were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually occurred through dose escalation. Treatment discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 3.8% and 7.4% for the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms, respectively, compared to 3.8% for placebo. The overall treatment discontinuation rates were 9.3% and 13.8% in the 10- and 15-milligram tirzepatide treatment arms compared to 14.9% for placebo. We look forward to sharing more data from SURMOUNT-2 at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and to submitting the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Obesity is a widespread and chronic disease in need of more effective treatment options. The FDA Fast Track designation that tirzepatide received for obesity reflects the seriousness of the condition and the substantial unmet medical need. With impressive trial results now in hand for SURMOUNT-2 and SURMOUNT-1 studies, we look forward to completing our rolling submission to the FDA for tirzepatide for the treatment of adults with obesity or overweight with weight-related comorbidities in the coming weeks. With respect to regulatory action in Europe, as Dave mentioned, we have already completed our submission to the EMA for chronic weight management indication. The EMA submission was initiated based on the results from the SURPASS trial program in type 2 diabetes and the SURMOUNT-1 Phase III trial in obesity. We expect to have a European Commission decision in the first half of 2024. In addition to all the work on tirzepatide for obesity, we also disclosed earlier this month on clinicaltrials.gov the initiation of a bioequivalent study to compare the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide administered using the existing auto-injector device and a new test device. We expect to work on tirzepatide and other injectable incretins for a long time. And we intend to explore different presentations for these medicines to meet our goal of bringing the benefits to as many patients as possible as quickly as possible. Moving on from tirzepatide to the rest of the portfolio. Slide 17 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 24, and Slide 18 shows potential key events for the year. There have been several important developments since our last earnings call, and I'll cover these by therapeutic area. Continuing within diabetes and metabolic disease. Earlier this month, we began recruiting for the first Phase III clinical trial for orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist. This ACHIEVE-4 trial is an open-label study of orforglipron compared with insulin glargine in adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity or overweight at increased risk for cardiovascular events. This is the first in what will be a broader series of studies for orforglipron. It is the largest and longest trial in the program, which is why we chose to initiate this trial first. Enrollment is now underway and we expect patient dosing to recur shortly, after which orforglipron will be placed with our Phase III assets on the summary slide. You'll also see we have advanced our Relaxin long-acting molecule to Phase II development for treatment of heart failure. Shifting to immunology. It was a quarter of mixed progress for mirikizumab, our IL-23 P19 inhibitor. We were pleased with the approval in late March in Japan for mirikizumab under the brand name for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. A few days later, we were similarly pleased with the positive CHMP opinion from the EMA. However, regarding mirikizumab's regulatory path in the United States, we announced earlier this month that we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA. The letter did not cite any concerns regarding the safety or efficacy profile of mirikizumab but focused exclusively on certain aspects related to the proposed commercial manufacturing of mirikizumab. We remain confident mirikizumab's Phase III data and its potential to help people with ulcerative colitis. We look forward to working with the FDA to address the manufacturing questions in order to achieve our goal of bringing mirikizumab to patients in the U.S. Also in our late phase immunology portfolio, we completed the regulatory submission in Japan for lebrikizumab for patients with atopic dermatitis. Moving earlier in our immunology pipeline, during last month's American Academy of Dermatology meeting, we shared data from the single-dose Phase II trial for eltrecabart, our CXCR1/2 antibody in patients with hydroadonitis The data showed good tolerability and clear separation between eltrecabart and placebo, along with a reduction in abscesses and nodules, reflecting reduced disease activity. Lastly, in immunology, we've removed REsPEG-Aldis leukin from our pipeline. In February, following the top line data announcement from the Phase II study in systemic lupus , we informed our partner, Nektar Therapeutics that we do not intend to advance the asset into Phase III development. Moving on to neuroscience. Last month, we announced that our last active solanezumab trial, the antiamyloid in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease study or A4 study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. The A4 study was conducted through an innovative public-private partnership, and we were thankful for the time and effort of the clinical study staff, participants and study partners. This study formally concludes our clinical development of solanezumab. The A4 results, while disappointing, were not a surprise, given the advancements in our understanding of Alzheimer's disease since the study initiated almost 10 years ago. Solanezumab only targets soluble amyloid beta and does not clear plaque. Denenimab and rimternatug, on the other hand, have been specifically designed to bind to and clear amyloid plaque, and we now understand that substantial plaque clearance is required in order for anti-amyloid drugs to show clinical efficacy. Accordingly, we were pleased to share new data for duninimab and during the International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease in late March. For denetimab, we shared data from our Trailblazer EXT, a Phase II long-term follow-on study of Trailblazer ALS. While study limitations include a relatively small number of patients, the data showed encouraging trends and the longer-term effects on amyloid and tau levels and clinical progression. We also disclosed the trial design and objective for Trailblazer Phase IIIb study to expand the science and understanding of ARIA in relationship to amyloid lowering through imaging and blood-based biomarkers in different dosing paradigms. This study will leverage enhanced MRI sequences as well as blood-based biomarkers and other patient characteristics that may predict ARIA. And we'll investigate the effect of different dosing regimens on the frequency and severity of ARIA. Of course, we expect the next key milestone for genenumab will be later this quarter when we obtain the results for our confirmatory Phase III TRAILBLAZER ALS 2 trial. We look forward to sharing these results and to advancing the regulatory process for assuming positive data from this trial. This quarter, we also shared the first clinical data from [indiscernible] from a Phase I multiple ascending dose study, which highlighted the potential speed and depth of amyloid plaque lowering in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These data on amyloid clearance, safety and tolerability supported our decision to move this asset into Phase III, and we look forward to sharing further updates as the program progresses. You'll also notice we have a number of developments in our early-stage neuroscience portfolio with a Phase II entry for our GBA1 gene therapy asset in the Gaucher disease type 1 indication along with 2 Phase I pain asset entries and 1 Phase II pain asset discontinuation. Shifting now to oncology. Just yesterday, Jaypirca received a positive opinion from the CHMP for the treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. In early March, the FDA approved an expanded indication for Verzenio for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with HR-positive HER2-negative node positive early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence. High-risk patients can now be more easily identified with the removal of the Ki-67 score requirement for patient selection. Moving earlier in our oncology pipeline, we presented data from our Phase I study of our KRASG12C inhibitor as part of the AACR meeting last week. These data show promising efficacy and the potential for a differentiated safety profile in combination with pembrolizumab. We're working on finalizing dose selection for our drug in combination with pembrolizumab. And at AACR, we also showed data from CYCLONE 1, a single-arm unblinded study, which was the first to investigate Verzenio in prostate cancer. This early study informed the design of our CYCLONE 2 adaptive Phase II/III trial, which last year cleared our preset threshold to advance to Phase III and for which we expect to read out as soon as late this year. Q1 was another busy and productive quarter for pipeline advancement at Lilly. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Yes. Thanks, Seamus. I'll start sort of on the data expectations and how it might fit in and maybe Anne will add some things on commercial opportunity. So I think we had very compelling data in Phase II, 32% slowing of disease progression. If in Phase III, we can replicate those kinds of results, this will be a very important and meaningful drug. I know it's interesting for investors to sort of speculate on competition between 2 different pharma companies. It's not exactly how I think about it. I think there's a huge opportunity here for patients. The challenge is not really about competition. It's about how do we help the medical system better identify patients, diagnose them and move them into treatment regimens, of course, requiring reimbursement. I think the two drugs, however, have some important differences. Dunanumab targets specifically amyloid plaques. We think that's the relevant species to hit in Alzheimer's disease. I think we were pretty confident about that in the past, probably the solanezumab data, which targeted just soluble adds even more confidence to that statement. As a result of hitting just amyloid plaques, that allows us to have fixed duration dosing regimens as an option for patients. Let's see how the data turn out. But I expect that many patients will be able to stop dosing even as soon as 12 months. That's a big difference than being prescribed a drug that you might have to take the rest of your life. And I think that could be exciting and important for patients. So lots of ways for donanemab to win. I think the most important thing, though, is showing consistent strong efficacy like we did in Phase II and then getting this drug approved and bringing it to patients. Anne, what do you have? No. Thanks, Chris. I'm glad you raised this. It's a topic that we think a lot about. Probably just starting with maybe correcting a misperception in the field around ARIA rates, I think we don't really know what asymptomatic ARIA means is sort of an incidental finding on an advanced brain scan. We don't want to over-index on that. We want to focus on symptomatic ARIA. And symptomatic ARIA rates, that's what the patient experiences is adverse is a range from sort of 5% to 10% or less across the class. We don't understand all the factors that could cause 1 patient of symptomatic ARIA and another patient to have a symptomatic ARIA, which we see is not a problem. That's what we want to understand better in this study. Are there things that we can see on baseline MRIs or on blood biomarkers that might predict who's going to have those symptomatic ARIAs? And then are there adjustments to dosing that you could have in those patients so they can still get the benefit of the drug without getting the symptomatic ARIA? I don't see this as a study where there's a positive outcome or a negative outcome. It's not a binary thing here. What it's going to do is add to our understanding of how best to identify patients and how best to change dosing in patients who have the highest risk that overall, that should lead the field to have more comfort using these drugs, the entire class of drugs probably in more responsible ways. Thanks, Dave. Maybe some of those questions are better addressed to Novo. I think based on passing an interim without stopping early, you can sort of put an upper limit on how good the efficacy could be. But we don't know exactly what that will be. I expect I think most people reasonably expect the trial will be positive. We know that weight loss has so many benefits, including cardiovascular benefits, and that's likely to be demonstrated in a large clinical trial. No idea what the number will be here, the stats or anything like that. But I'll be surprised if weight loss doesn't translate into benefits. We, of course, have our own studies going both in the type 2 and diabetes population and in the obesity population. We'll look forward to those outcomes."

As Dan stated earlier, the CRL did not cite their concerns in regards to the clinical profile of miri, but only certain aspects of the proposed commercial manufacturing process. And generally, we don't disclose the details about timing of our interactions with the FDA. But I can say that we are working very closely together with the FDA today to address the questions and also discussing the details of the next steps to understand the time line. But we remain very confident to launch miri as first-in-class in ulcerative colitis also in the U.S. In the meantime, I'm extremely happy with the launch of the approval in and a positive opinion by the European regulatory body. And we are looking forward to launches outside the U.S. as early as late Q2."

            "name": "Michael Mason",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Terence, for that question. On the branding question, obviously, yes, we're not going to provide any clarity on that. I think if you look at the kind of pros and cons on 1 versus 2 brands, the pros are, it is a more efficient supply chain and manufacturing for 1 brand, for 2 brands or some access benefits. Also, you have an empty vessel for the commercial promotion of our obesity indication with the 2-brand scenarios. So that's kind of the puts and takes on that part. On the supply, I think maybe I'll answer the overall supply question because I'm sure there may be other questions on there. We talked last year that our focus was to double capacity by the end of this year, and we're progressing toward that goal. Our manufacturing team is working hard every day and directly delivering over our manufacturing plan this year. We believe that our channel inventory for Q2 will be a bit better for what we saw in Q1. And obviously, as you bring up, the important milestone is us bringing our first [indiscernible] brand fully online this year. The manufacturing team is progressing toward that goal. And then long term, we're investing where we need to in order to create a long-term significant supply across our entire incretin portfolio to meet what we think is going to just be a tremendous demand globally for the product and for all our incretin portfolio. Okay. I'll answer the second question first. With our savings card changes as well as our continued focus of our promotion on only for people with type 2 diabetes, for someone to -- for a new patient to come on to Mounjaro, to have a low out-of-pocket cost, they have to have formulary access. We are only contracting for diabetes access for Mounjaro. So at this point, our assumption is that the vast majority of new people who are new to Mounjaro have type 2 diabetes. On the incretin market, yes, it's really growing both across type 2 diabetes. It's really surge as well as on the obesity front. We plan to aggressively promote and offer this product in both disease classes and invest appropriately to the opportunity. We're not surprised by the market growth in type 2 diabetes. We think there's a big opportunity to really help people who have type 2 diabetes early in the course of treatment to improve their long-term health outcomes. And then as the SURMOUNT-2 data demonstrated, there's just a tremendous unmet need in the obesity market. And we're not surprised by Wegovy's uptake after the resupply and relaunch. And I just really think it really points to the tremendous opportunity that we have to really help patients and meet the needs of the marketplace. So really no changes for us. We felt that both markets would have good growth opportunities. We're prepared to be successful and both grow the market and grow our share in type 2 diabetes and then establish ourself in the chronic weight management market. Okay, appreciate that. On the gross to net progression for Mounjaro, I think it's best to look at our paid TRxs, which we define as those patients who's not supported by our $25 noncoverage savings program. That was our original program at launch. You see from the slide that Anat presented early on that we have seen just really good growth of the paid TRxs over time. If you take a look at the growth from Q1 versus Q4, it was a 55% growth in paid TRxs. If you look at the point in time of the week before we started the saving card changes to last week, we've increased paid TRx growth by almost 2.5x. So we're very happy with that. That's the trend we need to see to improve gross to net. Now at the same time, we look at kind of what we've defined as unpaid scripts, which is those that are supported by the original $25 noncoverage savings programs, those are decreasing. So really, that's the 2 trends you need to see to lead to improved growth to net of paid scripts increasing and unpaid scripts decreasing. Also, we expect those trends to continue. We also have a milestone coming up at the end of June when the original $25 noncovered savings card are set to expire. With chronic weight management approval, we'll talk about that -- and pricing at the appropriate time after approval. With regards to our submission, chronic weight management, our plan, as Dave said, the team is taking this data right now and working feverishly to submit that in the coming weeks. We do have Fast Track designation from the FDA to expect that -- to expedite it. We have a rolling submission. We already submitted the SURMOUNT-1 data. And we are excited to also talk about that. While we think the FDA will act quickly with the Fast Track designation, we want to remove any uncertainty. And so we will be using a PRV and expect that we'll get approval as early as the end of this year. Yes, it's a good question. And when we look at the opportunity within, let's say the chronic weight management marketplace, it's easy to look at the number of people who live with obesity both in the U.S. and globally, and look at, boy, this could have a big impact on health care costs. But I think if you look more at the real true potential that we focus so much on weight loss, but when you look at not only the -- what does weight loss really provide, there's over 200 complications associated with living with obesity. And as we get more and closer to the marketplace and look at our modeling, we do think that this is going to relieve and reduce the risk of complications associated with obesity, and there will be medical cost savings associated with using these agents, which will, I think, be of great societal value. Also, when you look at the quality of life results that we saw from SURMOUNT-1, they were remarkable. And at times, it's hard to quantify those in a cost-effectiveness model. But in real life, those impact patients significantly. And I think it really does highlight how important these treatments are to people who live with obesity. And so I think as you look at the impact not at like a population level but on a patient level, these agents on tirzepatide will provide great value to society. Yes. On the commercial side, as we launch into the chronic weight management market for tirzepatide, we'll be very upfront with payers and health care professionals and consumers that this is a chronic disease and a chronic medication that needs to be adhered to long term. When you look at how this product works, one of the most important aspects of it is that it controls and reduces appetite. When someone tries to gain -- to lose weight via diet and exercise, as someone is successful in losing weight, the body actually works against that and tugs it the opposite way by increasing the appetite. That's why these agents, tirzepatide does work because it does reduce the appetite. So while on therapy, we anticipate that the appetite will be lowered and maintained. And then if stopped, then the appetite will increase. Now this is something that unlike most drugs, you don't know if you stop taking like a statin or something else, you don't really feel any effects. We do think that, that will be a noticeable effect that will begin soon after stopping therapy even before you start seeing weight gain. So I think we think that will be an important kind of signal for a patient to understand that this is a chronic disease and needs to be treated long term. As it goes into the -- maybe 1 other aspect on the additional indications, we talk a lot about access and the need for in order to get access into Part D. And obviously, that will be an important thing overarching. But these additional indications are important for the senior population. Complications run with living with obesity, and they emerge into complications when you reach Medicare like type 2 diabetes, like sleep apnea and like heart failure. And so we believe these are important indications to study because we think these are important health conditions. But also commercially, we think this is important because this will help us get access for these really important complications that are really important to the senior population. So commercially, we think these are really important. Thanks for the question. Yes. No, good question. I mean, on net pricing, we have 1 price point for Mounjaro. We have flat pricing across the dosing form so people can feel free to find the right dose that works for them at the same price. That will be the same price for new starts, it is for people on maintenance to treatment."

            "content": "Thanks, Joe. We're off to a strong start in 2023 with volume-driven revenue growth led by our incretin portfolio, Verzenio and Jardiance. At our Q1 earnings last year, we shared exciting data from SURMOUNT-1, the first of our tirzepatide obesity Phase III trials. Today, we're excited to share the positive top line results for the SURMOUNT-2 Phase III trial for tirzepatide, which examine the safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in chronic weight management in a type 2 diabetes population. SURMOUNT-1 set a new bar for weight loss possible from a pharmacologic agent in non-type 2 diabetes population with obesity or overweight in a Phase III trial. And SURMOUNT-2 does the same in the type 2 diabetes population. Before discussing our financial results and pipeline updates, I'd like to also note the actions Lilly announced on March 1 to improve insulin affordability in the United States. We are proud to have led these efforts to make it easier for people to access Lilly insulin, including through the broad implementation of our $35 out-of-pocket cap and a significant reduction in list price for most of our most commonly used insulins. That said, there remains substantial opportunity and need to reduce existing systemic barriers to insulin access and affordability. Bringing affordable insulin to those who need it will require action and engagement by all stakeholders in our health system. But together, we can create real change to improve access and affordability for people who use insulin. Moving to our results. You can see this on Slide 4 that the progress we've made on our strategic deliverables so far this year. Q1 revenue, which includes sales of COVID-19 antibodies -- sorry, excluding sales from COVID-19 antibodies grew 10% or 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by volume growth of 18%. Volume growth in Q1 was underpinned by Mounjaro, which is leading the new product category, which also includes Jaypirca, and we expect it will include additional products in the months and years to come. The new product and growth product classifications represent an evolution from our prior designation of key growth products. We believe that these classifications will help investors see the performance of both our newest products in addition to those with ongoing growth potential. In the first quarter of this year, the new product category contributed $574 million of revenue, and the new product and growth product categories combined to contribute 20 percentage points of volume growth in Q1. These products as well as expecting -- expected upcoming product launches reinforce our belief in the strength of Lilly's growth outlook throughout this decade. Last Monday, we broke ground at the site of our two new manufacturing facilities in Boone County, Indiana. We also announced a further $1.6 billion investment in addition to the previously announced $2.1 billion investment in this project to expand Lilly's manufacturing network for active ingredients and new therapeutic modalities. And our progress continues as planned towards production starting later this year at our Research Triangle Park site in North Carolina. On the business development front, this past week, we entered into agreements to sell the rights of our olanzapine portfolio, including Zyprexa and the rights to These two transactions will enable us to further focus our time and effort on our next-generation medicines. In our pipeline, we've had several important updates since our Q4 earnings call, including label expansion for Verzenio in advanced breast cancer in the U.S.; for mirikizumab approval in Japan and a positive CHMP opinion in the EU as well as the FDA's issuance of a Complete Response Letter in the United States; regulatory submissions in the EU for tirzepatide for chronic weight management and in Japan for lebrikizumab for atopic dermatitis; and a positive Phase III top line readout for SURMOUNT-2, the second global study evaluating tirzepatide for adults living with obesity or overweight, which will enable completion of our rolling submission with the FDA under Fast Track designation. Dan will discuss this further, but we are excited with the top line results of the Phase III SURMOUNT-2 trial. As shared late last year, we received Fast Track designation from the FDA and initiated a rolling submission for tirzepatide in chronic weight management based on the results of the SURMOUNT-1 trial. And we aligned with the FDA that completion of the submission would come following the SURMOUNT-2 readout. We anticipate completing our submission to the FDA in the coming weeks. We believe addressing obesity could make an enormous difference in millions of people's lives, significantly impact public health and reduce health care costs. We are encouraged by this important next step in the journey to redefine obesity care. Finally, this quarter, we distributed $1 billion in dividends and completed $750 million in share repurchases. On Slide five, you'll see a list of key events since our Q4 earnings call, including several important regulatory, clinical and other updates we are discussing today. Now I'll turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 results. Thank you, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress to start the year. Our core business, which excludes COVID-19 antibody revenue, grew 10%, driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio, Trulicity and Jardiance. This growth was achieved despite headwinds related to pricing, to generic erosion of Alimta in the U.S. and a moderated but still negative foreign exchange impacts. In the coming quarters, we expect the impact of COVID-19 antibody revenue in the prior periods will ebb, while our new product and growth product categories of medicines will drive continued revenue growth and meaningful operating margin expansion. While the quarter was not without some challenges, which I am confident we'll overcome, we made meaningful advances in our pipeline, including the approval of an expanded label of Verzenio, the first approval of mirikizumab in Japan, submission of tirzepatide for obesity in the EU and positive results from our second Phase III trial for tirzepatide in obesity. We also demonstrated leadership to improve insulin access and affordability for millions of Americans. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to both executing on the significant opportunities before us and to continuing the important and often difficult work to discover, develop and bring to market innovative medicines to address some of the greatest areas of unmet medical need. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Thanks, Terence. I'll go to Mike for those questions on branding strategy considerations and then any update on RTP. Thanks, Chris, for the 2-parter there. Mike, we'll go to you for the first part around bigger picture in the incretin market and category growth and how we're thinking about that and then the second round, use in patients with diabetes versus none. Okay. Mike, you can go ahead and cover these points kind of general gross to net thoughts and trends and then Colin's question about potential use of a priority review voucher. Thanks, Evan, for the question. Mike, we'll go back to you balancing commercial potential with potential stress to the system. Thoughts? Yes. Maybe just to add, I think the latest data from the Medicare Trust is that we're spending about $1 trillion a year as a country on obesity-related complications and comorbidities. I don't think we always do a very good job of thinking about buying pharmaceuticals as an investment and future savings in our health. Maybe we do better when it's acute like COVID. I think we spent tens of billions on COVID therapies and didn't question it as much. But here's -- I think even in the most rosy forecast, we're not going to sell $1 trillion of obesity drugs. So the question is more like, over time, can we demonstrate that treatment today reduces cost downstream? We're highly confident that, that will be a multiple of 5x, 10x savings for whatever people invest in the medicines. We have to prove that. That's our job as an innovative company is to do the outcome studies that demonstrate that. I think our competitors are doing the same thing, and that will be good for the field. And as I've said before, it's hard to imagine by the end of this decade that everyone doesn't just accept that pharmacologic treatment for overweight and obesity should be the standard of care, and it will save this health care system trillions of dollars over time. So that's our position and we need to fight for that position. We also need to do the work. And right now, we are talking about weight loss numbers, not outcomes. But that data is coming soon, as early as next year for tirzepatide. Thanks, Chris. That's a lot to unpack in the question, but I'll hand over to Dan for some commentary on TB6. Thanks, Mike. I'm sorry. Thanks, Umer. I'll maybe go to Mike for the kind of question about net pricing on Mounjaro and how that might evolve and then also on general commentary around if Ozempic is in the IRA basket, what might the impact be to others. Mike? Yes. And if I got your question right and just to clarify, it's not clear to us that semaglutide and dulaglutide will be eligible in the same year for IRA, if they're eligible, depending on sales two years prior in the various ways the government is proposing to do this. But let's just play it out if sema is selected because it's a small molecule 9 years from launch, et cetera. What will happen in the commercial market? Nobody knows because in the draft guidance, there really isn't a lot of clarity about how the government proposes to effectuate the so-called maximum fair price to the consumer level. They're entertaining a few ideas, it appears, from their initial guidance. I think we're expecting more regulatory, either definitive regulatory statements or proposals for comment in the coming 90 days, Umer. But I can tell you what we'd prefer is that since we're not a party to that transaction as manufacturers in this example, not us, but someone else, we would probably need a third party to determine, is that a valid Part D prescription? Is it eligible for the maximum fair price? And then to step in and match that transaction up post hoc. We did something like that when the donut hole was created, and it worked pretty well with third-party administrators. This is what we've suggested that the administration will be the best thing. And in that scenario, you would not have a wholesale price reduction to reach the maximum fair price. You would do it after the fact, and I think in that way, be able to keep the two segments, commercial and government a little bit more separate. That has obvious advantage for the industry and probably for payers as well and maybe for patients, creating certainty and lack of arbitrage across physical distribution channels. So to be determined there, but as that detail comes out, we'll have more commentary on it, but ball's in the government's court now. Thanks, Tim, for the really good question. I'll hand over to Ilya Yuffa, our President of Lilly International to weigh in on that. Thanks, Steve, for the question. I'll hand over to Jake Van Naarden to weigh in on the opportunity. Thanks, Steve. I'll hand over to Dan for a quick update. Maybe in the interest of time, since we have just a couple of minutes, let's focus on the first question, and we can connect with IR on the second questions afterwards. So mirikizumab update, I hand over to Patrick for that."

We frankly thought it would be positive actually at the last interim analysis at the end of last year. Just by way of reminder, we studied Verzenio in the adjuvant setting, given for two years, specifically in a high-risk population, which is a population that we and I think physicians agree is the 1 that really requires intensification of therapy. And now Verzenio is the standard of care in that setting. We don't really expect that to change actually. We have mature follow-up on our data as last presented at San Antonio in December. We have a Category 1 NCCN listing for Verzenio in the setting. I think Verzenio's role in high-risk adjuvant endocrine positive breast cancer is pretty clear. We seem to hear a lot of noise about ribociclib in intermediate risk population, a population that we didn't study, a population for whom I think the risk benefit is a little bit more questionable. And to the extent that the data we see at ASCO provides a role for that drug in that setting, sure. That's fine. That really doesn't pose any threat to the forecasted opportunity for Verzenio in the high-risk setting where we still remain very confident in its prospects."

We already see significant utilization of current therapies that don't provide as much weight loss and benefit and still providing significant commercial opportunity and also access to patients. A lot of that is happening in many markets out of pocket. At the same time, there are markets that are already moving towards reimbursement, U.K. and other markets in Europe, already looking at ways to reimburse, especially in the higher BMI categories of obesity. And so this will play out over time on both as we look at data and outcomes to drive further an expansion of access. And also, we do foresee a significant out-of-pocket market in many countries, including Asia, South America and Europe as well. And so I think you'll see that grow over time, but significant opportunity to take a look at the total population globally that is obese, overweight, there's a significant opportunity outside of the U.S. for chronic weight management, and we'll look to invest in expanding that both the introduction of Mounjaro tirzepatide in chronic weight management but also improving access over time."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q3 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Lucas Montarce, Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA. We're also joined by Susan Hedglin, Michala Irons, Mike Sprengnether and Lauren Zierke of the IR team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Joe. In Q3, Lilly continued to make progress across the business. We delivered strong revenue growth. We advanced and expanded our pipeline and we invested in new product launches and continued expanding manufacturing network. On Slide 5, you can see details of our financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, which we divested in Q3 2023. New product revenue grew by over $3 billion led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound has been strong and continues to grow as we expand both access and supply. U.S. sequential quarter-over-quarter prescription volume growth was 25% in Q3. All doses are available for order from Lilly in both the wholesale channel and LillyDirect Pharmacy Solutions. The launch of a single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect's self-pay channel further expanded supply and access in the quarter. And finally, we remain on-track to exceed the production target of at least 1.5 times the saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We continue to see strong performance across the balance of our portfolio in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, the non-incretin growth of the company was 17% in Q3. We achieved several key pipeline milestones this quarter, including the approval of Ebglyss in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The approval of Kisunla in Japan and Great Britain for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Disclosure of positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight. And the recent presentation of positive data from the Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 study, evaluating different dosing regimens for donanemab. Our manufacturing expansion agenda remains a top priority. In September, we invested nearly $2 billion to increase our manufacturing footprint in Ireland. This brings the total commitments to build, upgrade and acquire manufacturing facilities announced since 2020 to more than $20 billion. And beyond this $20 billion commitment, we also announced a separate $4.5 billion investment to develop the Lilly Medicine Foundry. This first-of-its-kind facility will be dedicated to research and development for manufacturing process design and to develop high-quality investigational medicines for our clinical trials. It will be located in Lebanon, Indiana, a short drive from the corporate headquarters. This investment underscores our confidence in our pipeline and the urgency we bring to bring our innovative medicines to patients around the world. In August, we closed the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics, adding oral integrin assets to our early phase immunology portfolio. And lastly, we returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. On Slide 6, you'll see key events since our Q2 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other key updates. Last month, we appointed Lucas Montarce as Lilly's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lucas has 23 years of experience at Lilly and has worked with the executive team and the Board for a long time. So congratulations, Lucas. Now, let me turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q3 financial results and provide an update on our 2024 financial guidance.\nLucas Montarce: Thanks, Dave. The Slide 7 summarizes our financial performance in the third quarter, which is highlighted by strong revenue growth across our new products as well as our non-incretin medicines. As Dave mentioned, revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from our non-incretin portfolio grew 17% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 82.2%. Gross margin primarily benefited from favorable product mix and higher realized prices, partially offset by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio in Q3 2023 and higher manufacturing costs. R&D expenses increased 13%, driven by continued investment in both our early and late-stage portfolio. We recognized $2.8 billion of acquired IPR&D charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches. Operating income increased to nearly $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expenses growth. The effective tax rate was 37.6%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. Other than the impact of acquired IPR&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously provided guidance. We delivered earnings per share of $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023. And this includes a negative impact of $3.08 from acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 46% with volume growing 35% driven by Zepbound Mounjaro and partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 11% in the U.S., primarily driven by Trulicity, Humalog and Verzenio. While Mounjaro and Zepbound demand remains strong and growing, quarter-by-quarter revenue growth in 2024 has been impacted by supply and channel dynamics. As we highlighted in Q2, increase in supply led to higher shipments that allow us to fulfill the majority of wholesalers back orders, serving as a tailwind to sales. In Q3, we saw channel inventory decreased as wholesalers continued to navigate the complexities of high-volume cold-chain products across a dozen different dose and brand combinations. We estimate this inventory decrease impacted Q3 sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound by mid-single digits as a percentage of aggregate used sales of these products. Europe revenue grew 39% in constant currency when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. This growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. We continue to be pleased with the Mounjaro equipment launches in Europe and are now launched in the U.K., Germany, Spain, and most recently Italy. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 45% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance. Moving to China, revenue increased 17% in constant currency. This increase was driven by volume growth of Tyvyt and favorable pricing impacts for Humalog. Finally, Japan grew 17% in revenue in constant currency. Volume growth of 20% was driven by uptick of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The Slide 10 provides additional perspective of performance across our product categories. Mounjaro sales were $3.1 billion globally, with almost $2.4 billion of net sales in the U.S. We continue to see solid uptake of Mounjaro outside the U.S. with sales in Q3 totaling $728 million. Verzenio continued its growth trajectory with worldwide sales increasing 32%, driven by strong execution in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $81 million. When excluding the impact of Japan collaboration milestones recognized in Q2, Jaypirca continued its sequential quarter-over-quarter growth trend, demonstrating sustained uptake in both the MCL and CLL patient population. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $41 million. We are pleased with our progress gaining commercial access for Omvoh in the U.S. As of January 2025, we will have first-line access at two out-of-the three major PBMs. We were also excited to receive U.S. approval for Kisunla and Ebglyss in Q3. The Kisunla launch is underway and progressing, and the Ebglyss launch began early this month. We are pleased to have already secured formulary access for Ebglyss with one of the major PBMs. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 22%, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. The Slide 11 provides an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We continue to see strong growth trends leading to sales of over $1.2 billion. We have broad formulary coverage for Zepbound. As of October 1, Zepbound has approximately 87% access in the commercial segment, and we are making ongoing progress expanding our employer opt-ins. We are in the early days of launching single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect. 2.5 milligram and 5-milligram single-dose vials are currently available to self-pay patient at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of other incretin medicines for obesity. This offering helps even more adults living with obesity access Zepbound including Medicare beneficiaries and those without them. Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. On Slide 13, you can see our updated guidance for the full year. We are updating our revenue guidance range to $45.4 billion to $46 billion. The new midpoint range represents approximately 50% growth in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, demonstrating a continuation of revenue growth acceleration. We are investing heavily in increasing supply of tirzepatide and have been carefully balancing our demand creation activities and launches into new markets with our production to support continuity of care for patients. In Q3, we continued to be prudent scaling up and demand-generation activities. This is the driver for lowering the top end of the range. We continue to expect that we will exceed our goals to increase production of incretin saleable doses by at least 50% in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Now with all the doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound available, we will accelerate demand activities and while there is a lag to flow-through revenue, we expect to see the impact of these efforts in Q2 and into 2025. Lastly, we also expect new Mounjaro launches internationally to contribute to growing in Q4. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue remains unchanged on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Other income and expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $325 million of expense on a reported basis and is unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. We have updated our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, driven by the impact of non-deductible IPR&D in Q3. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $12.05 to $12.55 on a reported basis and $13.02 to $13.52 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect the updated mentioned earlier, as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q3 of approximately $3.1 billion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Lucas. Lilly R&D had another productive quarter. So let me begin by sharing some late-phase updates, including some exciting Phase 3 data that we shared at recent medical congresses. Starting with neuroscience. Yesterday, at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease Conference, we are pleased to share positive results from our Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 trial, which evaluated different dosing regimens for initiation of donanemab treatments to understand their effect on ARIA-E. In this trial, we tested a modified titration, which shifted one vial of donanemab from the first infusion to the third, as shown on Slide 14. We designed this modified titration to achieve identical total dose of donanemab administered in the first three months as does our standard dosing regimen, but we hypothesized that the smoother increase in dose could result in less ARIA. We are pleased to see in this trial that indeed by pharmacokinetic analysis, we achieved equivalent cumulative exposure between the modified titration and the standard dosing regimen. And as a result, we achieved similar levels of amyloid plaque removal and phospho-tau217 reduction. Importantly, we also confirmed our hypothesis on ARIA and showed that the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen. As well, lower frequency of symptomatic ARIA-E, lower radiographic severity of all categories of ARIA-E, and lower ARIA-E and ApoE 4 genotype carriers was observed using the modified titration as compared to the standard dosing regimen. We plan to submit a supplemental DLA to the FDA in the coming weeks for this modified titration. Our efforts on Remternetug continue to progress and we are starting a Phase 3 efficacy study of Remternetug focused on preclinical phase of the disease. Similar to our ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial for donanemab where we are trying to reduce the risk of progressions symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. In this upcoming Phase 3 registrational trial called TRAILRUNNER 3, we are evaluating a fixed duration of monthly subcutaneous administration of Remternetug, offering what we see as a potentially convenient option for this earlier patient population. We'll share more details about the study design of TRAILRUNNER 3 tomorrow at CTAD. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. Last month we shared data from our remaining Phase 3 studies for our weekly basal insulin called Insulin efsitora alfa. As a reminder, the efsitora Phase 3 consists of five global registration studies, four of which are in adults with Type-2 diabetes, and one is in adults with Type-1 diabetes. We are pleased that each study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior A1c reduction versus insulin glargine or insulin degludec, which are the most frequently used daily basal insulins. In the studies evaluating efsitora in people with Type-2 diabetes, the results demonstrated that efsitora achieved meaningful A1c reduction with relatively low hypoglycemia rates. We were particularly excited with the results for QWINT-1 in which efsitora was administered via six doses using a single-use autoinjector. In this 52-week study in people with Type-2 diabetes, efsitora lowered participants A1c by 1.31% compared to 1.27% for insulin glargine. This impressive A1c reduction was achieved in low hypoglycemia rates. Actually, efsitora had approximately 40% lower rates of severe or clinically significant hypoglycemia than the daily insulin glargine. These data highlight the power of an easier-to-use dose form of a weekly insulin for people who are just initiating basal insulin therapy for the first time. We look forward to discussing the results from the QWINT Phase 3 program with global regulatory agencies. It has also been a productive quarter for our late-phase incretin programs. First, as shown on Slide 15, we shared positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight, which demonstrated a remarkable 94% reduction in the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. This is the longest duration tirzepatide data to-date, and we are highly encouraged to see that patients on the 15-milligram dose achieved sustained weight loss of nearly 23% during the more than three-year treatment period and that this weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in risk of developing diabetes. We look forward to sharing the detailed results next week at ObesityWeek. These results add to compelling data showing the benefit of the combined pharmacology of dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism in several obesity-related complications, including Type-2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or MASH, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and heart failure. We are working quickly to bring tirzepatide to more adults living with obesity and its complications, and we are pleased to share that we expect U.S. regulatory action for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea yet this year. And that we will submit for U.S. approval for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction before the end of this year. Another avenue to advance patient care is the maintenance of body weight reductions. We are conducting two Phase 3b weight loss maintenance trials. The first is SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN, which compares either tirzepatide 5 milligrams or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose to placebo. The second is ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, which evaluates our oral GLP-1 orforglipron versus placebo after tirzepatide or semaglutide in participants who completed SURMOUNT-5, the 3b head-to-head study of tirzepatide versus semaglutide. We look forward to sharing the topline data readout for SURMOUNT-5 later this year. Next, in oncology. The Phase 3 EMBER-3 study evaluating our oral SERD, imlunestrant, in patients with second-line ER positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer was positive. The study evaluated three-arms, imlunestrant as a monotherapy, investigator's choice of endocrine therapy monotherapy, and imlunestrant in combination with abemaciclib. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA by year-end, and we look forward to sharing detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. The Phase 3 portion of the olomorasib first-line KRAS G12C lung cancer study is now underway. The first Phase 3 trial for this class of medicines in newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression. This comes after recently defining the dose of the medicine in combination with standard-of-care regimens in consultation with the FDA under Project Optimus. We continue to believe we could have a leading agent in this class and look forward to execution of the late-stage program. Finally, in immunology, we're excited by the recent U.S. FDA approval of lebrikizumab as Ebglyss for adults and children 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Ebglyss provides a new first-line biologic treatment that targets a main cause of eczema inflammation that offers significant early skin clearance and itch relief with convenient once-monthly maintenance dosing following the initial phase of treatment. We recently shared compelling long-term data showing that lebrikizumab provides sustained disease control for up to three years in more than 80% of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who responded to Ebglyss treatment at 15 weeks. We have also initiated two Phase 3 studies of lebrikizumab in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. As we continue to expand our immunology portfolio to help more patients, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies evaluating Ixekizumab and tirzepatide together in patients with obesity or overweight in either psoriatic arthritis or moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and can negatively impact disease outcomes. Taltz has already demonstrated strong efficacy in treating psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis and we are excited to see the potential for additional benefits for patients when combined with the significant and sustained weight loss offered by Zepbound. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28 and Slide 17 shows potential key events for the year. I've already covered our late-phase progress, so now I'll quickly cover updates for the early-phase pipeline. Starting again with neuroscience. We recently initiated a Phase 2 study of an epiregulin antibody in chronic neuropathic pain associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy. We had previously shown this molecule in Phase 1 of the pipeline as an undisclosed mechanism in pain. We also have begun Phase 1 studies on two new neurodegeneration assets, an alpha-synuclein directed siRNA and a tau-directed siRNA. Earlier this morning at CTAD, we disclosed detailed results from our Phase 2 study of Ceperognastat, our oral GlcNAcase anti-tau agent. While neither dose slowed clinical decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, biomarker data suggests potential impacts on tau pathology, brain volume and neuroinflammation. Safety follow-ups for the study are ongoing. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. In the coming days, we will initiate a Phase 2 study of Eloralintide, our long-acting amylin receptor agonist for chronic weight management in combination with tirzepatide in patients with Type-2 diabetes. And a Phase 2 study of Bimagrumab, alone or in combination with tirzepatide for chronic weight management in participants without Type-2 diabetes. We will also be advancing Volenrelaxin, our long-acting relaxin molecule into Phase 2 in adults with chronic kidney disease. We removed the Phase 1 APOC3 siRNA asset in cardiovascular disease as it did not meet our bar for continuing clinical development. In oncology, 2024 continues to be a very productive year for new clinical starts. Since the last call, we advanced three new molecules into Phase 1 studies. Our oral SMARCA2 or BRM inhibitor, our KRAS G12D inhibitor, and our Pan KRAS inhibitor. These three initiations bring the total new clinical starts in oncology in 2024 to seven, exceeding the goal we shared earlier this year to put at least five new potential medicines in the clinic. And we've done that across three different modalities, emblematic of our strategy to utilize therapeutic modality diversification to combat treatment resistance and improve patient outcomes. We expect this new slate of clinical programs will set us up for an exciting 2025 as we look to see which programs deliver differentiated and important early clinical datasets for patients. Finally, in early-stage immunology, we're also excited to initiate several new Phase 2 studies. First, we moved DC-853, an oral IL-17 inhibitor from the DICE Therapeutics acquisition into Phase 2 in adults with moderate-to-severe black psoriasis. And we removed DC-806 from the pipeline in favor of 853, which is a more potent molecule. Second, we are initiating a Phase 2 study combining Eltrekibart and Mirikizumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In addition, we are terminating the Phase 2b study of Peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis due to the overall benefit-risk profile of the molecule in this study. Finally, after welcoming our Morphic colleagues to Lilly in August, our pipeline now reflects the oral alpha 4-beta 7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 in Phase 2 for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Q3 was an exceptionally productive quarter for Lilly R&D, and we're pleased with our important progress we're making for patients across all of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before taking questions, let me briefly summarize our progress in the quarter. We had strong revenue growth across both Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as our oncology, immunology and neurosciences medicines. Significant advancements in our pipeline included approval of Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the U.S., Kisunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Japan and Great Britain, and positive data disclosures for Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide and donanemab. We are confident in Lilly's bright future. We have now launched in major geographies the cohort of medicines that we expect will serve as the driver of our growth through the balance of this decade. That is Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, Zepbound, Kisunla and Ebglyss. We expect these products, together with our already launched products will contribute to strong growth of the company in 2025. In addition, we plan to continue to scale R&D and step-up our investment across manufacturing and commercial to support the successful launches of these medicines to help even more patients next year. So now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate a Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and conclude our call in a timely manner. So consistent with prior quarters, we'll respond to one question per caller, so ask that you limit to one question per caller as we will end the call at 11 a.m. If you have more than one question, you can re-enter the queue and we'll get to your question if time allows. So Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A session and then we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris, your line is live.\nChris Schott: All right. Great. Thanks so much. Just to kick off the questions, can you just help bridge a bit from the 3Q sales we just saw reported to the 4Q implied results. It's obviously a substantial step up in sales. It sounds like part of this is you're now accelerating demand generation efforts given the improved capacity. But I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on exactly what those efforts are and how quickly you expect those programs can translate to an acceleration in prescriptions? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris, for the question. I'll maybe hand over to Patrik since I'm guessing a lot of the question is around tirzepatide related, but let Lucas jump in as needed. Patrik?\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Chris. I think it's first important to emphasize that the overall performance and health of both Mounjaro and Zepbound are very strong. And then we saw a slightly accelerated growth in Q3 of more than 25% and also the market, the underlying market for both Type-2 and obesity continues to grow. And we took a more prudent approach than we anticipated in Q3, pretty much driven by the need to deliver a good consumer experience. That has been one of our triggers for any investments based upon the experience we faced in the first half of the year when a lot of the calls of our customer service center was about supply, actually more than 20%. We are now down to less than 1% of those being supply-related. So what we are doing right now is that we are investing heavily in our DTC effort, which we haven't done in the past, whilst supply allows us to invest strongly there, but it's not a demand issue. And similarly, we are fully leaning in on all the HCP promotional efforts, also providing samples in the marketplace to providers. So we remain very confident based upon the underlying trend in the marketplace today and also the growth of both Zepbound and Mounjaro in terms of TRx, NBRx, and TRx that we are after a good Q4.\nLucas Montarce: Maybe just to add to that, thank you, Chris, for the question. When you look at the midpoint that I mentioned, 50% growth that we expect for the fourth quarter compared with the 42% is a step-up of 8%. When you remove the channel dynamics that we alluded in Q2, the step-up of growth is very consistent throughout the quarters. So the acceleration and the drivers are the ones that Patrik mentioned. Maybe just to add to that, OUS as well, we continue to advance or engage new countries that we are going to be launching Mounjaro as well that will drive that part of that growth acceleration in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks. Paul, next question?\nOperator: The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citigroup. Geoff, your line is live.\nGeoff Meacham: Hi guys, thanks for the question. I guess related to that, I just want to dig into the 3Q volatility. I mean, Dave, you mentioned the scrip demand sequentially. I guess -- so given that, why would you see such a big drawdown this quarter, I guess investors are trying to figure out if the sequential trends are perhaps a leading indicator of a moderation in demand or if it's just the lumpiness of the roll-out in excess? Thanks.\nJoe Fletcher: Dave, you want to fill that?\nDave Ricks: Yes, maybe because it's kind of a macro thing you're asking there. But I think first of all, there is a lot of lumpiness in channel stocking. I think all the sell-side analysts on this call have probably struggled with that as we have, exiting Q1, we can recall that we had a number of our dosage forms on back-order, and we pretty much reached a NATR of supply in the wholesalers. That was kind of restocked in Q2 and then we saw a drawdown in Q3. I think what we really don't control and don't attempt to, but as a reality is that downstream customers from Lilly, wholesalers and retailers, are making their own decisions about which of the 12 different dosage forms they want to stock and at what level. There are some physical constraints to that, cold-chain, capacity is constrained and their financial constraints, working capital that they're managing to. Those are their decisions to maintain their customer service levels. I think what we've done is sort of move our set point of how much stock we want to have on hand before we go initiate demand-stimulating activities, which we had more or less paused for Mounjaro in the first half and never started for Zepbound remembering we launched in December of last year. So I think the in-market data, you guys can all read, and you see Geoff yourself, and we do see acceleration of both brands in Q3 over Q2 in actual consumption. And our estimate is that will continue or accelerate as we add U.S. stimulation to that demand, which, as Patrik said, we're going to begin doing here really mid-November in earnest. And ex-U.S. demand is another factor that affects sales and that too we moved out launches by about a quarter just to make sure we had enough buffer. So when customers want a prescription, they could get it filled reliably. And I think that's an important thing for us to keep that trust going forward. So at a macro-level, is there a demand problem here? No, actually. Is there a supply problem? No, although if we had unlimited demand, there would be. So we're carefully gating those two things together. As we escalate supply in Q4, which, as I mentioned, we're going to beat the 50% growth number, you'll see us grow our demand stimulation as well. And I think that's really about Q4, but even more about Q1 of 2025 and continuing acceleration there. So business is super-healthy. We feel good about where we are. Obviously, there was some choppiness this quarter, but I think underlying growth here is as strong as we would have hoped.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. Paul, next question?\nOperator: The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital. Evan, your line is live.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi guys. Thank you so much for the question and Joe, congrats on your new job. I want to touch on compounding. Given the headlines, do you believe that compounded drugs are impacting demand? And secondarily, how do you frame kind of the FDA's waffling on the shortage list as it relates to compounding? It seems that this has been a hot button issue, I'd love your perspective. Thank you so much.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan. Yes, a hot topic indeed. Maybe in terms of talking about whether there's a financial impact we see that, I'll have Patrik feel that and then maybe the broader question around the FDA, I'll let Dave chime in. So Patrik?\nPatrik Jonsson: Well, thank you very much, Evan. I think as we all know, that is not one reliable source when it comes to quantifying the compounding market. We also know that it's opaque and mainly cash and there are probably reasons to believe that some of those patients are off label. So from our perspective, we actually don't estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business. But our major concern here has been driven by safety, but thousands of people in the U.S. are getting medicine that is not approved by the FDA for quality, safety or efficacy purposes. So that has been our concern, and we are mainly leaning in now, as we said earlier, to drive demand in the U.S. marketplace for patients with obesity and Type-2 diabetes.\nDave Ricks: Yes, I mean, I can't really speculate too much what's going through the FDA's mind, but I think other commentators have mentioned that the longer this goes on, the more risk they have to their own regulatory framework. And so, my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they want to win this case and they're putting their ducks in a row to do so. There is an alternate, I guess, perspective that they don't care, but I think they do care. The other thing I'll say is we work closely with the FDA to approve new capacities. And it's important to note here we could do more with them, and we communicate this to them directly. They're not hearing anything here. They haven't heard from you already, but we have invested massively in parenteral filling capacity and API capacity. And a big part of the delivery schedule for that, which can take 2.5 years to 4 years is actually the regulatory process itself. So it's difficult to think about a world where the workaround to that is to unleash unregulated product. The workaround should be to collaborate with the companies to speed up legitimate product delivery and we would embrace that discussion fully. We have a lot of things in queue now with the FDA or about to be that could speed up what already is an impressive production ramp, we would welcome that opportunity.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, both. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.\nSeamus Fernandez: Thanks. My question is actually on how you feel the compounding situation could be resolved by the availability of an oral small molecule that can be provided at substantial scale? It seems like this is the easiest and most straightforward answer to the compounding crisis. Once that occurs, does it make sense with that availability regardless of product that the agency would move to resolve the crisis? Or is this a product-by-product situation such that if Novo can't get their house in order in that context that we'll end-up with having this compounding issue just draw out over time? Thanks.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Seamus. Yes, I'll hand back to Dave, although I mean, if you're referring to our, of course, our oral GLP-1 non-peptide agonist orforglipron, I mean that's still a ways away from the Phase 3 turning over and then ultimately coming to-market. But Dave, maybe what would you add to your prior comments?\nDave Ricks: Yes. Well, I mean in the long run, of course, there's a potential 1 billion customers on the planet. And I think we've said, I've said that probably the only way that a big chunk of those are served well is with oral products because of the production system efficiencies there versus parenteral filling of proteins. So it's important. Of course, we're in the lead there and we want to see our orforglipron be successful, but we need the data and then submission and launch would put that sometime something like less than 2 years from now. But I wouldn't characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn't one for us. I think the problem is people are being harmed and duped, right? And so that's kind of what we'd like to see stop. But as Patrik said, we don't really see a financial impact on Lilly of compounding. I think that as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates this back to our generic world. But as I said, I think the FDA wants to stop that for good reasons, for public safety reasons and they'll do that. At the end of the day, FDAs use this as a product-by-product analysis. And right now, tirzepatide is not in shortage and therefore for mass compounding should not be permitted. There's a stay, etc. in the court, but we think that should be the state there. As it relates to semaglutide, you'll have to ask Novo that, although we're working hard to help Novo with their supply problem by reducing demand for semaglutide and increasing it for tirzepatide. So maybe it will resolve that way.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit, your line is live.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe if I can ask the demand question and supply question differently. So now you will be starting some demand generation activities in the later half of the year - later part of the year. How are you thinking about the access side of it, do you think that there is some convergence between access demand generation and supply into 2025 because we are hearing that some of the payers are restricting it even more now. So would love to understand your thoughts on access side given that you are probably have done the negotiations at this point?\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mohit. I'll hand over to Patrik to talk about maybe access updates and go forward.\nPatrik Jonsson: Yes. Maybe just a few comments on Mounjaro. Prior to moving into Zepbound, I think with Mounjaro, we have really good access and it's 93% and I think pretty much where we need to be across commercial and Medicare. In terms of Zepbound, I think we've made progress in record time here, close to 90% commercial access and we continue to see improvement in terms of employers opting. You're correct, we heard stories about some employers opting out, but the major trend is actually in favor of opting-in to the anti-obesity medications. So we are definitely north of the 50% and I think we will have some new data in the first part of 2026 since both the employers are making those decisions effective one-one in the new year to come. So I think we are very, very optimistic in that part of our business, but we're also continuing to make progress in terms of access for Medicaid. And just since we connected last time, we have gained six incremental states for Medicaid and most recently effective 10-1, we have California and Massachusetts. So big states are now covering more than 30 million lives, and we expect to continue to make progress in that space. And lastly, I would just emphasize the potential approval here of obstructive sleep apnea. The approval of obstructive sleep apnea will help us with employer opt-in because we know that outcome studies are critical to convince employers. But on top of that, it also opens up the door for access in Medicare, and with the decision that CMS announced back in April this year, we are confident that we will gain access also for OSA in Medicare. So I think we have many reasons to be excited about the outlook for 2025, driven by improved access across the commercial America space as well as the investments we have done, we believe to be direct.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Patrik. And Mohit, even though you didn't ask about OUS access, and I don't allow multipart questions, maybe I'll see if Ilya wants to chime in and talk a little bit about OUS access progress to-date and what we see going forward. Ilya, do you want to -- would you like to chime in on that?\nIlya Yuffa: Sure. Overall, we have seen significant progress on our launches OUS. We have both access for Type-2 diabetes where in some of the markets like U.K., Germany and Japan, and we're seeing some good progression of our share in those markets where we're already seeing leading share of market in new patient starts in those places. Of course, we need to continue to develop access in other markets. And then on the chronically management side, we feel good about the prospects of adding countries to drive access. At the same time, there's also developed self-pay markets like the U.K., UAE and Saudi, where we're already seeing significant progression of our share and penetration where we actually have leading share of market in TRx in these markets. And we continue to focus on both developing the self-pay, but also increasing access for both Type-2 diabetes and chronic weight management over time. And that will be gradual as we enter new markets.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Ilya. Paul, next question.\nOperator: Next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, your line is live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering I know you've already framed out kind of where supply would be for the second half of this year. Again, as we look out to 2025, can you give us an early read on how your supply capacity efforts have been progressing and how we should think about the amount of new capacity, especially on the auto-injector side that you can bring on for 2025? Thank you.\nDave Ricks: I can start, let me just jump in. I mean, we will have a chance to lay out that as we did this year in our guidance call in early February. But qualitatively, you can see the flow of our investment and CapEx into this space and you could kind of go backwards three years or so and expect the capacities we announced then to be coming on full line in that timeframe and then rolling that forward. So of course, we made an announcement this year and those are a couple of years away from having full impact. But if you go back to '21, '22, '23, we are working hard to bring those online and expect good growth next year. So I think Lucas mentioned, we're seeing acceleration in demand, but that means acceleration in supply during this year and we expect strong growth on the total for next year and we'll lay out the details if we get into the guide call. If you have anything else to add to that, Lucas?\nLucas Montarce: Maybe just say one comment from my side. When we talk about more so from the demand perspective, I think in the U.S. in particular, the proxy that we alluded to on the growth that we see across both and Mounjaro and Zepbound in TRx of that 25% sequential quarter-on-quarter is a good proxy to start basically trending out into next year, more so to provide more perspective from the market side and the demand side than the manufacturer.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, both. Paul, next question?\nOperator: Next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore ISI. Umer, your line is live.\nUmer Raffat: Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to spend one more minute on the inventory dynamic in the quarter. I'm trying to think out loud, could the launch of cash-pay single vial option via LillyDirect have impacted channels' interest in filling out their inventory given how those launch is going? And/or were there any changes in your incentives or fees to the distributors that could have impacted it? Thank you very much.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks. I'll let Patrik quickly handle that.\nPatrik Jonsson: Well, overall, we launched LillyDirect self-pay by just a month ago. Not we are pleased with the uptake, but we also realized that it takes some time for healthcare system to adopt the self-pay in their EMR systems. But so far, I would say that the impact of TRx has been quite limited and would be defined as being at the low-single to single-digit level. We expect Lilly Direct self-pay though to be a very important channel to grow new therapy starts moving forward, but not significant in Q3.\nDave Ricks: I think the short answer to both the question is no and no. We didn't change our terms, and I don't think we've seen any change in retail stocking of the auto-injector because the vials are filled.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Umer. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your line is live.\nSteve Scala: Thank you so much. For a product with a seemingly unlimited market opportunity, what appears to be great market awareness and persistent supply shortages, DTC for Zepbound really shouldn't be necessary, particularly now. DTC, in my experience usually signals concern about patient volumes, awareness or competition. So the question is, if DTC were not instituted, what would be the trajectory of Zepbound over the next, say, 12 months would consensus be achieved? And if competition is the concern, are you getting ahead of CagriSema data due out soon? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: That's a lot to unpack, Steve. I don't think we're going to speculate around a hypothetical demand curve, but maybe -- I think Patrik kind of touched on this in his first answer on DTC. With regard to why we're doing DTC now, maybe just reiterate that point very briefly, Patrik, around.\nPatrik Jonsson: Yes, you know, I think we are comparing a very different market, the first half of '25 versus the second half of 2025. We faced some significant supply constraints, and it wouldn't be responsible for us at that point in time to drive any major DTC investments and just provide consumers with a bad experience at the pharmacy level. We have much more confidence now in terms of the supply moving forward. And this is not a demand issue problem. It's actually just a supply opportunity and we want to drive up that consumer awareness. So while we're doing extremely well, we just need to have in mind that the penetration in terms of obesity is just at the low single-digit level, 4% to 5% and there is still a huge stigma. So what we can do here to drive patient activation is going to serve us very well moving forward.\nDave Ricks: I would just add that actually unaided awareness for Zepbound, although we're -- everyone on this call is highly aware of the brand-name is actually not very hot, and then we launched this drug almost a year ago and have done no advertising. So I think it is time to introduce the brand and so people are aware of that when they speak to their doctor.\nJoe Fletcher: Great. Thank you. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink. Dave, your line is live.\nDavid Risinger: Yes, thanks very much. A number of my questions have been asked. So with respect to peresolimab, I'm hoping that you could just provide a little bit more color. You mentioned that it was dropped due to the benefit-risk ratio, but do you see any specific safety problems? And what is your view of the opportunity to develop another PD-1 agonist for INI disease in the future? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. And I was getting worried that Dan wouldn't get a chance to speak in the Q&A. So maybe I'll hand this over to Dan for his thoughts.\nDan Skovronsky: Good. Thanks for your concern, Joe. Thanks for your good question, Dave. Yes, I mean peresolimab is a really interesting mechanism for us and we were excited when we saw the Phase 2a data. It was a small number of patients, but had a relatively profound effect on RA symptoms, particularly in patients who had failed the previous biologics. So we sought out to replicate that in a larger Phase 2b study. Unfortunately, when we came to the end of that study, the benefit-risk that we've seen in the Phase 2a study was not fully borne out in Phase 2b. So just based on the overall profile, which includes both the efficacy and the safety of the drug, we decided not to pursue that. As to your question on a follow-on PD-1 agonist, we don't have one that we're pursuing right now. So that's I'll say about that. And I think, of course, we'll look forward to presenting the full data package at a future meeting. Thanks Joe.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dan. Paul, next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.\nKerry Holford: Thank you very much. Kerry Holford, Berenberg. My question actually on Verzenio, please. So your competitor in this space, Novartis, Kisqali recently received a broad approval in early breast cancer, which obviously includes the high-risk patient group. So I would just be interested to hear you speak about your expectations for market-share evolution in that space, how you protect your position with Verzenio in the high-risk setting? And then also if you can talk to the impact of IRA that you expect on that brand as we move through Part D reform next year and whether or not you expect the drug to be on the negotiation list for 2027? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry. Sort of a two-part question, but I'm excited to ask Jake to chime in and maybe talk about on Verzenio, potential Kisqali impact as well as IRA. Jake?\nJacob Van Naarden: Yes, happy to take it. Thanks for the question. Our position and expectation here around market share with respect to the adjuvant setting for Verzenio versus Kisqali hasn't really changed sort of pre-approval versus now. I think we have a very robust clinical data package with a lot of follow-up on our dataset, which is critically important for prescribers and a 2-year regimen where patients can finish their adjuvant therapy and move on with their life, hopefully remaining recurrence-free. That's a pretty compelling proposition. It has been, and I think is recognized as such in a variety of treatment guidelines that for the high-risk population, the monarchE patient population prefer Verzenio over Kisqali as standard-of-care. Those expert guidelines have weighed in over the past couple of months. I don't expect that to change materially. Of course, with a new market entrant, the percentage of patients in the setting who get any CDK4/6 inhibitor as adjuvant therapy could go up and that would benefit us and I expect that there will be some patients for whom Kisqali is a more appropriate choice, but I don't expect it to be a significant shift in our overall market dynamics. And of course, the node-negative population is not where we're indicated and not where we're used and that's a story for them to tell. On the second part of your question around Part D reform, it will have an impact. Of course, there's a push and pull here on the amount we have to contribute for catastrophic coverage being a downside, and of course, the co-pay cap, out-of-pocket cap on patients, and particularly in Medicare where that could be a tailwind on the brand. I think it's hard to know exactly where that will net out. It probably nets out sort of in the neutral range. I don't think it will end up being a headwind or a tailwind sort of in totality, but we have to see how that shakes out. On the last part of your question around negotiation list, I don't want to speculate on that. I don't think we have enough information yet given the evolving nature of all of the different medicines that could be up for negotiation to actually say one way or another, which ones will be there just yet.\nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Jake. I know we're running short on time. So, Paul, maybe just two or three more questions. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris, your line is live.\nChris Shibutani: Great. Thank you very much. Lucas, welcome to these calls. Just curious, there's a little bit of a tension point between the thought of what the operating margins and I know Lilly uses a very unique and specific precise calculus for that. With most people longer-term forecasting at least amongst the sell-side approaching high 40s percent. And I believe some of your commentary suggested that perhaps that would not be where you would aim for. Can you just maybe clarify for us your view, your take on where you think the operating margin trajectory would go under your purview?\nJoe Fletcher: Well, Lucas, go ahead.\nLucas Montarce: Yes. Sorry. Thank you, Chris, for your question and thank you for quoting me about this new ratio, the gross margin minus OpEx divided by revenue is quite a lengthy ratio. But just going to your question in the short run you see that we have grown our ratio in the last few quarters as we have been having this cycle of significant growth trajectory and we are starting to ramp up our investment both in SG&A and R&D. That effect will continue for sure for getting into the fourth quarter of the year that is including as part of our guidance. And what we expect to see moving into 2025, going into your question is we do expect to ramp up our demand generation activities in SG&A that will pay down into 2025, as well as we will scale our R&D. We talk about some of the assets on our portfolio that moves into Phase 2 and Phase 3 that will continue to play-out as we ramp-up those investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. So, I would expect that in the short term, we continue to see some operating margin expansion on this ratio. In long term, again, we will continue to expand and drive sustainable growth that will basically justify the investments that we do in SG&A and R&D.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Lucas. Next question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung, your line is live.\nTrung Huynh: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So in your PR, you note favorable changes to estimates for rebates and discounts for Mounjaro. If you axe on our numbers, if you axe-out mid-single-digit destock, it does look like price has gone up for the year for that product. Also, Zepbound pricing looks pretty stable. So perhaps can you just talk about what you see in pricing evolution for the rest of the year, but also next year as you'll have potentially sleep apnea and have that on the label, which may mean that you go into more government settings? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher: Lucas, would you like to talk kind of high-level and any net pricing dynamics worth sharing?\nLucas Montarce: Yes, sure. And thank you for the questions. Going back to the Mounjaro so far in the year, we kind of signaled throughout the year that once we were sunsetting last year, the co-pay program that we had that we will see that basically tailwind on the price year-on-year comparison that played out as what we expected. And the sunset, of course, takes again a little bit of time to see that playing out. So you see a little bit of that spillover effect getting into Q3. Getting into Q4, we don't expect to see major dynamics on that. And what you're starting to see basically in Q3 is what we project into the fourth quarter of the year. Maybe getting into the obstructive sleep apnea indication, any comments that you would like to add, Patrik, on that front?\nPatrik Jonsson: I would just say in terms of Zepbound, we are still very early on in launch. And I think you clarified the stability in pricing Q3 over Q2, look out. And what we need to have in mind is that we will continue to increase access. We will see launches outside of U.S. as well now with Zepbound being approved and also can impact the global net pricing dynamics moving forward.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, both. Maybe last question, Paul, and then we'll wrap up.\nOperator: Yes. The final question today will be from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live.\nCourtney Breen: Hi, there. Thank you so much for the question and for squeezing me in. Coming back to obesity and perhaps looking a little longer-term, you spoke to the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial off the back of SURMOUNT-5. I note that for orforglipron, this is placebo-controlled. And so, I just wanted to kind of get your thoughts on kind of that being the comparator. For us kind of that being the comparator suggests that this is about kind of duration of treatment, expansion to patients, which would really be an expansion of the total market rather than kind of displacement of necessarily another obesity product. Can you just talk a little bit about orforglipron kind of the future of how this could expand the market?\nJoe Fletcher: Yes. Thanks, Courtney, for the question on orfo. Maybe I'll hand to Patrik to talk about that and some of the commercial -- potential commercial strategy in ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial. Thank you for noticing that. Patrik, would you?\nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Courtney. But we are looking forward to the readouts of the orfo Phase 3 trials next year 2025. But I think overall, we see a significant opportunity here. It's going to be the first oral if we deliver along the lines as we saw in Phase 2 with an efficacy along the lines of an injectable along the lines of semaglutide. So I think that will really position us to scale globally. We are avoiding the cold-chain requirements, etc. But also in the U.S., we see an opportunity to further penetrate because we know that even if the experience with the auto-injector, once you have tried it is really good. We know that there is a need there in the marketplace that probably impacts 20% to 25% of the population. So I think there is a huge opportunity to expand. And when you refer particularly to be ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, I think there is an obligation on our side to really better understand how can you best keep patients on treatment for a longer period of time knowing that obesity is a chronic disease. That's why we're leaning in on some of MAINTAIN to see what is the lowest efficacious dose that you can keep patients on during a longer time. And similarly, with ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, we don't expect a major shift led by clinicians from injectables to orals. But I think this is one alternative to continue to treat patients for the periods they need to be on medication, which is a chronic disease, and we are doing whatever we can to improve adherence and improve patients outcomes.\nJoe Fletcher: Great. All right. Thank you, Patrik, and I think we're wrapping up, Dave.\nA - Dave Ricks: Okay. Great. Well, thanks for joining us today, everyone. I want to end the call by just thanking Joe Fletcher, who is moving on from his role as Head of IR to a new role, a critical role of CFO Manufacturing. I think you'll all agree, Joe did a great job in representing Lilly to the Street over the last many years. And we welcome Mike Czapar into the role, returning to IR actually after various rotations in the business and it will be an exciting time ahead with Mike as your main point of contact. So thank you all for joining us today. And as usual, if you have follow-up questions, please give us a call at the IR team and look forward to seeing everyone on the road over the coming months. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our conference for today.

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Joe. In Q3, Lilly continued to make progress across the business. We delivered strong revenue growth. We advanced and expanded our pipeline and we invested in new product launches and continued expanding manufacturing network. On Slide 5, you can see details of our financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, which we divested in Q3 2023. New product revenue grew by over $3 billion led by Mounjaro and Zepbound. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound has been strong and continues to grow as we expand both access and supply. U.S. sequential quarter-over-quarter prescription volume growth was 25% in Q3. All doses are available for order from Lilly in both the wholesale channel and LillyDirect Pharmacy Solutions. The launch of a single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect's self-pay channel further expanded supply and access in the quarter. And finally, we remain on-track to exceed the production target of at least 1.5 times the saleable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We continue to see strong performance across the balance of our portfolio in oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Excluding revenue from the olanzapine portfolio, the non-incretin growth of the company was 17% in Q3. We achieved several key pipeline milestones this quarter, including the approval of Ebglyss in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The approval of Kisunla in Japan and Great Britain for the treatment of early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. Disclosure of positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight. And the recent presentation of positive data from the Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 study, evaluating different dosing regimens for donanemab. Our manufacturing expansion agenda remains a top priority. In September, we invested nearly $2 billion to increase our manufacturing footprint in Ireland. This brings the total commitments to build, upgrade and acquire manufacturing facilities announced since 2020 to more than $20 billion. And beyond this $20 billion commitment, we also announced a separate $4.5 billion investment to develop the Lilly Medicine Foundry. This first-of-its-kind facility will be dedicated to research and development for manufacturing process design and to develop high-quality investigational medicines for our clinical trials. It will be located in Lebanon, Indiana, a short drive from the corporate headquarters. This investment underscores our confidence in our pipeline and the urgency we bring to bring our innovative medicines to patients around the world. In August, we closed the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics, adding oral integrin assets to our early phase immunology portfolio. And lastly, we returned over $1.6 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. On Slide 6, you'll see key events since our Q2 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other key updates. Last month, we appointed Lucas Montarce as Lilly's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lucas has 23 years of experience at Lilly and has worked with the executive team and the Board for a long time. So congratulations, Lucas. Now, let me turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q3 financial results and provide an update on our 2024 financial guidance. Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before taking questions, let me briefly summarize our progress in the quarter. We had strong revenue growth across both Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as our oncology, immunology and neurosciences medicines. Significant advancements in our pipeline included approval of Ebglyss for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in the U.S., Kisunla for early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease in Japan and Great Britain, and positive data disclosures for Phase 3 studies of tirzepatide and donanemab. We are confident in Lilly's bright future. We have now launched in major geographies the cohort of medicines that we expect will serve as the driver of our growth through the balance of this decade. That is Mounjaro, Jaypirca, Omvoh, Zepbound, Kisunla and Ebglyss. We expect these products, together with our already launched products will contribute to strong growth of the company in 2025. In addition, we plan to continue to scale R&D and step-up our investment across manufacturing and commercial to support the successful launches of these medicines to help even more patients next year. So now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate a Q&A session. Yes, maybe because it's kind of a macro thing you're asking there. But I think first of all, there is a lot of lumpiness in channel stocking. I think all the sell-side analysts on this call have probably struggled with that as we have, exiting Q1, we can recall that we had a number of our dosage forms on back-order, and we pretty much reached a NATR of supply in the wholesalers. That was kind of restocked in Q2 and then we saw a drawdown in Q3. I think what we really don't control and don't attempt to, but as a reality is that downstream customers from Lilly, wholesalers and retailers, are making their own decisions about which of the 12 different dosage forms they want to stock and at what level. There are some physical constraints to that, cold-chain, capacity is constrained and their financial constraints, working capital that they're managing to. Those are their decisions to maintain their customer service levels. I think what we've done is sort of move our set point of how much stock we want to have on hand before we go initiate demand-stimulating activities, which we had more or less paused for Mounjaro in the first half and never started for Zepbound remembering we launched in December of last year. So I think the in-market data, you guys can all read, and you see Geoff yourself, and we do see acceleration of both brands in Q3 over Q2 in actual consumption. And our estimate is that will continue or accelerate as we add U.S. stimulation to that demand, which, as Patrik said, we're going to begin doing here really mid-November in earnest. And ex-U.S. demand is another factor that affects sales and that too we moved out launches by about a quarter just to make sure we had enough buffer. So when customers want a prescription, they could get it filled reliably. And I think that's an important thing for us to keep that trust going forward. So at a macro-level, is there a demand problem here? No, actually. Is there a supply problem? No, although if we had unlimited demand, there would be. So we're carefully gating those two things together. As we escalate supply in Q4, which, as I mentioned, we're going to beat the 50% growth number, you'll see us grow our demand stimulation as well. And I think that's really about Q4, but even more about Q1 of 2025 and continuing acceleration there. So business is super-healthy. We feel good about where we are. Obviously, there was some choppiness this quarter, but I think underlying growth here is as strong as we would have hoped. Yes, I mean, I can't really speculate too much what's going through the FDA's mind, but I think other commentators have mentioned that the longer this goes on, the more risk they have to their own regulatory framework. And so, my guess is the FDA is concerned about that and they want to win this case and they're putting their ducks in a row to do so. There is an alternate, I guess, perspective that they don't care, but I think they do care. The other thing I'll say is we work closely with the FDA to approve new capacities. And it's important to note here we could do more with them, and we communicate this to them directly. They're not hearing anything here. They haven't heard from you already, but we have invested massively in parenteral filling capacity and API capacity. And a big part of the delivery schedule for that, which can take 2.5 years to 4 years is actually the regulatory process itself. So it's difficult to think about a world where the workaround to that is to unleash unregulated product. The workaround should be to collaborate with the companies to speed up legitimate product delivery and we would embrace that discussion fully. We have a lot of things in queue now with the FDA or about to be that could speed up what already is an impressive production ramp, we would welcome that opportunity. Yes. Well, I mean in the long run, of course, there's a potential 1 billion customers on the planet. And I think we've said, I've said that probably the only way that a big chunk of those are served well is with oral products because of the production system efficiencies there versus parenteral filling of proteins. So it's important. Of course, we're in the lead there and we want to see our orforglipron be successful, but we need the data and then submission and launch would put that sometime something like less than 2 years from now. But I wouldn't characterize compounding as a crisis. It certainly isn't one for us. I think the problem is people are being harmed and duped, right? And so that's kind of what we'd like to see stop. But as Patrik said, we don't really see a financial impact on Lilly of compounding. I think that as an industry, we should probably be worried that if this grows and is allowed to continue, then it sort of creates this back to our generic world. But as I said, I think the FDA wants to stop that for good reasons, for public safety reasons and they'll do that. At the end of the day, FDAs use this as a product-by-product analysis. And right now, tirzepatide is not in shortage and therefore for mass compounding should not be permitted. There's a stay, etc. in the court, but we think that should be the state there. As it relates to semaglutide, you'll have to ask Novo that, although we're working hard to help Novo with their supply problem by reducing demand for semaglutide and increasing it for tirzepatide. So maybe it will resolve that way. I can start, let me just jump in. I mean, we will have a chance to lay out that as we did this year in our guidance call in early February. But qualitatively, you can see the flow of our investment and CapEx into this space and you could kind of go backwards three years or so and expect the capacities we announced then to be coming on full line in that timeframe and then rolling that forward. So of course, we made an announcement this year and those are a couple of years away from having full impact. But if you go back to '21, '22, '23, we are working hard to bring those online and expect good growth next year. So I think Lucas mentioned, we're seeing acceleration in demand, but that means acceleration in supply during this year and we expect strong growth on the total for next year and we'll lay out the details if we get into the guide call. If you have anything else to add to that, Lucas? I think the short answer to both the question is no and no. We didn't change our terms, and I don't think we've seen any change in retail stocking of the auto-injector because the vials are filled. I would just add that actually unaided awareness for Zepbound, although we're -- everyone on this call is highly aware of the brand-name is actually not very hot, and then we launched this drug almost a year ago and have done no advertising. So I think it is time to introduce the brand and so people are aware of that when they speak to their doctor."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. The Slide 7 summarizes our financial performance in the third quarter, which is highlighted by strong revenue growth across our new products as well as our non-incretin medicines. As Dave mentioned, revenue grew 42% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio and was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound. Revenue from our non-incretin portfolio grew 17% after excluding the impact of revenue from the olanzapine portfolio. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to 82.2%. Gross margin primarily benefited from favorable product mix and higher realized prices, partially offset by the sale of rights for the olanzapine portfolio in Q3 2023 and higher manufacturing costs. R&D expenses increased 13%, driven by continued investment in both our early and late-stage portfolio. We recognized $2.8 billion of acquired IPR&D charges, primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Therapeutics. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 16%, primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting ongoing and future launches. Operating income increased to nearly $1.8 billion driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expenses growth. The effective tax rate was 37.6%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of non-deductible acquired IPR&D charges. Other than the impact of acquired IPR&D, the underlying tax rate was consistent with previously provided guidance. We delivered earnings per share of $1.18, up from $0.10 in Q3 2023. And this includes a negative impact of $3.08 from acquired IPR&D charges. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 46% with volume growing 35% driven by Zepbound Mounjaro and partially offset by declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 11% in the U.S., primarily driven by Trulicity, Humalog and Verzenio. While Mounjaro and Zepbound demand remains strong and growing, quarter-by-quarter revenue growth in 2024 has been impacted by supply and channel dynamics. As we highlighted in Q2, increase in supply led to higher shipments that allow us to fulfill the majority of wholesalers back orders, serving as a tailwind to sales. In Q3, we saw channel inventory decreased as wholesalers continued to navigate the complexities of high-volume cold-chain products across a dozen different dose and brand combinations. We estimate this inventory decrease impacted Q3 sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound by mid-single digits as a percentage of aggregate used sales of these products. Europe revenue grew 39% in constant currency when excluding the impact of the divestiture of the olanzapine portfolio. This growth was primarily driven by Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. We continue to be pleased with the Mounjaro equipment launches in Europe and are now launched in the U.K., Germany, Spain, and most recently Italy. Revenue in the rest of the world grew 45% in constant currency, driven by volume growth of Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, strong performance of Verzenio and Jardiance. Moving to China, revenue increased 17% in constant currency. This increase was driven by volume growth of Tyvyt and favorable pricing impacts for Humalog. Finally, Japan grew 17% in revenue in constant currency. Volume growth of 20% was driven by uptick of Mounjaro, Verzenio and Jardiance. The Slide 10 provides additional perspective of performance across our product categories. Mounjaro sales were $3.1 billion globally, with almost $2.4 billion of net sales in the U.S. We continue to see solid uptake of Mounjaro outside the U.S. with sales in Q3 totaling $728 million. Verzenio continued its growth trajectory with worldwide sales increasing 32%, driven by strong execution in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca worldwide revenue was $81 million. When excluding the impact of Japan collaboration milestones recognized in Q2, Jaypirca continued its sequential quarter-over-quarter growth trend, demonstrating sustained uptake in both the MCL and CLL patient population. Worldwide Omvoh revenue increased to $41 million. We are pleased with our progress gaining commercial access for Omvoh in the U.S. As of January 2025, we will have first-line access at two out-of-the three major PBMs. We were also excited to receive U.S. approval for Kisunla and Ebglyss in Q3. The Kisunla launch is underway and progressing, and the Ebglyss launch began early this month. We are pleased to have already secured formulary access for Ebglyss with one of the major PBMs. Worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 22%, driven by lower volume, partially offset by higher realized prices. The Slide 11 provides an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We continue to see strong growth trends leading to sales of over $1.2 billion. We have broad formulary coverage for Zepbound. As of October 1, Zepbound has approximately 87% access in the commercial segment, and we are making ongoing progress expanding our employer opt-ins. We are in the early days of launching single-dose Zepbound vials in the U.S. exclusively through LillyDirect. 2.5 milligram and 5-milligram single-dose vials are currently available to self-pay patient at a 50% or greater discount compared to the list price of other incretin medicines for obesity. This offering helps even more adults living with obesity access Zepbound including Medicare beneficiaries and those without them. Slide 12, we provide an update on capital allocation. On Slide 13, you can see our updated guidance for the full year. We are updating our revenue guidance range to $45.4 billion to $46 billion. The new midpoint range represents approximately 50% growth in Q4 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, demonstrating a continuation of revenue growth acceleration. We are investing heavily in increasing supply of tirzepatide and have been carefully balancing our demand creation activities and launches into new markets with our production to support continuity of care for patients. In Q3, we continued to be prudent scaling up and demand-generation activities. This is the driver for lowering the top end of the range. We continue to expect that we will exceed our goals to increase production of incretin saleable doses by at least 50% in the second half of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023. Now with all the doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound available, we will accelerate demand activities and while there is a lag to flow-through revenue, we expect to see the impact of these efforts in Q2 and into 2025. Lastly, we also expect new Mounjaro launches internationally to contribute to growing in Q4. Our expected ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue remains unchanged on both a reported and a non-GAAP basis. Other income and expense is now expected to be in the range of $425 million to $325 million of expense on a reported basis and is unchanged on a non-GAAP basis. We have updated our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 17%, driven by the impact of non-deductible IPR&D in Q3. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $12.05 to $12.55 on a reported basis and $13.02 to $13.52 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect the updated mentioned earlier, as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q3 of approximately $3.1 billion. Now, I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Maybe just to add to that, thank you, Chris, for the question. When you look at the midpoint that I mentioned, 50% growth that we expect for the fourth quarter compared with the 42% is a step-up of 8%. When you remove the channel dynamics that we alluded in Q2, the step-up of growth is very consistent throughout the quarters. So the acceleration and the drivers are the ones that Patrik mentioned. Maybe just to add to that, OUS as well, we continue to advance or engage new countries that we are going to be launching Mounjaro as well that will drive that part of that growth acceleration in the fourth quarter. Maybe just say one comment from my side. When we talk about more so from the demand perspective, I think in the U.S. in particular, the proxy that we alluded to on the growth that we see across both and Mounjaro and Zepbound in TRx of that 25% sequential quarter-on-quarter is a good proxy to start basically trending out into next year, more so to provide more perspective from the market side and the demand side than the manufacturer. Yes. Sorry. Thank you, Chris, for your question and thank you for quoting me about this new ratio, the gross margin minus OpEx divided by revenue is quite a lengthy ratio. But just going to your question in the short run you see that we have grown our ratio in the last few quarters as we have been having this cycle of significant growth trajectory and we are starting to ramp up our investment both in SG&A and R&D. That effect will continue for sure for getting into the fourth quarter of the year that is including as part of our guidance. And what we expect to see moving into 2025, going into your question is we do expect to ramp up our demand generation activities in SG&A that will pay down into 2025, as well as we will scale our R&D. We talk about some of the assets on our portfolio that moves into Phase 2 and Phase 3 that will continue to play-out as we ramp-up those investments to drive long-term sustainable growth. So, I would expect that in the short term, we continue to see some operating margin expansion on this ratio. In long term, again, we will continue to expand and drive sustainable growth that will basically justify the investments that we do in SG&A and R&D. Yes, sure. And thank you for the questions. Going back to the Mounjaro so far in the year, we kind of signaled throughout the year that once we were sunsetting last year, the co-pay program that we had that we will see that basically tailwind on the price year-on-year comparison that played out as what we expected. And the sunset, of course, takes again a little bit of time to see that playing out. So you see a little bit of that spillover effect getting into Q3. Getting into Q4, we don't expect to see major dynamics on that. And what you're starting to see basically in Q3 is what we project into the fourth quarter of the year. Maybe getting into the obstructive sleep apnea indication, any comments that you would like to add, Patrik, on that front?"

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Chris. I think it's first important to emphasize that the overall performance and health of both Mounjaro and Zepbound are very strong. And then we saw a slightly accelerated growth in Q3 of more than 25% and also the market, the underlying market for both Type-2 and obesity continues to grow. And we took a more prudent approach than we anticipated in Q3, pretty much driven by the need to deliver a good consumer experience. That has been one of our triggers for any investments based upon the experience we faced in the first half of the year when a lot of the calls of our customer service center was about supply, actually more than 20%. We are now down to less than 1% of those being supply-related. So what we are doing right now is that we are investing heavily in our DTC effort, which we haven't done in the past, whilst supply allows us to invest strongly there, but it's not a demand issue. And similarly, we are fully leaning in on all the HCP promotional efforts, also providing samples in the marketplace to providers. So we remain very confident based upon the underlying trend in the marketplace today and also the growth of both Zepbound and Mounjaro in terms of TRx, NBRx, and TRx that we are after a good Q4. Well, thank you very much, Evan. I think as we all know, that is not one reliable source when it comes to quantifying the compounding market. We also know that it's opaque and mainly cash and there are probably reasons to believe that some of those patients are off label. So from our perspective, we actually don't estimate there to be a huge financial impact of compounding on our business. But our major concern here has been driven by safety, but thousands of people in the U.S. are getting medicine that is not approved by the FDA for quality, safety or efficacy purposes. So that has been our concern, and we are mainly leaning in now, as we said earlier, to drive demand in the U.S. marketplace for patients with obesity and Type-2 diabetes. Yes. Maybe just a few comments on Mounjaro. Prior to moving into Zepbound, I think with Mounjaro, we have really good access and it's 93% and I think pretty much where we need to be across commercial and Medicare. In terms of Zepbound, I think we've made progress in record time here, close to 90% commercial access and we continue to see improvement in terms of employers opting. You're correct, we heard stories about some employers opting out, but the major trend is actually in favor of opting-in to the anti-obesity medications. So we are definitely north of the 50% and I think we will have some new data in the first part of 2026 since both the employers are making those decisions effective one-one in the new year to come. So I think we are very, very optimistic in that part of our business, but we're also continuing to make progress in terms of access for Medicaid. And just since we connected last time, we have gained six incremental states for Medicaid and most recently effective 10-1, we have California and Massachusetts. So big states are now covering more than 30 million lives, and we expect to continue to make progress in that space. And lastly, I would just emphasize the potential approval here of obstructive sleep apnea. The approval of obstructive sleep apnea will help us with employer opt-in because we know that outcome studies are critical to convince employers. But on top of that, it also opens up the door for access in Medicare, and with the decision that CMS announced back in April this year, we are confident that we will gain access also for OSA in Medicare. So I think we have many reasons to be excited about the outlook for 2025, driven by improved access across the commercial America space as well as the investments we have done, we believe to be direct. Well, overall, we launched LillyDirect self-pay by just a month ago. Not we are pleased with the uptake, but we also realized that it takes some time for healthcare system to adopt the self-pay in their EMR systems. But so far, I would say that the impact of TRx has been quite limited and would be defined as being at the low-single to single-digit level. We expect Lilly Direct self-pay though to be a very important channel to grow new therapy starts moving forward, but not significant in Q3. Yes, you know, I think we are comparing a very different market, the first half of '25 versus the second half of 2025. We faced some significant supply constraints, and it wouldn't be responsible for us at that point in time to drive any major DTC investments and just provide consumers with a bad experience at the pharmacy level. We have much more confidence now in terms of the supply moving forward. And this is not a demand issue problem. It's actually just a supply opportunity and we want to drive up that consumer awareness. So while we're doing extremely well, we just need to have in mind that the penetration in terms of obesity is just at the low single-digit level, 4% to 5% and there is still a huge stigma. So what we can do here to drive patient activation is going to serve us very well moving forward. I would just say in terms of Zepbound, we are still very early on in launch. And I think you clarified the stability in pricing Q3 over Q2, look out. And what we need to have in mind is that we will continue to increase access. We will see launches outside of U.S. as well now with Zepbound being approved and also can impact the global net pricing dynamics moving forward. Thank you very much, Courtney. But we are looking forward to the readouts of the orfo Phase 3 trials next year 2025. But I think overall, we see a significant opportunity here. It's going to be the first oral if we deliver along the lines as we saw in Phase 2 with an efficacy along the lines of an injectable along the lines of semaglutide. So I think that will really position us to scale globally. We are avoiding the cold-chain requirements, etc. But also in the U.S., we see an opportunity to further penetrate because we know that even if the experience with the auto-injector, once you have tried it is really good. We know that there is a need there in the marketplace that probably impacts 20% to 25% of the population. So I think there is a huge opportunity to expand. And when you refer particularly to be ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, I think there is an obligation on our side to really better understand how can you best keep patients on treatment for a longer period of time knowing that obesity is a chronic disease. That's why we're leaning in on some of MAINTAIN to see what is the lowest efficacious dose that you can keep patients on during a longer time. And similarly, with ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, we don't expect a major shift led by clinicians from injectables to orals. But I think this is one alternative to continue to treat patients for the periods they need to be on medication, which is a chronic disease, and we are doing whatever we can to improve adherence and improve patients outcomes."

            "name": "Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Lucas. Lilly R&D had another productive quarter. So let me begin by sharing some late-phase updates, including some exciting Phase 3 data that we shared at recent medical congresses. Starting with neuroscience. Yesterday, at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's Disease Conference, we are pleased to share positive results from our Phase 3 TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 trial, which evaluated different dosing regimens for initiation of donanemab treatments to understand their effect on ARIA-E. In this trial, we tested a modified titration, which shifted one vial of donanemab from the first infusion to the third, as shown on Slide 14. We designed this modified titration to achieve identical total dose of donanemab administered in the first three months as does our standard dosing regimen, but we hypothesized that the smoother increase in dose could result in less ARIA. We are pleased to see in this trial that indeed by pharmacokinetic analysis, we achieved equivalent cumulative exposure between the modified titration and the standard dosing regimen. And as a result, we achieved similar levels of amyloid plaque removal and phospho-tau217 reduction. Importantly, we also confirmed our hypothesis on ARIA and showed that the modified titration reduced the incidence of ARIA-E to 14% compared with 24% for those receiving the standard dosing regimen. As well, lower frequency of symptomatic ARIA-E, lower radiographic severity of all categories of ARIA-E, and lower ARIA-E and ApoE 4 genotype carriers was observed using the modified titration as compared to the standard dosing regimen. We plan to submit a supplemental DLA to the FDA in the coming weeks for this modified titration. Our efforts on Remternetug continue to progress and we are starting a Phase 3 efficacy study of Remternetug focused on preclinical phase of the disease. Similar to our ongoing TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 3 trial for donanemab where we are trying to reduce the risk of progressions symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. In this upcoming Phase 3 registrational trial called TRAILRUNNER 3, we are evaluating a fixed duration of monthly subcutaneous administration of Remternetug, offering what we see as a potentially convenient option for this earlier patient population. We'll share more details about the study design of TRAILRUNNER 3 tomorrow at CTAD. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. Last month we shared data from our remaining Phase 3 studies for our weekly basal insulin called Insulin efsitora alfa. As a reminder, the efsitora Phase 3 consists of five global registration studies, four of which are in adults with Type-2 diabetes, and one is in adults with Type-1 diabetes. We are pleased that each study met its primary endpoint of non-inferior A1c reduction versus insulin glargine or insulin degludec, which are the most frequently used daily basal insulins. In the studies evaluating efsitora in people with Type-2 diabetes, the results demonstrated that efsitora achieved meaningful A1c reduction with relatively low hypoglycemia rates. We were particularly excited with the results for QWINT-1 in which efsitora was administered via six doses using a single-use autoinjector. In this 52-week study in people with Type-2 diabetes, efsitora lowered participants A1c by 1.31% compared to 1.27% for insulin glargine. This impressive A1c reduction was achieved in low hypoglycemia rates. Actually, efsitora had approximately 40% lower rates of severe or clinically significant hypoglycemia than the daily insulin glargine. These data highlight the power of an easier-to-use dose form of a weekly insulin for people who are just initiating basal insulin therapy for the first time. We look forward to discussing the results from the QWINT Phase 3 program with global regulatory agencies. It has also been a productive quarter for our late-phase incretin programs. First, as shown on Slide 15, we shared positive 176-week data from the SURMOUNT-1 Phase 3 study of tirzepatide in adults with pre-diabetes and obesity or overweight, which demonstrated a remarkable 94% reduction in the risk of developing Type-2 diabetes. This is the longest duration tirzepatide data to-date, and we are highly encouraged to see that patients on the 15-milligram dose achieved sustained weight loss of nearly 23% during the more than three-year treatment period and that this weight loss was accompanied by a significant reduction in risk of developing diabetes. We look forward to sharing the detailed results next week at ObesityWeek. These results add to compelling data showing the benefit of the combined pharmacology of dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonism in several obesity-related complications, including Type-2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis or MASH, moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and heart failure. We are working quickly to bring tirzepatide to more adults living with obesity and its complications, and we are pleased to share that we expect U.S. regulatory action for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and obstructive sleep apnea yet this year. And that we will submit for U.S. approval for tirzepatide in adults with obesity and heart failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction before the end of this year. Another avenue to advance patient care is the maintenance of body weight reductions. We are conducting two Phase 3b weight loss maintenance trials. The first is SURMOUNT-MAINTAIN, which compares either tirzepatide 5 milligrams or tirzepatide maximum tolerated dose to placebo. The second is ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, which evaluates our oral GLP-1 orforglipron versus placebo after tirzepatide or semaglutide in participants who completed SURMOUNT-5, the 3b head-to-head study of tirzepatide versus semaglutide. We look forward to sharing the topline data readout for SURMOUNT-5 later this year. Next, in oncology. The Phase 3 EMBER-3 study evaluating our oral SERD, imlunestrant, in patients with second-line ER positive HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer was positive. The study evaluated three-arms, imlunestrant as a monotherapy, investigator's choice of endocrine therapy monotherapy, and imlunestrant in combination with abemaciclib. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit an NDA to the FDA by year-end, and we look forward to sharing detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. The Phase 3 portion of the olomorasib first-line KRAS G12C lung cancer study is now underway. The first Phase 3 trial for this class of medicines in newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression. This comes after recently defining the dose of the medicine in combination with standard-of-care regimens in consultation with the FDA under Project Optimus. We continue to believe we could have a leading agent in this class and look forward to execution of the late-stage program. Finally, in immunology, we're excited by the recent U.S. FDA approval of lebrikizumab as Ebglyss for adults and children 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Ebglyss provides a new first-line biologic treatment that targets a main cause of eczema inflammation that offers significant early skin clearance and itch relief with convenient once-monthly maintenance dosing following the initial phase of treatment. We recently shared compelling long-term data showing that lebrikizumab provides sustained disease control for up to three years in more than 80% of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who responded to Ebglyss treatment at 15 weeks. We have also initiated two Phase 3 studies of lebrikizumab in adults with perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. As we continue to expand our immunology portfolio to help more patients, we're conducting two Phase 3 studies evaluating Ixekizumab and tirzepatide together in patients with obesity or overweight in either psoriatic arthritis or moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases and can negatively impact disease outcomes. Taltz has already demonstrated strong efficacy in treating psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis and we are excited to see the potential for additional benefits for patients when combined with the significant and sustained weight loss offered by Zepbound. Slide 16 shows select pipeline opportunities as of October 28 and Slide 17 shows potential key events for the year. I've already covered our late-phase progress, so now I'll quickly cover updates for the early-phase pipeline. Starting again with neuroscience. We recently initiated a Phase 2 study of an epiregulin antibody in chronic neuropathic pain associated with distal sensory polyneuropathy. We had previously shown this molecule in Phase 1 of the pipeline as an undisclosed mechanism in pain. We also have begun Phase 1 studies on two new neurodegeneration assets, an alpha-synuclein directed siRNA and a tau-directed siRNA. Earlier this morning at CTAD, we disclosed detailed results from our Phase 2 study of Ceperognastat, our oral GlcNAcase anti-tau agent. While neither dose slowed clinical decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease, biomarker data suggests potential impacts on tau pathology, brain volume and neuroinflammation. Safety follow-ups for the study are ongoing. Turning to Cardiometabolic Health. In the coming days, we will initiate a Phase 2 study of Eloralintide, our long-acting amylin receptor agonist for chronic weight management in combination with tirzepatide in patients with Type-2 diabetes. And a Phase 2 study of Bimagrumab, alone or in combination with tirzepatide for chronic weight management in participants without Type-2 diabetes. We will also be advancing Volenrelaxin, our long-acting relaxin molecule into Phase 2 in adults with chronic kidney disease. We removed the Phase 1 APOC3 siRNA asset in cardiovascular disease as it did not meet our bar for continuing clinical development. In oncology, 2024 continues to be a very productive year for new clinical starts. Since the last call, we advanced three new molecules into Phase 1 studies. Our oral SMARCA2 or BRM inhibitor, our KRAS G12D inhibitor, and our Pan KRAS inhibitor. These three initiations bring the total new clinical starts in oncology in 2024 to seven, exceeding the goal we shared earlier this year to put at least five new potential medicines in the clinic. And we've done that across three different modalities, emblematic of our strategy to utilize therapeutic modality diversification to combat treatment resistance and improve patient outcomes. We expect this new slate of clinical programs will set us up for an exciting 2025 as we look to see which programs deliver differentiated and important early clinical datasets for patients. Finally, in early-stage immunology, we're also excited to initiate several new Phase 2 studies. First, we moved DC-853, an oral IL-17 inhibitor from the DICE Therapeutics acquisition into Phase 2 in adults with moderate-to-severe black psoriasis. And we removed DC-806 from the pipeline in favor of 853, which is a more potent molecule. Second, we are initiating a Phase 2 study combining Eltrekibart and Mirikizumab in adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In addition, we are terminating the Phase 2b study of Peresolimab in rheumatoid arthritis due to the overall benefit-risk profile of the molecule in this study. Finally, after welcoming our Morphic colleagues to Lilly in August, our pipeline now reflects the oral alpha 4-beta 7 integrin inhibitor MORF-057 in Phase 2 for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis and moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. Q3 was an exceptionally productive quarter for Lilly R&D, and we're pleased with our important progress we're making for patients across all of our therapeutic areas. Now I'll turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Good. Thanks for your concern, Joe. Thanks for your good question, Dave. Yes, I mean peresolimab is a really interesting mechanism for us and we were excited when we saw the Phase 2a data. It was a small number of patients, but had a relatively profound effect on RA symptoms, particularly in patients who had failed the previous biologics. So we sought out to replicate that in a larger Phase 2b study. Unfortunately, when we came to the end of that study, the benefit-risk that we've seen in the Phase 2a study was not fully borne out in Phase 2b. So just based on the overall profile, which includes both the efficacy and the safety of the drug, we decided not to pursue that. As to your question on a follow-on PD-1 agonist, we don't have one that we're pursuing right now. So that's I'll say about that. And I think, of course, we'll look forward to presenting the full data package at a future meeting. Thanks Joe."

            "name": "Jacob Van Naarden",
            "content": "Yes, happy to take it. Thanks for the question. Our position and expectation here around market share with respect to the adjuvant setting for Verzenio versus Kisqali hasn't really changed sort of pre-approval versus now. I think we have a very robust clinical data package with a lot of follow-up on our dataset, which is critically important for prescribers and a 2-year regimen where patients can finish their adjuvant therapy and move on with their life, hopefully remaining recurrence-free. That's a pretty compelling proposition. It has been, and I think is recognized as such in a variety of treatment guidelines that for the high-risk population, the monarchE patient population prefer Verzenio over Kisqali as standard-of-care. Those expert guidelines have weighed in over the past couple of months. I don't expect that to change materially. Of course, with a new market entrant, the percentage of patients in the setting who get any CDK4/6 inhibitor as adjuvant therapy could go up and that would benefit us and I expect that there will be some patients for whom Kisqali is a more appropriate choice, but I don't expect it to be a significant shift in our overall market dynamics. And of course, the node-negative population is not where we're indicated and not where we're used and that's a story for them to tell. On the second part of your question around Part D reform, it will have an impact. Of course, there's a push and pull here on the amount we have to contribute for catastrophic coverage being a downside, and of course, the co-pay cap, out-of-pocket cap on patients, and particularly in Medicare where that could be a tailwind on the brand. I think it's hard to know exactly where that will net out. It probably nets out sort of in the neutral range. I don't think it will end up being a headwind or a tailwind sort of in totality, but we have to see how that shakes out. On the last part of your question around negotiation list, I don't want to speculate on that. I don't think we have enough information yet given the evolving nature of all of the different medicines that could be up for negotiation to actually say one way or another, which ones will be there just yet."

Of course, we need to continue to develop access in other markets. And then on the chronically management side, we feel good about the prospects of adding countries to drive access. At the same time, there's also developed self-pay markets like the U.K., UAE and Saudi, where we're already seeing significant progression of our share and penetration where we actually have leading share of market in TRx in these markets. And we continue to focus on both developing the self-pay, but also increasing access for both Type-2 diabetes and chronic weight management over time. And that will be gradual as we enter new markets."

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q2 2024 earnings call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chairman and CEO; and Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Gordon Brooks, Interim Financial -- Chief Financial Officer; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Lilly Oncology; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health and Lilly USA. And we're also joined by Makela Irons, Mike Springate, Lauren Zurke of the IR team. During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 4. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note that our commentary will focus on non-GAAP financial measures. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave.\nDave Ricks : Thanks, Joe. It's an exciting time here at Lilly as our growth trajectory accelerated in the second quarter. Our investments in advancing innovative medicine are focused on manufacturing expansion are bringing Lilly medicines to more people around the world. On Slide 5, you can see details of the financial performance in the second quarter and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 36% in Q2 with our new products growing nearly $3.5 billion compared to the same period last year. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is strong and growing as access and supply continue to expand. While weekly prescription volume was volatile in the first half of the year due to challenges fulfilling high demand, our progress on supply gives us confidence in our outlook. Q2 saw impressive performance across other areas of the business as well. Excluding the sale of the rights to Baqsimi last year, non-incretin growth was 17% worldwide with growth spread across geographies, including 25% growth in the United States. And our $3 billion increase in revenue guidance reflects our expectation that momentum will accelerate through the balance of the year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the approval of Kisunla, the brand name for donanemab in the U.S. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the approval of Jaypirca in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors, the submission of tirzepatide in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and the positive top line results from the SUMMIT Phase 3 trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. Lilly now has a significant opportunity to create new medicines through a broad internal portfolio and active business development to support our long-term growth. In obesity, our strategy is to comprehensively address this global public health crisis, pursuing opportunities against every rational mechanism, indication and dosage form. We are investing broadly in this disease and now have 11 new molecules currently in the clinic across multiple indications. We're also investing in a wide range of late-stage Phase 3 programs. We recently shared the positive data of tirzepatide in OSA and -- Orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 small molecule, has a comprehensive Phase 3 program underway in diabetes and obesity with nine trials currently running and readout starting next year. With tirzepatide, our GIP/GLP-1 glucan try agonist. We have initiated a broad Phase 3 development program studying the molecule in obesity, OSA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular and renal outcomes as well as type 2 diabetes. These readouts start in 2026. Our top priority remains executing on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. In May, we announced plans to invest an additional $5.3 billion in our Lebanon, Indiana manufacturing sites, bringing our total investment there to $9 billion. We believe this is the largest single investment in synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing in the history of the United States. Importantly, this expansion will enhance capacity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Zepbound and Mounjaro. Since 2020, we have committed more than $18 billion to build, upgrade or acquire facilities in the U.S. and Europe, and we began to see the benefit of these investments. We are making near-term progress to ramp production, including at new sites like Research Trial Park, existing Lilly sites and contract manufacturing organizations. Our Concur North Carolina site is progressing well. We're in the process of running validation and expect this facility will initiate production by the end of 2024 with product available to ship in 2025. We also continue to make progress on different presentations for tirzepatide. We have now launched our multidose quick pen in multiple markets outside the U.S. with positive early indicators of patient adoption. And in Gordon's remarks, he will preview our plans to launch vials here in the U.S. Lastly, in terms of external innovation. In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Morphic, a biopharma company developing oral -- therapies for treatment of serious chronic diseases, including a Phase 2 asset being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease. On Slide 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. As we announced in June, Anat Ashkenazi resigned as Lilly's Chief Financial Officer to become the CFO of Alphabet. We wish Anat well in her new role and thank her for your partnership and leadership of our financial organization in the last 3 years. We have named Gordon Brooks Interim CFO as an internal and external search for Anat successor is currently underway. Gordon has been with the company for 29 years and also serves as our controller and the leader of the corporate strategy group for the company. In other leadership news, Alonzo Weems, our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Risk Management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will retire at the end of the year after 27 years of service. And Melissa Seymour has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Global Quality and a member of the company's executive committee following John Norton's recent retirement. I want to thank Alonzo for his many years of service and welcome Melissa to the Lilly team. Now let me turn the call over to Gordon to review our Q2 financial results.\nGordon Brooks: Thanks, Dave. So, I'm on Slide 7, which summarizes the financial performance in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter revenue growth of 36% was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Verzenio. When excluding revenue from the sale of rights to Baqsimi in Q2 of last year, revenue grew 46%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 79.8% in Q2 of '23 to 82% in Q2 of '24. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable product -- and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher production costs. R&D expenses increased 15% driven by continued investment in our portfolio and in our people. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by promotional efforts associated ongoing and future launches as well as investments in our people. Operating income increased 90% in Q2, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.5% in Q2 of '24 compared with 16.1% in Q2 of '23. The Q2 '24 tax rate reflects a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, while the Q2 '23 rate reflected the impact of earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.92 in Q2, an 86% increase compared to the prior year. Q2 '24 results include a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.09 in the prior quarter, Q2 of '23. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 42% in Q2. Volume growth of 27% was driven by Zepbound, Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by sale of rights for Baqsimi in Q2 of '23 and declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 15%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. As noted in our Q4 -- Q1 2024 earnings call, unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler back orders at the end of Q1. In Q2, we fulfilled the majority of these back orders, improving wholesaler stocking levels. We estimate that U.S. Mounjaro and Zepbound aggregate sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by channel stocking that we estimate totaled high teens to mid-20s as a percent of U.S. sales as we rebuilt inventory from extremely low levels in the spring and to account for the growth of these brands. We are pleased that the group's supply situation is reflected on the FDA shortage website, which currently shows all doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound, listed as available and the two lower doses of Trulicity as available. While wholesaler back orders in the U.S. have been reduced substantially, it's important to note that the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, more so for medicines that require refrigeration and offer at several different doses. These factors may continue to result in variability in the patient experience at the pharmacy counter. While supply and demand has come into better balance, we expect increase in demand may result in periodic supply tightness for certain presentations and dose levels. We have a continued broad agenda to further increase supply, and we'll continue to look at all options. Today, we are excited to announce plans to further expand access to Zepbound with the launch of the 2.5-milligram and 5-milligram single-dose files in the coming weeks with more details to come at that time. In Europe, revenue grew 20% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro launch uptake in the U.K. and Germany. We also had strong volume growth from Verzenio, Jardiance, which was partially offset by decreased volume from Trulicity. Japan performance was strong in the second quarter with 15% revenue growth in constant currency. Volume growth of 21% was driven by uptake of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Moving to China. Q2 revenue increased 1% in constant currency. Growth was driven by -- Olumiant and Taltz, partially offset by Trulicity and Cialis. Mounjaro was recently approved in China for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. We have not yet announced expected launch timing in this market. Revenue in Rest of World increased 61% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro volume growth from demand and channel dynamics. Slide 10 provides additional perspective on performance across our product categories. Verzenio solid growth in the second quarter across major geographies with worldwide sales increasing 44%, driven by the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $92 million worldwide, which included a $19 million partner milestone payment related to Japan. Jaypirca continued impressive quarter-over-quarter growth, building on the brand's uptake from both the MCL and CLL patient populations. OMVOH is launched in the U.S. and 14 international markets with sales of $26 million in Q2. These launches continue to progress well with increasing patient starts. And in the U.S., we expect sales to accelerate as the product-specific code went live on July 1. Mounjaro sales in Q2 were $3.1 billion globally with $2.4 billion in the U.S. Revenue growth in the U.S. reflected continued strong demand as well as the improved channel dynamics discussed earlier. We're seeing solid uptake in Mounjaro outside the U.S., with sales in Q2 totaling $677 million. In the first half of the year, we launched the quick pen presentation in the U.K., Germany and the UAE. So far in Q3, we've also launched Mounjaro Quick Pen in Spain and plan to launch an additional market throughout 2024. In Q2, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 31%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 36% driven by lower volume, primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints, partially offset by improved wholesaler stocking levels on services. Turning to Slide 11. We have an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We've seen exceptional growth trends for Zepbound that have accelerated as production has ramped leading to sales of over $1.2 billion in Q2. We are rapidly building our formulary coverage for Zepbound in the U.S. and as of July 1 had approximately 86% access in the commercial segment. We estimate over 50% of employers have opted into anti-obesity medicine coverage and see that modestly growing as we work to expand coverage. On Slide 12, we provide an update on our capital allocation. Slide 13 shows our updated 2024 financial guidance. We are raising our full year revenue outlook by $3 billion to be between $45.4 million and $46.6 billion. This increase is due to strong performance across our non-incretin medicines as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound. Additionally, we have improved clarity into the timing and pace of our production expansion and Mounjaro launches outside the U.S. We achieved a number of supply-related milestones in Q2 and have increased confidence regarding our expectation that production of salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the salable doses taken half of 2023. Based on the midpoint of the range, our updated guidance implies revenue growth of 38% in the second half of the year, below 31% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect a more significant growth in Q4 compared to Q3. Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 36% to 38% on a reported basis and 37% to 39% on a non-GAAP basis. For other income and expense, we now expect between $525 million and $425 million of expense on a reported basis, and between $400 million and $300 million of expense on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect lower expected net interest expense and the reported range reflects net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 of '24. We have increased our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, driven by changes in our forecasted mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.10 to $15.60 on a reported basis $16.10 to $16.60 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges -- the updates mentioned earlier as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q2 of $0.24. The reported range includes a charge in Q2 of '24 associated with anticipated litigation payments. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D.\nDan Skovronsky: Thanks, Gordon. It's been another busy quarter. I'll start with comments on the Kisunla FDA approval, then the tirzepatide heart failure Phase 3 readout. Then finally, I'll cover the rest of the updates for the quarter. We are, of course, very excited about the FDA approval of Kisunla for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This followed the June Advisory Committee meeting where we had another chance to present and discuss the compelling data package characterizing the safety and efficacy of this medicine. We were pleased by the discussion of the FDA advisers, particularly with regard to our data supporting stopping of Kisunla therapy when amyloid plaques are removed to minimal levels. In our trial, nearly half of study participants completed their course of treatment with Kisunla in 12 months. We believe limited duration therapy, along with a once monthly infusion schedule, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions required. The vote was unanimously positive on all questions presented. Then a few weeks later, the FDA approved Kisunla, including labeling that physicians may consider stopping dosing of Kisunla based on reduction of amyloid plaques. Following the July approval, we launched Kisunla, and we're delighted to see that patients have already begun receiving this new Lilly medicine as part of clinical practice. We note that Kisunla is broadly covered for Medicare patients through approved CED registries. Regulatory reviews continue around the world with potential action yet this year in several countries. We're pleased to have recently received a positive opinion for genenimab from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. And finally, our Phase 3 prevention study, TRAILBLAZER ALS 3, continues to progress as planned. Moving to tirzepatide. On Slide 14, you'll see the recent positive results of our SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which evaluated tirzepatide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved detection fraction and obesity. This study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints for tirzepatide, maximum tolerated dose compared to placebo. In the first primary endpoint, tirzepatide reduced the risk of worsening heart failure by 38% compared to placebo as measured by a composite outcome of heart failure urgent visit or hospitalization, oral diuretic intensification or cardiovascular death. The median follow-up for this endpoint was 104 weeks. In the second primary endpoint, tirzepatide significantly improved heart failure symptoms and physical limitations compared to placebo as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questioner, KCCQ Clinical Summary score. Main changes from baseline in this measurement is 24.8 points for tirzepatide, while placebo was 15 points based on the efficacy as demand at 52 weeks. All key secondary endpoints were met in the study, including mean body weight reduction of 15.7% compared to 2.2% for placebo. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in the SUMMIT trial was consistent with previously reported tirzepatide studies, including SURMOUNT and SURPASS. We will present detailed results at an upcoming medical -- and submit to a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies starting later this year. In other updates across our portfolio, Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 6. Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. I'll start with updates in cardiometabolic health, which is the new name of our internal business, formerly known as Lilly diabetes and obesity. In June, we published detailed results for our Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we presented results at the American Diabetes Association Meeting. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Notably, in one of our key secondary endpoints, as shown on Slide 17, tirzepatide demonstrated that up to 51.5% of participants met the criteria for disease resolution of sleep apnea. We've now submitted tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity to the FDA as well as the EMA. We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation, and we expect U.S. regulatory action as early as the end of 2024, which will be dependent on the FDA granting priority review. Also, in June, we published results in the New England Journal from our Phase 2 trial of tirzepatide for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, with Stage 2 or Stage 3 fibrosis and we presented these results at the European Association for the Study of Donanemab. We are pleased to show that in a secondary endpoint, more than half of the patients taking tirzepatide achieved improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks as shown on Slide 18. We're engaged with regulatory authorities on a potential Phase 3 registration strategy, and we're also encouraged by the potential read-through of these results to retatrutide, which also showed significant improvements in liver fats in Phase 2. This quarter, we also announced top-line data from two Phase 3 trials for our once weekly insulin called efsitora alfa, the QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes each met their primary endpoints of non-inferior A1c reduction. QWINT-2 compared to efsitora once-daily insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin naive adults. QWINT-4 compared efsitora to insulin glargine for 26 weeks in adult previously treated with daily basal insulin and at least two injections per day of meal time line. In both QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 efsitora, was safe and well tolerated. Detailed trial results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting. We look forward to sharing additional data from the QWINT program later this year. We are pleased with our progress to provide breakthrough innovation to patients who require insulin, progressing our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist molecule in Phase 1 and investing in approaches aimed at disease modification for type 1 diabetes, such as -- cell therapy. In other late-phase updates, we've initiated Triumph outcomes, a Phase 3 trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and renal function for patients taking retatrutide. Earlier in our cardiometabolic pipeline, you'll see additional incretin molecules in Phase 1. Incretins are an important part of our portfolio strategy and having multiple molecules in clinical development offers us potential optionality as we look at opportunities to help patients across mechanisms, indications, dosages, formulations and treatment schedules. To highlight a few. GLP-1 NPA2 is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor designed for once daily oral administration. We expect this asset to move to Phase 2 later this year, so we now identify it on our pipeline slide whereas it had previously been listed as not disclosed. Given the diversity of indications to potentially pursue with incretins, we are excited about the possibility of having another oral option to help more patients with different diseases. We also highlight today the GLP-1 coagonist III, which is a next-generation dual agonist molecule and we are planning to explore weekly and monthly dosing given its longer halfway. Elsewhere in our cardiometabolic health portfolio, we have stopped development of our NRG4 agonist as the profile was insufficient for further clinical development. Turning to oncology. We are pleased that Jaypirca has now been approved in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors. In early phase oncology, we've initiated the Phase 1 trial for a second Nectin-4 ADC. We view this as an important target and having two compounds in the clinic provides more opportunities to improve outcomes for patients. We've also initiated a Phase 1 trial for our ADC targeting the folate receptor. This asset, which came from our acquisition of Mablink is the next-generation construct design -- efficacy at all fully receptor expression levels and with an improved therapeutic index relative to existing agents. We're also announcing that we've terminated the LOXO-783 program, which targeted PI3 kinase alpha. We evaluated the ongoing clinical data from the program and compared the molecule to next-generation candidates that we have progressed from our discovery efforts. We believe our next molecules have greater potential to benefit patients and we look forward to putting our next candidate into the clinic in 2025 and sharing more about its profile later this year. In immunology, we've now submitted mirikizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Japan. We've terminated development for our GITR agonist, antagonists due to insufficient efficacy. We also announced our acquisition of Morphic. And pending completion of the deal we plan to reflect the oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor, MORF-057, in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Finally, in neuroscience, our anti-tau small molecule OGA inhibitor, recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. OGA failed to meet the primary endpoint of decreasing the change of baseline as measured by -- in either of the two dose levels tested. We're reviewing the data for presentation of detailed results of the study at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's conference later this year. While this negative outcome is disappointing, we remain committed to TAP as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease and plan to continue studying Taobao. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks.\nDave Ricks : Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. Exceptional revenue growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. We are pleased with the ramp in production in the first half of the year and expect continued expansion ahead. Significant advances in our pipeline include the approval of Kisunla for Alzheimer's disease, the submission of tirzepatide for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the U.S. and Europe and positive results from the Phase 3 study of tirzepatide for heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. We are investing in product launches, the advancement of our pipeline as well as our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. All of this and the incredible work of our teams around the world give Lilly leadership confidence that we have a very bright future ahead and better opportunity than at any time in our company's history to impact human health on a global scale. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session.\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and to conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions]. So, Paul, please provide the instructions for the Q&A, and we're ready for the first caller.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus your line is live.\nSeamus Fernandez: Great. Thanks so much. And just I'll stick with my one question. It really is on your awareness of ASP movements in the market, so the average selling price. By our calculations, when we sort of look at the ASP averages, removing rebates, inventory, et cetera, relative to comments made yesterday on Novo's call, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the market with regard to average selling price. The prices look actually reasonably close to us with the tirzepatide franchise having higher sort of ASP per script, but not dramatically higher given concerns of real pricing deterioration. I guess the only question that I have here is, what are you seeing from an ASP perspective? And do you see this as kind of a natural evolution of this market as competition emergence as we saw with Ozempic historically and Trulicity in 2019? Thanks so much.\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Seamus. I think I'll go to Gordon. Do you want to touch on that, or Patrick?\nGordon Brooks: Sure. I'll hang -- with that. Seamus, thanks for the question. Yes. So just on price streams, initial favorability in the first half of the year was driven by Mounjaro. That goes away in the second half of the year as the co-pay program moves out of the base period. In terms of pricing, we see stable pricing sequentially across quarters in '24. So, nothing unusual, Q1 to Q2 and our guidance Q3 and Q4 continue stable sequential pricing. For the second half of the year when you don't have the Mounjaro dynamic pricing in the second half will be similar to prior year pricing. So those are kind of the dynamics we see in pricing.\nOperator: The next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence your line is live.\nTerence Flynn: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress on the manufacturing. Maybe just a two-part for me on that one. Just wondering if you're unit guidance for the at least 1.5-fold increase in sellable doses include the Zepbound bound star vials that you're rolling out in the U.S. or if that's a potential driver of upside? And then as we think about RTP, I know you continue to make progress there. The scripts suggests you're at about 1/3 of the way through the ramp to peak. But this inventory restock that you talked about today suggests maybe more of a meaningful step-up. So just can you quantify for us where you are in the ramp in RTP? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher : Yes, sure. I think, Dave, do you want to hop in and...\nDave Ricks: Yes, I can just can -- So I think what we're saying today is just reiterating the 1.5 is sort of like a floor on how we think about second half volume. I would say the vials are part of that. But given the -- we have about 20 weeks left in the year. So, there's a limit to how much of that will ship anyway. But they certainly open up a node of the most constrained part of the supply chain, which is still finish in the final container closure and it uses different lines obviously, then syringes or cartridges. So, it just adds to our capacity, probably the most meaningful part of that will show up in the early '25 to be honest, as that new form ramps and details on that rollout will be coming in the coming weeks. As it relates to RTP, I wouldn't read through that the Q2 step-up in volume we shipped was primarily to RTP. That site is on track, and we are steadily escalating production per our goals. I also mentioned Concord is doing well against its time schedule, and we expect product out of that site end of this year, early next year. But rather, maybe performance out of the totality of the network that allowed us to recover wholesaler inventory levels in Q2 and now come off the FDA shortage list. It's more just overall performance across many, many nodes of our supply network.\nOperator: The next question will be from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Chris your line is live.\nChris Schott: And congrats all the progress. There seems to be a broader debate on the role emerging earlier-stage competition in the obesity market could play where that fits in the market broadly. I'm sure you're not surprised by the breadth of agents being developed in the space. But just interested in your latest views in terms of barriers to entry you see for some of these newer competitors and how you think about defending Lilly's market position over time? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher : Maybe, Dan, do you want to start on that? And then...\nDan Skovronsky: Yes, I'll start some R&D comments on BarCentry. The first, I think, is having a successful drug in Phase 3 clinical trials and getting it approved. You can see that we've invested thoroughly, I would say, in our Phase 3 portfolio is often pursuing multiple indications in multiple populations at once. Just being able to get to that point, I know investors have gotten excited about various releases of Phase 1 data. But it's still a challenging space to develop drugs and we usually wait until we've seen pretty robust Phase 2 data before we get too excited about a particular molecule. So that's the first thing. And I think a lot of the news we've seen from different companies only sort out as we get to see Phase 2 data and which molecules make it and which have the right profile and which don't. But I wouldn't be expecting 100% success here.\nPatrik Jonsson: A few additional comments. I think when we look at the marketplace, about two are very important barriers. We have been extremely successful in gaining access across both Mounjaro, where we are currently 93% access in commercial and 89% in Part D. And similarly, for Zepbound, 86% after 7 months in the marketplace, that's quite significant. The second piece is the amount of outcome indications. We are investing heavily in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, and similarly for the Phase 3 assets of our Zepbound and retatrutide. So, I think, overall, we think that we are extremely well positioned to compete here. And we are not surprised to see that most of the firms are actually leaning into this very important space. But with the cost we have not had in the market today, the Phase 3 assets and what we referred in the prepared remarks, we are well positioned to compete today and tomorrow. And that -- both different indications, assets Gene [ph] therapy, et cetera, all hands-on deck on our side.\nDave Ricks: Maybe one last thing -- follow-on. But here, we're highlighting our [indiscernible] 11 assets, all different targets. And maybe just a reminder, Chris, we had our Phase 1 MAD data for tirzepatide in 2016, that was 8 years ago. And that's a massive lead, I think, over other GIP/GLP agonists that are behind us. On the oral side, you can get more in category differentiation based on target engagement, safety profile, et cetera. But here, again, we have the most advanced program, and as Dan highlighted today, a follow-on program to add to that sort of portfolio we have there. And finally, one other, I don't know if it's barrier, but certainly is work to do is scaling manufacturing. The volume is really high in this category, probably will end up being one of the highest volume categories in the history of the industry. And you're talking about making things on the $1 billion scale, which takes time and it's technically difficult and very capital intensive. So of course, competitors will come. But there's a road ahead for all these that -- the two leading companies have already walked in large part.\nOperator: The next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. Tim your line is live.\nTim Anderson: I have a question on compounders of GLP-1s, including, but not limited to, your tirzepatide. So, companies like IMS or anyone else. How can this not infringe patent protection? And is this something that is likely to get adjudicated in the courts, meaning the you and presumably Novo, too? So, an article just yesterday in New York Times talked about patients getting upside down with compounded GLP-1s. I think they used the term overdosing on these compounded formulations. So not only do compounders take away sales from you guys, but it could also turn -- reputation of the class. So, what can we expect Lilly to do about it?\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Tim. Dan, you want to start with some comments?\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks for raising this important topic, Tim. Of course, we've been watching this carefully, not really out of concern that they're taking away our business. We've been largely supply constraint here, but rather the impact it's having on patient health. We often are able to secure samples from these kinds of compounding labs and analyze them in our own labs. And what we found for the most part, in most instances is this isn't kind of tirzepatide at all. Our drug is not available to compounders, rather they're purchasing either other chemicals entirely, which we often find or make producers of tirzepatide that is often full of impurities sometimes contaminated by bacteria. This is a safety risk to patients that we take seriously and try to think we can to make patients aware of the potential dangers here so that we can help.\nDave Ricks: Yes. And just from a policy standpoint, I mean, you can expect us to be active here. We've taken public positions. We're obviously engaged with regulators and considering all kinds of legal actions and filed some. Of course, compounding is a long-standing practice under the 503A provisions of FDA, which is meant to customize doses for individual patient needs that we don't -- it's not clear to me medically what that would be for tirzepatide. But I guess that's legal in a sense. It's the mass production that's concerning. And we don't see a lot of that with our medicine more with the other one. But I think if we just step back and reflect them why the -- there's shortages because of parenteral manufacturing constraints in the industry and the lead companies. A lot of that constraint is investing and proving those processes are compliant with the GMP standards that the FDA and Europe or NX1 have enforced. And we agree, by the way, with that strict enforcement. So, it's a little odd that the answer to that constraint, which is about raising the standards of the industry to a sterile product is to create another industry that is non-sterile product. So, we're just pointing that out. And I think you can see Lilly on the front foot here over the coming months to address this. But ultimately, the real thing to address is the increasing coverage on insurance and increasing supply. We -- drive on supply. We'll step that up another notch with the availability of vials, and we need to work with primarily the government as well as employers to expand coverage. So OBC medicines are affordable. People when we get to those points, this will be an issue. But in the meantime, people can get hurt. And as Dan said, it's pretty concerning what's happening.\nOperator: Next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer your line is live.\nUmer Raffat: Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask on operating leverage, if I may. I know in the first quarter, when you guys raised the guidance by $2 billion on top line, it dropped down to EPS by $1.30. This quarter, guidance went up by $3 billion, but it dropped down at a much higher leverage at $2.16 EPS, almost a 90% incremental margin. And my question is not so much what your operating leverage is going to be in 2025 or a forward year guidance. But instead, I'm basically asking if you annualize the momentum of your 4Q numbers per this year's guidance, the EPS upside implied to consensus could be almost as much as half of Lilly's entire full year EPS where it stands right now. So, I'm just trying to think through, how do you plan on spending on various functions and what the incremental margins could look like as the revenue momentum really kicks in with the improving supply?\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Umer. There's a lot of financial mechanics. So, I'll hand to Gordon to comment on, I think, effectively capital allocation considerations.\nGordon Brooks: Good. Thanks. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, we've been speaking for a long time about operating margins and getting to the mid- to high 30% range. As we've seen this year, Mounjaro and Zepbound are taking an inflection point upwards and so we're seeing ourselves at the top end of that range. For the first half, margins are a little inflated. We haven't yet lend in to all of our promotional channels and incretins. You don't see, for instance, TV commercials in the incretins. We haven't done that looking at the -- given the supply situation. And in R&D, it takes time to scale R&D thoughtfully. So, it doesn't always move exactly in sync quarter-by-quarter with revenue. That said, our guidance for the year does indicate we will stay in the upper 30% range for the full year, with growth first half, if you look at the first half, as the two quarters' growth into the second half. And you should also expect to see within that mix, stronger sales and marketing growth as we get to new launches in the second part of the year and the R&D continue to scale the growth from what we've seen thus far. So those are the dynamics we see on operating margin for 2024.\nOperator: The next question will be from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Mohit your line is live.\nMohit Bansal: Great. Thank you, very much for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. My question is regarding the rest of the world sales for incretins. It seems like Mounjaro is doing quite well there. And if I take out the -- like 15% or so for stocking in the U.S., it seems like ex-U.S. is already about 33% this early in the launch. So, I would love to understand how has been your experience so far? And is there going to be any different uptake for ex-U.S. versus your prior generation incretins for both Mounjaro and Zepbound given that these are really efficacious drugs?\nJoe Fletcher : Yes. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. Ilya, do you want to comment on OUS rollout for Mounjaro?\nIlya Yuffa: Sure. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. We've seen some great progress with the launch of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. I think what you've seen in terms of growth in the earlier launch countries, such as the U.K., UAE and Saudi, UAE and Saudi are both key markets that make up rest of world, have already achieved a leading share and continue to drive momentum and overall market growth. And so, as you take a look at Q2, the main driver of that growth has been in Mounjaro in markets where we've already launched earlier in the cycle and majority of that coming from the Quick Pen presentation with a lot of that in the UAE. Some of that is channel dynamics similar to the U.S. At the same time, if you take a look at Q2 and the trajectory for Q2 relative to historical peak sales of any of our brand, has already surpassed that with a limited number of markets where we've launched. And so, as we look at the coming quarters, obviously, we just recently launched in Germany and now also Spain with Quick Pen presentation. We'll also look and monitor the demand and also supply capacity and expect to launch in new markets. The near-term growth, I would expect predominantly coming from already launched markets of Mounjaro.\nOperator: The next question will be from Alex Hammond from Bank of America. Alex your line is live.\nAlex Hammond : Thanks for taking my question. In the prepared remarks, Dan mentioned engagement with regulatory authorities on a potential pivotal trial in NASH. Can you provide any color on these discussions and how Lilly is thinking about tirzepatide versus -- for this indication? When could we receive updates? Thank you.\nJoe Fletcher : Dan?\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about the opportunity to help patients suffering from NASH. I think the data that we shared in Phase 2 for tirzepatide appetite is really quite profound in terms of the size of effect we can have. There's a couple of issues in mass drug development that we're trying to tackle, probably the most significant of which is current standard of liver biopsy to identify the patients to enroll in these trials and also then measure the outcome. Liver biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure and difficult to find patients to consent to these trials and of course, there's risk to patients. We're working hard to develop noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify the right patients to enroll in mass studies and also potentially could be used as an outcome to know if a drug is working. My hope is that we could develop those kinds of biomarkers that could be used both purposes and could be suitable for accelerated or approval of mass drugs in the future. Of course, long-term traditional approval for Astra still requires demonstration of outcomes. So, in that environment, we have two drugs that I think could both be great mass drugs and we'll have to decide whether to invest in one or both of those drugs, depending on the regulatory path we see. We'll keep investors updated as we make decisions about these molecules in mesh.\nOperator: The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan your line is live.\nEvan Seigerman: Hi, guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on manufacturing and specifically, on the concern that you raised back in February around the proposed acquisition of Catalent by Novo Holdings and the subsequent sale to Novo Nordisk. Are you still as concerned as you were in February? Or given what you've been able to do with your own footprint? Is this less of an issue?\nDave Ricks: Yes, I can take it. We remain concerned about that transaction. I don't think it was ever really about the trajectory of our ramp, although as we've disclosed, we do rely on one of the Catalent sites for GLP-1 and other diabetes production. It's more the oddity of your main competitor being also your contract manufacturer and how to resolve that situation. There's also an industry structure issue. CDMOs are important for managing capacity across the sector. And if we ended up in an outcome where that sector didn't really exist, they all became captive of large pharma would really constrain, I think, availability in the development of medicines, particularly out of biotech. So, we've aired those concerns publicly and privately since the proposed transaction was announced, and we're waiting to see what happens. But in terms of the long-term outlook for our company, as you may have noticed, we're building aggressively ourselves. Our primary strategy is self-run sites. And we've got $18 billion we've announced in the last several years, probably not done there. And we're quite comfortable building operating sites and as the newest large sites of begun to come online, we know we can execute that drill and repeat it, and that's our base plan.\nOperator: The next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink. Dave your line is live.\nDavid Risinger : Let me add my congrats on the results as well and the corporate updates. So Zepbound's breadth of health and work or productivity benefits seem to be underappreciated by many. There are articles from time to time, let's say, that patients need an off-ramp from therapy, et cetera. And my question is, what is Lilly doing to encourage patients to stay persistent with therapy? And how does Lilly intend to better communicate not just Zepbound's health benefits, but its worker productivity benefits to employers in order to drive much greater employer inclusion of obesity drugs as part of employee benefits?\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Dave. Patrik, do you want to comment on persistency and benefits?\nPatrik Jonsson : Absolutely. I think first overall, when we look at persistency, it's very early after the launch. But based on the feedback we have from providers, and from patients as well, this is a drug that patients want to stay on because they experience the benefits -- weight loss and also the downstream implications on comorbidities. You're right, the employee opt-in efforts are extremely key, and we believe that our outcome data, OSA, now have -- will help us tremendously and more readout to come over the coming years. We're also having value-based agreement with several other payers where we are looking into the benefits of tirzepatide in the workplace in terms of reduced absentees, increased productivity, et cetera, as well and that has gained a lot of interest. In terms of the consumer, yes, the ease to start and stay on is a key priority for us. And then we're working with consumer, improving our consumer platforms and also digital channels to really enable patients to experience the benefits that Zepbound provides over time.\nOperator: The next question will be from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. Kerry your line is live.\nKerry Holford : Just coming back to the margin question earlier, given another expense in the 2024...\nOperator: Apologies team. We will get Kerry reconnected with a better line momentarily. And we'll move on to the next question, in the meantime, if that's okay from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Chris your line is live.\nChris Shibutani : With all the different oral mechanisms in particular, variations on it from yourselves as well as competitors, can you update us on your thinking on what the basis of competition is going to be? And what kind of opportunities do you really envision? I think there has been for a while now a comparison on the basis of percent weight loss, particularly for the injectables. But as we move into orals, it seems as if tolerability profiles really matter. So how are you thinking about it? And how do you recommend investors think when we compare datasets across these other oral products in development? Even if the mechanisms are different, how do we get smarter about differentiating and interpreting data?\nJoe Fletcher : Dan, you want to chime in?\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks. I'll start, and then we'll see Patrik to anything to add on commercial differentiation. But in the clinical trials, I think first of all, as I'm saying before, just take some caution on the small short Phase I trials. There's more to see. Most of the drugs that we've seen actually aren't different mechanisms that are GLP-1 agonists. In this class, I don't expect there to be differentiation in terms of efficacy, weight loss. You can pretty much dial in the amount of weight loss you want depending on how aggressively you dose it and what population. Tolerability is another issue that usually comes along with the efficacy. The faster you ramp to higher doses, the less tolerability you have. Then the different companies have to work through their own escalation of dosing to match the desired efficacy with some reasonable tolerability. The variable that links those two things together is often the half-life of the molecule. So shorter half-life molecules will give you bigger peak trough -- in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. And we think that's what -- that drives the tolerability issues. So, what you want is a long half-life molecule that can be dose escalated more smoothly. So that probably will be the differentiation rather than anything that companies are currently talking about in terms of efficacy. As I said before, it's a long road from early data to Phase 3 clinical trials like we have with orforglipron and we can expect some attrition. I'm pretty excited also about next-generation molecule. All of these ones that we've been talking about now are GLP-1s and will offer efficacy sort of in the range of injectable semaglutide. I think ultimately, we'd like to see drugs that offer efficacy and tolerability that exceeds that things that could combine multiple incretins like tirzepatide does and we are certainly working on orals that could also agonize GIP-1, for example. So exciting progress there and more to come on that in the future for us.\nPatrik Jonsson: Just from a commercial point of view, we are regularly conducting both consumer and provider market research. And when we're looking into the preferences, the true drivers today is still the degree of weight loss and safety and tolerability. And when we look at the needs beyond that, it's actually the need of an oral, and an oral with an injectable-like efficacy. So that's probably the new that comes beyond what we're currently serving today and particularly to serve those patients that have a fear of injections. When we look at over aspects, I think what comes beyond that would be the compensation of weight loss, lean mass versus fats and durability. And I think we are looking into all of those aspects as well.\nJoe Fletcher : I know we're running short on time. So, we'll do our best to kind of compress our answers as we get through as many questions as possible.\nOperator: And we have Kerry Holford from Bernberg reconnected. Kerry your line is live.\nKerry Holford: Hopefully, you can hear me better this time around.\nJoe Fletcher : Much better.\nKerry Holford: Lovely. My question was on margins. So, given you are now landing -- expecting to land in that mid- to high 30s range this year -- after the Zepbound launches, where can we expect your midterm operating margin plan? Is the margin in the mid-40%, perhaps higher achievable? And Dave, I know you previously suggested that an operating margin above 40% is not sustainable from an innovation-focused company. But given your progress so far, I wonder if you've changed your view on that.\nJoe Fletcher : Gordon, do you want to touch on that briefly?\nGordon Brooks: Will do. Thanks, Kerry. I appreciate the question. Yes. I think as we said, like dance, as I said earlier, we do expect to end in that upper 30s range this year. There's still a lot at play here. Yes, on the top line, we see inflection points on revenue. But through the first half, you've had an inflated position. We haven't yet leaned in to any of our promotional channels. That's going to be a dynamic that we lean to more starting in the second half. And R&D, we do intend to scale that, and that's not going quarter-by-quarter exactly in line with revenue. So, all of those things are still going to play through. I think that said, at this point, we're just talking about 2024. And when we do guidance for '25, we'll chat about the longer-term picture there.\nOperator: The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash your line is live.\nAkash Tewari : So, we're starting to see that -- may not be the only way to kind of preserve lean muscle mass. In particular, it looks like Amlin GLP combos are showing the potential for maybe 90% versus 10% fat versus muscle loss. Can you talk about what you think Aloralintide to Zepbound combo could show both in terms of absolute weight loss, but also the quality of that weight loss? And then where would -- fit in a world where next-gen -- triplet could show that level of muscle preservation?\nJoe Fletcher : Dan can focus on that first question about oral [indiscernible].\nDan Skovronsky: So, we have multiple mechanisms in play here, starting maybe with the amylin. We have a molecule Phase 2 called Aloralintide, which is a pure AML agonist, and we're evaluating that both as monotherapy and in combination with tirzepatide GLP clip. So that will be interesting to see. I don't have a strong preconceived notions about what to expect in terms of lean versus fat mass loss with that particular combination. Probably the people who have the most data about that would be the scientists at Novo since they've investigated cricalutide in combination with semaglutide. I think that brings us probably to another mechanism, which is dual amylin calcitonin agonism, which crugilatide probably is a dual agonist, and we have a molecule like that in Phase 1 called DACRA and we'll also investigate that and composition of biomass will be one of the aspects in which we evaluate it. And then finally, you talk of myostatin, we have a molecule in this family, and that's the bimagrumab that we acquired from Versatis, which is an antibiotic -- and that's proceeding in a Phase 2 trial in combination with semaglutide. And we look forward to having data to share with that in the future. All of these mechanisms, I think, could have variable effects on body mass composition. I point out that so far, we've not seen any disadvantages to the types of weight loss that we get with tirzepatide. In fact, patients show improved functional outcomes on a variety of things, including fruit function and heart failures we just demonstrated. So, could we have further improvements with even more higher ratio of fat to lean mass? That's the question of these trials makes\nOperator: The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. Trung your line is live.\nTrung Huynh : Thank for taking my question. Just following on from the previous question on ex-U.S. GLP-1. You saw Mounjaro ex-U.S. sales this quarter jumped to $677 million from $286 million. Can you give us some color on how ex-U.S. reimbursement is going with the bigger countries? And is this more of an out-of-pocket drug in these countries? And what percentage of the 677 million is obesity sales versus diabetes?\nJoe Fletcher : Okay. On that second one, I don't think we'll probably give much of a good answer on that. So, I'll maybe ask Ilya to weigh in just on that first question around how ex-U.S. reimbursement is going.\nIlya Yuffa: Sure. Well, of course, I think the momentum overall is progressing quite nicely in both the reimbursed as well as the out-of-pocket segments. We have achieved reimbursement in the U.K. We have reimbursement in Germany, and we're continuing to look for reimbursement and expand reimbursement in other markets that we've launched. We have some reimbursement in UAE in Saudi as well in type 2 diabetes. And we continue to expand on that in the markets that we will enter. But a lot of that momentum is covering both the Type 2 and chronically management market and both in the reimbursed and out-of-pocket segment, and we're seeing both the progress in share as well as market expansion in the markets that we've been in.\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks, Ilya. Paul, I know we have a lot in the queue. Maybe we just have two more questions and then wrap things up.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve your line is live.\nSteve Scala : Thank you so much. The FDA definition of shortage seems clear and tirzepatide no longer meeting the definition of shortage seems to imply Lilly is meeting demand. I assume you will say that that's not the case, but the definition at least in black and white is quite clear. I assume this is FDA's determination. So, does Lilly agree with FDA's conclusion? How is demand being met? How is demand being measured? And what does demand look like?\nDave Ricks : Yes. Thanks for the important question. As we think about the compounding question is important as well. As we've said earlier, we're available in all dosage forms in the U.S. What that means is, as you know, we can fill orders as they receive versus what we're doing. That does not mean that any pharmacy or certainly every pharmacy has all 12 dosage forms sitting on their shelf. That's infeasible economically probably for a lot of them and even logistically. So, I think we'll continue to see because there's not an abundance of supply. It's more of a real-time fulfillment situation, patients going to pharmacy counters and being told to wait a few days while their orders filled. But product is flowing and it's flowing at a pretty high rate. We're shipping part of it, and you can see that in these results from the quarter. So, files will add to that picture, but demand will increase as well. So, I think we're doing well given the situation. But the end pharmacy experience will continue to be choppy. We point that out to the FDA. So that means people may call and say, I couldn't get what I want on the moment I wanted it at the pharmacy I choose to. That's not the definition that we think applies here. So, we'll continue to with channel partners and the agency to try to clear up the confusion and improve the consumer experience, which is our responsibility along with theirs.\nOperator: Last question today will be from Louise Chen from Cantor. Louise your line is live.\nLouise Chen : Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you how excited you are about this muscle preserving obesity drugs and if you see that as a true unmet need?\nJoe Fletcher : Thanks. Dan, anything to add on?\nDan Skovronsky: Yes. No, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's an interesting area of science for sure. Too soon to know exactly how these kinds of mechanisms will translate into benefits for patients. At a high level, we know that the ratio of lean mass to fat mass is really important in determining metabolic health, probably more important as an indicator of overall metabolic health than, for example, BMI. And so that's what spurs these kinds of efforts to increase lean mass while causing fat mass loss and we'll wait to see data from our own donanemab and wait to see how that translates into health benefits for patients.\nJoe Fletcher : Great. So, I think we'll wrap up. Dave, closing remarks.\nDave Ricks : Great. Thanks, Joe, and thanks to the team here. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please follow up with the Investor Relations team if you have any questions we didn't address, and it sounds like there's a few that are holding. Happy to answer all of those.

            "name": "Dave Ricks",
            "content": "Thanks, Joe. It's an exciting time here at Lilly as our growth trajectory accelerated in the second quarter. Our investments in advancing innovative medicine are focused on manufacturing expansion are bringing Lilly medicines to more people around the world. On Slide 5, you can see details of the financial performance in the second quarter and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 36% in Q2 with our new products growing nearly $3.5 billion compared to the same period last year. U.S. demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound is strong and growing as access and supply continue to expand. While weekly prescription volume was volatile in the first half of the year due to challenges fulfilling high demand, our progress on supply gives us confidence in our outlook. Q2 saw impressive performance across other areas of the business as well. Excluding the sale of the rights to Baqsimi last year, non-incretin growth was 17% worldwide with growth spread across geographies, including 25% growth in the United States. And our $3 billion increase in revenue guidance reflects our expectation that momentum will accelerate through the balance of the year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the approval of Kisunla, the brand name for donanemab in the U.S. for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, the approval of Jaypirca in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors, the submission of tirzepatide in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity and the positive top line results from the SUMMIT Phase 3 trial evaluating tirzepatide in adults with heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. Lilly now has a significant opportunity to create new medicines through a broad internal portfolio and active business development to support our long-term growth. In obesity, our strategy is to comprehensively address this global public health crisis, pursuing opportunities against every rational mechanism, indication and dosage form. We are investing broadly in this disease and now have 11 new molecules currently in the clinic across multiple indications. We're also investing in a wide range of late-stage Phase 3 programs. We recently shared the positive data of tirzepatide in OSA and -- Orforglipron, our oral GLP-1 small molecule, has a comprehensive Phase 3 program underway in diabetes and obesity with nine trials currently running and readout starting next year. With tirzepatide, our GIP/GLP-1 glucan try agonist. We have initiated a broad Phase 3 development program studying the molecule in obesity, OSA, osteoarthritis, cardiovascular and renal outcomes as well as type 2 diabetes. These readouts start in 2026. Our top priority remains executing on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. In May, we announced plans to invest an additional $5.3 billion in our Lebanon, Indiana manufacturing sites, bringing our total investment there to $9 billion. We believe this is the largest single investment in synthetic medicine active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing in the history of the United States. Importantly, this expansion will enhance capacity to manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for Zepbound and Mounjaro. Since 2020, we have committed more than $18 billion to build, upgrade or acquire facilities in the U.S. and Europe, and we began to see the benefit of these investments. We are making near-term progress to ramp production, including at new sites like Research Trial Park, existing Lilly sites and contract manufacturing organizations. Our Concur North Carolina site is progressing well. We're in the process of running validation and expect this facility will initiate production by the end of 2024 with product available to ship in 2025. We also continue to make progress on different presentations for tirzepatide. We have now launched our multidose quick pen in multiple markets outside the U.S. with positive early indicators of patient adoption. And in Gordon's remarks, he will preview our plans to launch vials here in the U.S. Lastly, in terms of external innovation. In July, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Morphic, a biopharma company developing oral -- therapies for treatment of serious chronic diseases, including a Phase 2 asset being evaluated in inflammatory bowel disease. On Slide 6, you'll see a list of key events since our Q1 call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates. As we announced in June, Anat Ashkenazi resigned as Lilly's Chief Financial Officer to become the CFO of Alphabet. We wish Anat well in her new role and thank her for your partnership and leadership of our financial organization in the last 3 years. We have named Gordon Brooks Interim CFO as an internal and external search for Anat successor is currently underway. Gordon has been with the company for 29 years and also serves as our controller and the leader of the corporate strategy group for the company. In other leadership news, Alonzo Weems, our Executive Vice President of Enterprise Risk Management and our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, will retire at the end of the year after 27 years of service. And Melissa Seymour has joined the company as Executive Vice President of Global Quality and a member of the company's executive committee following John Norton's recent retirement. I want to thank Alonzo for his many years of service and welcome Melissa to the Lilly team. Now let me turn the call over to Gordon to review our Q2 financial results. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up our progress in the second quarter. Exceptional revenue growth in Q2 was driven by Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. We are pleased with the ramp in production in the first half of the year and expect continued expansion ahead. Significant advances in our pipeline include the approval of Kisunla for Alzheimer's disease, the submission of tirzepatide for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the U.S. and Europe and positive results from the Phase 3 study of tirzepatide for heart failure with preserved injection fraction and obesity. We are investing in product launches, the advancement of our pipeline as well as our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. All of this and the incredible work of our teams around the world give Lilly leadership confidence that we have a very bright future ahead and better opportunity than at any time in our company's history to impact human health on a global scale. Now I'll turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Yes, I can just can -- So I think what we're saying today is just reiterating the 1.5 is sort of like a floor on how we think about second half volume. I would say the vials are part of that. But given the -- we have about 20 weeks left in the year. So, there's a limit to how much of that will ship anyway. But they certainly open up a node of the most constrained part of the supply chain, which is still finish in the final container closure and it uses different lines obviously, then syringes or cartridges. So, it just adds to our capacity, probably the most meaningful part of that will show up in the early '25 to be honest, as that new form ramps and details on that rollout will be coming in the coming weeks. As it relates to RTP, I wouldn't read through that the Q2 step-up in volume we shipped was primarily to RTP. That site is on track, and we are steadily escalating production per our goals. I also mentioned Concord is doing well against its time schedule, and we expect product out of that site end of this year, early next year. But rather, maybe performance out of the totality of the network that allowed us to recover wholesaler inventory levels in Q2 and now come off the FDA shortage list. It's more just overall performance across many, many nodes of our supply network. Maybe one last thing -- follow-on. But here, we're highlighting our [indiscernible] 11 assets, all different targets. And maybe just a reminder, Chris, we had our Phase 1 MAD data for tirzepatide in 2016, that was 8 years ago. And that's a massive lead, I think, over other GIP/GLP agonists that are behind us. On the oral side, you can get more in category differentiation based on target engagement, safety profile, et cetera. But here, again, we have the most advanced program, and as Dan highlighted today, a follow-on program to add to that sort of portfolio we have there. And finally, one other, I don't know if it's barrier, but certainly is work to do is scaling manufacturing. The volume is really high in this category, probably will end up being one of the highest volume categories in the history of the industry. And you're talking about making things on the $1 billion scale, which takes time and it's technically difficult and very capital intensive. So of course, competitors will come. But there's a road ahead for all these that -- the two leading companies have already walked in large part. Yes. And just from a policy standpoint, I mean, you can expect us to be active here. We've taken public positions. We're obviously engaged with regulators and considering all kinds of legal actions and filed some. Of course, compounding is a long-standing practice under the 503A provisions of FDA, which is meant to customize doses for individual patient needs that we don't -- it's not clear to me medically what that would be for tirzepatide. But I guess that's legal in a sense. It's the mass production that's concerning. And we don't see a lot of that with our medicine more with the other one. But I think if we just step back and reflect them why the -- there's shortages because of parenteral manufacturing constraints in the industry and the lead companies. A lot of that constraint is investing and proving those processes are compliant with the GMP standards that the FDA and Europe or NX1 have enforced. And we agree, by the way, with that strict enforcement. So, it's a little odd that the answer to that constraint, which is about raising the standards of the industry to a sterile product is to create another industry that is non-sterile product. So, we're just pointing that out. And I think you can see Lilly on the front foot here over the coming months to address this. But ultimately, the real thing to address is the increasing coverage on insurance and increasing supply. We -- drive on supply. We'll step that up another notch with the availability of vials, and we need to work with primarily the government as well as employers to expand coverage. So OBC medicines are affordable. People when we get to those points, this will be an issue. But in the meantime, people can get hurt. And as Dan said, it's pretty concerning what's happening. Yes, I can take it. We remain concerned about that transaction. I don't think it was ever really about the trajectory of our ramp, although as we've disclosed, we do rely on one of the Catalent sites for GLP-1 and other diabetes production. It's more the oddity of your main competitor being also your contract manufacturer and how to resolve that situation. There's also an industry structure issue. CDMOs are important for managing capacity across the sector. And if we ended up in an outcome where that sector didn't really exist, they all became captive of large pharma would really constrain, I think, availability in the development of medicines, particularly out of biotech. So, we've aired those concerns publicly and privately since the proposed transaction was announced, and we're waiting to see what happens. But in terms of the long-term outlook for our company, as you may have noticed, we're building aggressively ourselves. Our primary strategy is self-run sites. And we've got $18 billion we've announced in the last several years, probably not done there. And we're quite comfortable building operating sites and as the newest large sites of begun to come online, we know we can execute that drill and repeat it, and that's our base plan. Yes. Thanks for the important question. As we think about the compounding question is important as well. As we've said earlier, we're available in all dosage forms in the U.S. What that means is, as you know, we can fill orders as they receive versus what we're doing. That does not mean that any pharmacy or certainly every pharmacy has all 12 dosage forms sitting on their shelf. That's infeasible economically probably for a lot of them and even logistically. So, I think we'll continue to see because there's not an abundance of supply. It's more of a real-time fulfillment situation, patients going to pharmacy counters and being told to wait a few days while their orders filled. But product is flowing and it's flowing at a pretty high rate. We're shipping part of it, and you can see that in these results from the quarter. So, files will add to that picture, but demand will increase as well. So, I think we're doing well given the situation. But the end pharmacy experience will continue to be choppy. We point that out to the FDA. So that means people may call and say, I couldn't get what I want on the moment I wanted it at the pharmacy I choose to. That's not the definition that we think applies here. So, we'll continue to with channel partners and the agency to try to clear up the confusion and improve the consumer experience, which is our responsibility along with theirs. Great. Thanks, Joe, and thanks to the team here. We appreciate your participation in today's earnings call and your interest in Eli Lilly and Company. Please follow up with the Investor Relations team if you have any questions we didn't address, and it sounds like there's a few that are holding. Happy to answer all of those. Have a great day, everyone."

            "name": "Dan Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Gordon. It's been another busy quarter. I'll start with comments on the Kisunla FDA approval, then the tirzepatide heart failure Phase 3 readout. Then finally, I'll cover the rest of the updates for the quarter. We are, of course, very excited about the FDA approval of Kisunla for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This followed the June Advisory Committee meeting where we had another chance to present and discuss the compelling data package characterizing the safety and efficacy of this medicine. We were pleased by the discussion of the FDA advisers, particularly with regard to our data supporting stopping of Kisunla therapy when amyloid plaques are removed to minimal levels. In our trial, nearly half of study participants completed their course of treatment with Kisunla in 12 months. We believe limited duration therapy, along with a once monthly infusion schedule, could result in lower patient out-of-pocket treatment costs and fewer infusions required. The vote was unanimously positive on all questions presented. Then a few weeks later, the FDA approved Kisunla, including labeling that physicians may consider stopping dosing of Kisunla based on reduction of amyloid plaques. Following the July approval, we launched Kisunla, and we're delighted to see that patients have already begun receiving this new Lilly medicine as part of clinical practice. We note that Kisunla is broadly covered for Medicare patients through approved CED registries. Regulatory reviews continue around the world with potential action yet this year in several countries. We're pleased to have recently received a positive opinion for genenimab from the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan. And finally, our Phase 3 prevention study, TRAILBLAZER ALS 3, continues to progress as planned. Moving to tirzepatide. On Slide 14, you'll see the recent positive results of our SUMMIT Phase 3 trial, which evaluated tirzepatide for the treatment of heart failure with preserved detection fraction and obesity. This study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary endpoints for tirzepatide, maximum tolerated dose compared to placebo. In the first primary endpoint, tirzepatide reduced the risk of worsening heart failure by 38% compared to placebo as measured by a composite outcome of heart failure urgent visit or hospitalization, oral diuretic intensification or cardiovascular death. The median follow-up for this endpoint was 104 weeks. In the second primary endpoint, tirzepatide significantly improved heart failure symptoms and physical limitations compared to placebo as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questioner, KCCQ Clinical Summary score. Main changes from baseline in this measurement is 24.8 points for tirzepatide, while placebo was 15 points based on the efficacy as demand at 52 weeks. All key secondary endpoints were met in the study, including mean body weight reduction of 15.7% compared to 2.2% for placebo. The overall safety profile of tirzepatide in the SUMMIT trial was consistent with previously reported tirzepatide studies, including SURMOUNT and SURPASS. We will present detailed results at an upcoming medical -- and submit to a peer-reviewed journal. We plan to submit results to the FDA and other regulatory agencies starting later this year. In other updates across our portfolio, Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of August 6. Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. I'll start with updates in cardiometabolic health, which is the new name of our internal business, formerly known as Lilly diabetes and obesity. In June, we published detailed results for our Phase 3 trials of tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity in the New England Journal of Medicine, and we presented results at the American Diabetes Association Meeting. All primary and key secondary endpoints were achieved in these studies. Notably, in one of our key secondary endpoints, as shown on Slide 17, tirzepatide demonstrated that up to 51.5% of participants met the criteria for disease resolution of sleep apnea. We've now submitted tirzepatide for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea and obesity to the FDA as well as the EMA. We are pleased that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation, and we expect U.S. regulatory action as early as the end of 2024, which will be dependent on the FDA granting priority review. Also, in June, we published results in the New England Journal from our Phase 2 trial of tirzepatide for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis, or MASH, with Stage 2 or Stage 3 fibrosis and we presented these results at the European Association for the Study of Donanemab. We are pleased to show that in a secondary endpoint, more than half of the patients taking tirzepatide achieved improvement in fibrosis at 52 weeks as shown on Slide 18. We're engaged with regulatory authorities on a potential Phase 3 registration strategy, and we're also encouraged by the potential read-through of these results to retatrutide, which also showed significant improvements in liver fats in Phase 2. This quarter, we also announced top-line data from two Phase 3 trials for our once weekly insulin called efsitora alfa, the QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 trials for the treatment of type 2 diabetes each met their primary endpoints of non-inferior A1c reduction. QWINT-2 compared to efsitora once-daily insulin degludec for 52 weeks in insulin naive adults. QWINT-4 compared efsitora to insulin glargine for 26 weeks in adult previously treated with daily basal insulin and at least two injections per day of meal time line. In both QWINT-2 and QWINT-4 efsitora, was safe and well tolerated. Detailed trial results will be presented in September at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting. We look forward to sharing additional data from the QWINT program later this year. We are pleased with our progress to provide breakthrough innovation to patients who require insulin, progressing our glucose-sensing insulin receptor agonist molecule in Phase 1 and investing in approaches aimed at disease modification for type 1 diabetes, such as -- cell therapy. In other late-phase updates, we've initiated Triumph outcomes, a Phase 3 trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes and renal function for patients taking retatrutide. Earlier in our cardiometabolic pipeline, you'll see additional incretin molecules in Phase 1. Incretins are an important part of our portfolio strategy and having multiple molecules in clinical development offers us potential optionality as we look at opportunities to help patients across mechanisms, indications, dosages, formulations and treatment schedules. To highlight a few. GLP-1 NPA2 is a small molecule non-peptide agonist of the GLP-1 receptor designed for once daily oral administration. We expect this asset to move to Phase 2 later this year, so we now identify it on our pipeline slide whereas it had previously been listed as not disclosed. Given the diversity of indications to potentially pursue with incretins, we are excited about the possibility of having another oral option to help more patients with different diseases. We also highlight today the GLP-1 coagonist III, which is a next-generation dual agonist molecule and we are planning to explore weekly and monthly dosing given its longer halfway. Elsewhere in our cardiometabolic health portfolio, we have stopped development of our NRG4 agonist as the profile was insufficient for further clinical development. Turning to oncology. We are pleased that Jaypirca has now been approved in Japan for people with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma who are resistant or intolerant to other BTK inhibitors. In early phase oncology, we've initiated the Phase 1 trial for a second Nectin-4 ADC. We view this as an important target and having two compounds in the clinic provides more opportunities to improve outcomes for patients. We've also initiated a Phase 1 trial for our ADC targeting the folate receptor. This asset, which came from our acquisition of Mablink is the next-generation construct design -- efficacy at all fully receptor expression levels and with an improved therapeutic index relative to existing agents. We're also announcing that we've terminated the LOXO-783 program, which targeted PI3 kinase alpha. We evaluated the ongoing clinical data from the program and compared the molecule to next-generation candidates that we have progressed from our discovery efforts. We believe our next molecules have greater potential to benefit patients and we look forward to putting our next candidate into the clinic in 2025 and sharing more about its profile later this year. In immunology, we've now submitted mirikizumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn's disease in Japan. We've terminated development for our GITR agonist, antagonists due to insufficient efficacy. We also announced our acquisition of Morphic. And pending completion of the deal we plan to reflect the oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin inhibitor, MORF-057, in Phase 2 for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Finally, in neuroscience, our anti-tau small molecule OGA inhibitor, recently concluded its Phase 2 study in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. OGA failed to meet the primary endpoint of decreasing the change of baseline as measured by -- in either of the two dose levels tested. We're reviewing the data for presentation of detailed results of the study at the clinical trials in Alzheimer's conference later this year. While this negative outcome is disappointing, we remain committed to TAP as a high conviction target in Alzheimer's disease and plan to continue studying Taobao. I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Yes, I'll start some R&D comments on BarCentry. The first, I think, is having a successful drug in Phase 3 clinical trials and getting it approved. You can see that we've invested thoroughly, I would say, in our Phase 3 portfolio is often pursuing multiple indications in multiple populations at once. Just being able to get to that point, I know investors have gotten excited about various releases of Phase 1 data. But it's still a challenging space to develop drugs and we usually wait until we've seen pretty robust Phase 2 data before we get too excited about a particular molecule. So that's the first thing. And I think a lot of the news we've seen from different companies only sort out as we get to see Phase 2 data and which molecules make it and which have the right profile and which don't. But I wouldn't be expecting 100% success here. Yes. Thanks for raising this important topic, Tim. Of course, we've been watching this carefully, not really out of concern that they're taking away our business. We've been largely supply constraint here, but rather the impact it's having on patient health. We often are able to secure samples from these kinds of compounding labs and analyze them in our own labs. And what we found for the most part, in most instances is this isn't kind of tirzepatide at all. Our drug is not available to compounders, rather they're purchasing either other chemicals entirely, which we often find or make producers of tirzepatide that is often full of impurities sometimes contaminated by bacteria. This is a safety risk to patients that we take seriously and try to think we can to make patients aware of the potential dangers here so that we can help. Yes. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about the opportunity to help patients suffering from NASH. I think the data that we shared in Phase 2 for tirzepatide appetite is really quite profound in terms of the size of effect we can have. There's a couple of issues in mass drug development that we're trying to tackle, probably the most significant of which is current standard of liver biopsy to identify the patients to enroll in these trials and also then measure the outcome. Liver biopsy is obviously an invasive procedure and difficult to find patients to consent to these trials and of course, there's risk to patients. We're working hard to develop noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify the right patients to enroll in mass studies and also potentially could be used as an outcome to know if a drug is working. My hope is that we could develop those kinds of biomarkers that could be used both purposes and could be suitable for accelerated or approval of mass drugs in the future. Of course, long-term traditional approval for Astra still requires demonstration of outcomes. So, in that environment, we have two drugs that I think could both be great mass drugs and we'll have to decide whether to invest in one or both of those drugs, depending on the regulatory path we see. We'll keep investors updated as we make decisions about these molecules in mesh. Yes. Thanks. I'll start, and then we'll see Patrik to anything to add on commercial differentiation. But in the clinical trials, I think first of all, as I'm saying before, just take some caution on the small short Phase I trials. There's more to see. Most of the drugs that we've seen actually aren't different mechanisms that are GLP-1 agonists. In this class, I don't expect there to be differentiation in terms of efficacy, weight loss. You can pretty much dial in the amount of weight loss you want depending on how aggressively you dose it and what population. Tolerability is another issue that usually comes along with the efficacy. The faster you ramp to higher doses, the less tolerability you have. Then the different companies have to work through their own escalation of dosing to match the desired efficacy with some reasonable tolerability. The variable that links those two things together is often the half-life of the molecule. So shorter half-life molecules will give you bigger peak trough -- in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. And we think that's what -- that drives the tolerability issues. So, what you want is a long half-life molecule that can be dose escalated more smoothly. So that probably will be the differentiation rather than anything that companies are currently talking about in terms of efficacy. As I said before, it's a long road from early data to Phase 3 clinical trials like we have with orforglipron and we can expect some attrition. I'm pretty excited also about next-generation molecule. All of these ones that we've been talking about now are GLP-1s and will offer efficacy sort of in the range of injectable semaglutide. I think ultimately, we'd like to see drugs that offer efficacy and tolerability that exceeds that things that could combine multiple incretins like tirzepatide does and we are certainly working on orals that could also agonize GIP-1, for example. So exciting progress there and more to come on that in the future for us. So, we have multiple mechanisms in play here, starting maybe with the amylin. We have a molecule Phase 2 called Aloralintide, which is a pure AML agonist, and we're evaluating that both as monotherapy and in combination with tirzepatide GLP clip. So that will be interesting to see. I don't have a strong preconceived notions about what to expect in terms of lean versus fat mass loss with that particular combination. Probably the people who have the most data about that would be the scientists at Novo since they've investigated cricalutide in combination with semaglutide. I think that brings us probably to another mechanism, which is dual amylin calcitonin agonism, which crugilatide probably is a dual agonist, and we have a molecule like that in Phase 1 called DACRA and we'll also investigate that and composition of biomass will be one of the aspects in which we evaluate it. And then finally, you talk of myostatin, we have a molecule in this family, and that's the bimagrumab that we acquired from Versatis, which is an antibiotic -- and that's proceeding in a Phase 2 trial in combination with semaglutide. And we look forward to having data to share with that in the future. All of these mechanisms, I think, could have variable effects on body mass composition. I point out that so far, we've not seen any disadvantages to the types of weight loss that we get with tirzepatide. In fact, patients show improved functional outcomes on a variety of things, including fruit function and heart failures we just demonstrated. So, could we have further improvements with even more higher ratio of fat to lean mass? That's the question of these trials makes Yes. No, thanks for the question, Lisa. I think it's an interesting area of science for sure. Too soon to know exactly how these kinds of mechanisms will translate into benefits for patients. At a high level, we know that the ratio of lean mass to fat mass is really important in determining metabolic health, probably more important as an indicator of overall metabolic health than, for example, BMI. And so that's what spurs these kinds of efforts to increase lean mass while causing fat mass loss and we'll wait to see data from our own donanemab and wait to see how that translates into health benefits for patients."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave. So, I'm on Slide 7, which summarizes the financial performance in the second quarter of 2024. Second quarter revenue growth of 36% was primarily driven by Mounjaro and Zepbound as well as Verzenio. When excluding revenue from the sale of rights to Baqsimi in Q2 of last year, revenue grew 46%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 79.8% in Q2 of '23 to 82% in Q2 of '24. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from favorable product -- and higher realized prices, partially offset by higher production costs. R&D expenses increased 15% driven by continued investment in our portfolio and in our people. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by promotional efforts associated ongoing and future launches as well as investments in our people. Operating income increased 90% in Q2, driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. The effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 16.5% in Q2 of '24 compared with 16.1% in Q2 of '23. The Q2 '24 tax rate reflects a mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions, while the Q2 '23 rate reflected the impact of earnings from the sale of rights for Baqsimi. At the bottom line, we delivered earnings per share of $3.92 in Q2, an 86% increase compared to the prior year. Q2 '24 results include a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR&D charges compared to $0.09 in the prior quarter, Q2 of '23. On Slide 9, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 42% in Q2. Volume growth of 27% was driven by Zepbound, Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by sale of rights for Baqsimi in Q2 of '23 and declines in Trulicity. Realized prices increased 15%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics. As noted in our Q4 -- Q1 2024 earnings call, unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler back orders at the end of Q1. In Q2, we fulfilled the majority of these back orders, improving wholesaler stocking levels. We estimate that U.S. Mounjaro and Zepbound aggregate sales in the second quarter were positively impacted by channel stocking that we estimate totaled high teens to mid-20s as a percent of U.S. sales as we rebuilt inventory from extremely low levels in the spring and to account for the growth of these brands. We are pleased that the group's supply situation is reflected on the FDA shortage website, which currently shows all doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound, listed as available and the two lower doses of Trulicity as available. While wholesaler back orders in the U.S. have been reduced substantially, it's important to note that the pharmaceutical supply chain is complex, more so for medicines that require refrigeration and offer at several different doses. These factors may continue to result in variability in the patient experience at the pharmacy counter. While supply and demand has come into better balance, we expect increase in demand may result in periodic supply tightness for certain presentations and dose levels. We have a continued broad agenda to further increase supply, and we'll continue to look at all options. Today, we are excited to announce plans to further expand access to Zepbound with the launch of the 2.5-milligram and 5-milligram single-dose files in the coming weeks with more details to come at that time. In Europe, revenue grew 20% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro launch uptake in the U.K. and Germany. We also had strong volume growth from Verzenio, Jardiance, which was partially offset by decreased volume from Trulicity. Japan performance was strong in the second quarter with 15% revenue growth in constant currency. Volume growth of 21% was driven by uptake of Mounjaro and Verzenio. Moving to China. Q2 revenue increased 1% in constant currency. Growth was driven by -- Olumiant and Taltz, partially offset by Trulicity and Cialis. Mounjaro was recently approved in China for type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management. We have not yet announced expected launch timing in this market. Revenue in Rest of World increased 61% in constant currency, primarily driven by Mounjaro volume growth from demand and channel dynamics. Slide 10 provides additional perspective on performance across our product categories. Verzenio solid growth in the second quarter across major geographies with worldwide sales increasing 44%, driven by the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $92 million worldwide, which included a $19 million partner milestone payment related to Japan. Jaypirca continued impressive quarter-over-quarter growth, building on the brand's uptake from both the MCL and CLL patient populations. OMVOH is launched in the U.S. and 14 international markets with sales of $26 million in Q2. These launches continue to progress well with increasing patient starts. And in the U.S., we expect sales to accelerate as the product-specific code went live on July 1. Mounjaro sales in Q2 were $3.1 billion globally with $2.4 billion in the U.S. Revenue growth in the U.S. reflected continued strong demand as well as the improved channel dynamics discussed earlier. We're seeing solid uptake in Mounjaro outside the U.S., with sales in Q2 totaling $677 million. In the first half of the year, we launched the quick pen presentation in the U.K., Germany and the UAE. So far in Q3, we've also launched Mounjaro Quick Pen in Spain and plan to launch an additional market throughout 2024. In Q2, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 31%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 36% driven by lower volume, primarily due to competitive dynamics and supply constraints, partially offset by improved wholesaler stocking levels on services. Turning to Slide 11. We have an update on the U.S. launch of Zepbound. We've seen exceptional growth trends for Zepbound that have accelerated as production has ramped leading to sales of over $1.2 billion in Q2. We are rapidly building our formulary coverage for Zepbound in the U.S. and as of July 1 had approximately 86% access in the commercial segment. We estimate over 50% of employers have opted into anti-obesity medicine coverage and see that modestly growing as we work to expand coverage. On Slide 12, we provide an update on our capital allocation. Slide 13 shows our updated 2024 financial guidance. We are raising our full year revenue outlook by $3 billion to be between $45.4 million and $46.6 billion. This increase is due to strong performance across our non-incretin medicines as well as Mounjaro and Zepbound. Additionally, we have improved clarity into the timing and pace of our production expansion and Mounjaro launches outside the U.S. We achieved a number of supply-related milestones in Q2 and have increased confidence regarding our expectation that production of salable doses of incretin medicines in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5 times the salable doses taken half of 2023. Based on the midpoint of the range, our updated guidance implies revenue growth of 38% in the second half of the year, below 31% in the first half. In the second half of the year, we expect a more significant growth in Q4 compared to Q3. Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 36% to 38% on a reported basis and 37% to 39% on a non-GAAP basis. For other income and expense, we now expect between $525 million and $425 million of expense on a reported basis, and between $400 million and $300 million of expense on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges reflect lower expected net interest expense and the reported range reflects net losses on investments in equity securities through Q2 of '24. We have increased our estimated effective tax rate to be approximately 15%, driven by changes in our forecasted mix of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $15.10 to $15.60 on a reported basis $16.10 to $16.60 on a non-GAAP basis. Both ranges -- the updates mentioned earlier as well as acquired IPR&D charges through Q2 of $0.24. The reported range includes a charge in Q2 of '24 associated with anticipated litigation payments. Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R&D. Sure. I'll hang -- with that. Seamus, thanks for the question. Yes. So just on price streams, initial favorability in the first half of the year was driven by Mounjaro. That goes away in the second half of the year as the co-pay program moves out of the base period. In terms of pricing, we see stable pricing sequentially across quarters in '24. So, nothing unusual, Q1 to Q2 and our guidance Q3 and Q4 continue stable sequential pricing. For the second half of the year when you don't have the Mounjaro dynamic pricing in the second half will be similar to prior year pricing. So those are kind of the dynamics we see in pricing. Good. Thanks. Appreciate the question. Yes, I mean, we've been speaking for a long time about operating margins and getting to the mid- to high 30% range. As we've seen this year, Mounjaro and Zepbound are taking an inflection point upwards and so we're seeing ourselves at the top end of that range. For the first half, margins are a little inflated. We haven't yet lend in to all of our promotional channels and incretins. You don't see, for instance, TV commercials in the incretins. We haven't done that looking at the -- given the supply situation. And in R&D, it takes time to scale R&D thoughtfully. So, it doesn't always move exactly in sync quarter-by-quarter with revenue. That said, our guidance for the year does indicate we will stay in the upper 30% range for the full year, with growth first half, if you look at the first half, as the two quarters' growth into the second half. And you should also expect to see within that mix, stronger sales and marketing growth as we get to new launches in the second part of the year and the R&D continue to scale the growth from what we've seen thus far. So those are the dynamics we see on operating margin for 2024. Will do. Thanks, Kerry. I appreciate the question. Yes. I think as we said, like dance, as I said earlier, we do expect to end in that upper 30s range this year. There's still a lot at play here. Yes, on the top line, we see inflection points on revenue. But through the first half, you've had an inflated position. We haven't yet leaned in to any of our promotional channels. That's going to be a dynamic that we lean to more starting in the second half. And R&D, we do intend to scale that, and that's not going quarter-by-quarter exactly in line with revenue. So, all of those things are still going to play through. I think that said, at this point, we're just talking about 2024. And when we do guidance for '25, we'll chat about the longer-term picture there."

            "name": "Patrik Jonsson",
            "content": "A few additional comments. I think when we look at the marketplace, about two are very important barriers. We have been extremely successful in gaining access across both Mounjaro, where we are currently 93% access in commercial and 89% in Part D. And similarly, for Zepbound, 86% after 7 months in the marketplace, that's quite significant. The second piece is the amount of outcome indications. We are investing heavily in both Mounjaro and Zepbound, and similarly for the Phase 3 assets of our Zepbound and retatrutide. So, I think, overall, we think that we are extremely well positioned to compete here. And we are not surprised to see that most of the firms are actually leaning into this very important space. But with the cost we have not had in the market today, the Phase 3 assets and what we referred in the prepared remarks, we are well positioned to compete today and tomorrow. And that -- both different indications, assets Gene [ph] therapy, et cetera, all hands-on deck on our side. Absolutely. I think first overall, when we look at persistency, it's very early after the launch. But based on the feedback we have from providers, and from patients as well, this is a drug that patients want to stay on because they experience the benefits -- weight loss and also the downstream implications on comorbidities. You're right, the employee opt-in efforts are extremely key, and we believe that our outcome data, OSA, now have -- will help us tremendously and more readout to come over the coming years. We're also having value-based agreement with several other payers where we are looking into the benefits of tirzepatide in the workplace in terms of reduced absentees, increased productivity, et cetera, as well and that has gained a lot of interest. In terms of the consumer, yes, the ease to start and stay on is a key priority for us. And then we're working with consumer, improving our consumer platforms and also digital channels to really enable patients to experience the benefits that Zepbound provides over time. Just from a commercial point of view, we are regularly conducting both consumer and provider market research. And when we're looking into the preferences, the true drivers today is still the degree of weight loss and safety and tolerability. And when we look at the needs beyond that, it's actually the need of an oral, and an oral with an injectable-like efficacy. So that's probably the new that comes beyond what we're currently serving today and particularly to serve those patients that have a fear of injections. When we look at over aspects, I think what comes beyond that would be the compensation of weight loss, lean mass versus fats and durability. And I think we are looking into all of those aspects as well."

            "name": "Ilya Yuffa",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Mohit, for the question. We've seen some great progress with the launch of Mounjaro outside of the U.S. I think what you've seen in terms of growth in the earlier launch countries, such as the U.K., UAE and Saudi, UAE and Saudi are both key markets that make up rest of world, have already achieved a leading share and continue to drive momentum and overall market growth. And so, as you take a look at Q2, the main driver of that growth has been in Mounjaro in markets where we've already launched earlier in the cycle and majority of that coming from the Quick Pen presentation with a lot of that in the UAE. Some of that is channel dynamics similar to the U.S. At the same time, if you take a look at Q2 and the trajectory for Q2 relative to historical peak sales of any of our brand, has already surpassed that with a limited number of markets where we've launched. And so, as we look at the coming quarters, obviously, we just recently launched in Germany and now also Spain with Quick Pen presentation. We'll also look and monitor the demand and also supply capacity and expect to launch in new markets. The near-term growth, I would expect predominantly coming from already launched markets of Mounjaro. Sure. Well, of course, I think the momentum overall is progressing quite nicely in both the reimbursed as well as the out-of-pocket segments. We have achieved reimbursement in the U.K. We have reimbursement in Germany, and we're continuing to look for reimbursement and expand reimbursement in other markets that we've launched. We have some reimbursement in UAE in Saudi as well in type 2 diabetes. And we continue to expand on that in the markets that we will enter. But a lot of that momentum is covering both the Type 2 and chronically management market and both in the reimbursed and out-of-pocket segment, and we're seeing both the progress in share as well as market expansion in the markets that we've been in."

[Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Eli Lilly and Company's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Joe Fletcher, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me on today's call are Dave Ricks, Lilly's Chair and CEO; Anat Ashkenazi, Chief Financial Officer; Dr. Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology; Anne White, President of Lilly Neuroscience; Ilya Yuffa, President of Lilly International; Jake Van Naarden, President of Loxo at Lilly; and Patrik Jonsson, President of Lilly Diabetes and Obesity and Lilly U.S.A. We're also joined by Michaela Irons, Mike Springnether and Lauren Zierki of the IR team.  \n During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on Slide 2. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC.  \n The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It's not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note, our commentary will focus on our non-GAAP financial measures.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. \nDavid Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Joe. We're pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum in our business, which positions us well for accelerated growth as this year progresses. Our focus is to bring innovative medicines to people in need. And in 2024, we're investing in our people, our launches, expanding our pipeline of new medicines, including through business development, and of course, accelerating the needed capacity in our manufacturing network. Results this quarter represent a continuation of the strong growth we delivered in 2023.  \n On Slide 4, you can see details of the financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 26% in Q1 with our new products growing nearly $1.8 billion compared with the same period last year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the U.S. and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the U.S. for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and the initiation of our Phase III study for lepodisiran, evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany. And in existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand.  \n The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery life for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets. While we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States.  \n We continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter.  \n On Slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates.  \n So now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results. \nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improved production costs.  \n Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches as well as increased compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as a onetime charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio prostate program.  \n In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10. Operating income increased 63% in Q1 driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9% compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023 driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods.  \n On Slide 7, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 28% in Q1 driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the U.S. increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics.  \n Moving to Europe. Revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro as well as payments associated with the distribution and divestiture agreements.  \n Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity and a partnership milestone in the base period.  Price declined 5% in the quarter.  \n Moving to China. Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant and Cialis.  \n Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, Verzenio and Jardiance.  \n Slide 8 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increased 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase III trials read out.  \n Next in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally, and $1.5 billion in the U.S., up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the U.S. was impacted by a onetime benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023 as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 and a strong demand. Access level across commercial and Part D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines.  \n The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. And each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties yet in their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year, the production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5x the saleable doses in the second half of 2023.  In the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship.  \n Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks.  \n In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30% driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to health care professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity.  \n Turning to Slide 9. We have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound with over $0.5 billion in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S. And as of April 1, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access to this market is a two-step process typically require individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access, both with PBMs and for employer opt-ins and early progress is encouraging.  \n On Slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation.  \n Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance. Given the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom end of the range to be between $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024.  With this update, year-over-year revenue growth of the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures.\n Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32% to 34% on a reported basis and 33% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense and tax rate, which now takes into consideration Q1 results.  \n Based on these updates, and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.05 to $13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50 to $14 on a non-GAAP basis.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D. \nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month. That was the positive Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesities and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and even type 2 diabetes.  \n The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S. with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70% of people with OSA also live with obesity.  While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease.  \n As shown on Slide 12, SURMOUNT-OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study 1 evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy, while Study 2 evaluates tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least 3 months prior to the study and plans to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. A total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which can be 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or to placebo. And patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks.  \n On Slide 13, we show the results of Study 1. For the efficacy estimate on mean Apnea-Hypopnea Index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9 and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body rate reduction of 18.1% for tirzepatide treatment consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo.  \n On Slide 14, we show the results of Study 2. In this population, for the efficacy [ estimand ], tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1% in the tirzepatide arm and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%. Again, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body rate reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant.  \n In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and constipation. \n Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see given several factors that were uniquely combined in the study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there's a particularly high baseline BMI in this population. And finally, the use of the 10- or 15-milligram maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20% despite this difficult-to-treat population.  \n Consistent with other Phase III studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT-OSA during a symposium at ADA on June 21. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear.  \n Moving to the other updates across our portfolio. Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 26, and Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in QWINT-4, the first Phase III study of insulin efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin. This study evaluated efsitora compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT\tT-2 which is evaluating efsitora compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin.  \n Together, these are the first 2 of 5 studies in the efsitora Phase III program.  \n Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study, showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time-to-first hospitalization due to heart failure or all-cause mortality versus placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. \n We've completed enrollment for SURMOUNT-MMO with over 15,000 participants, and for both orforglipron studies in chronic weight management, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, which together enrolled 4,500 participants.  \n Finally, we've now initiated the [ TRANSCEND ] Phase III program studying retatrutide in type 2 diabetes.  \n In the cardiovascular disease area, we're excited to have initiated the Phase III trial for lepodisiran, the subcutaneous injectable siRNA. This study will evaluate the efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes for participants with high lipoprotein A, who have cardiovascular disease or at a risk of heart attack or stroke. We are evaluating the efficacy of lepodisiran in both secondary and high-risk primary prevention. And we hope this will one day offer health care providers a treatment option for a broad group of patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high LP(a) levels.  \n Earlier in our diabetes and obesity pipeline, we've now initiated a Phase II monotherapy study evaluating eloralintide, our selective amylin receptor agonist in obesity.  \n Turning to oncology. We made the decision to terminate for futility, the Phase III CYCLONE 3 trial evaluating Verzenio in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer following an interim analysis. This concludes development of Verzenio in prostate cancer following last quarter's announcement that the CYCLONE 2 study did not meet its primary endpoint. \n In early oncology development, we've initiated Phase I trials for two new assets. The first is our Nectin-4 ADC, which came from our acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics. The second is PNT2001, which came from our acquisition of POINT Biopharma. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our oncology portfolio and expect 2024 to be particularly productive. Along with the Nectin-4 ADC and PNT2001 start, we expect at least three other new molecules to enter the clinic this year. We look forward to sharing more details with the investment community at an oncology-focused investor event hosted by the Lilly Oncology team. This event will take place on the evening of Sunday, June 2 in Chicago in conjunction with the ASCO annual meeting and will also be available via webcast. We plan to provide an update on our oncology strategy and pipeline opportunities. Additional details will be available soon regarding this event.  \n Turning to Neuroscience. Last month, we announced that the FDA plans to convene a meeting of the peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We expect the advisory committee meeting will take place in mid-2024, but the exact date will be confirmed when it appears in the Federal Register. We expect the focus to be around the safety and efficacy profile of donanemab, along with unique aspects of the clinical program. We remain confident in donanemab's potential to offer very meaningful benefits to patients and look forward to addressing the FDA's questions in this form.  \n Additionally, we made the decision to discontinue investigation of GBA1, our gene therapy assets in Gaucher disease type 2. Phase II studies in Parkinson's disease and Gaucher disease type 1 are still underway and have not been impacted by this decision.  \n Finally, in immunology, we've submitted mirikizumab to the FDA and EMA for approval for use in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In the U.S., we've resubmitted lebrikizumab's application to the FDA for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This is following a complete response letter based on inspection findings of the third-party manufacturer. As a reminder, the letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package safety or label. We expect regulatory action in the second half of this year.  \n We're also announcing that in the coming months, we'll be initiating Phase III studies evaluating lebrikizumab in two new indications: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and allergic rhinitis due to perennial allergens. Lebrikizumab will be the first biologic to be evaluated in Phase III for allergic rhinitis. We're optimistic about the potential of lebrikizumab to be an important treatment option in these patient populations as well as in atopic dermatitis. In earlier-stage immunology development, we've advanced our CD19 antibody into Phase II for multiple sclerosis.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. \nDavid Ricks: Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress in our first quarter. Strong revenue growth in Q1 was driven by our recent product launches, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. We expect acceleration in revenue growth through the second half of the year as supply of incretin medicines continues to ramp. Significant advances in our pipeline include top line data from tirzepatide and SURMOUNT-OSA, approval of the KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro in the EU, submission of mirikizumab and lebrikizumab as well as initiation of lepodisiran  Phase III study, as Dan just mentioned. We are continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, internal and external pipeline development and our manufacturing expansion agenda. This is to sustain our long-term growth outlook.\n So now let me turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. We'd like to take questions from as many callers as possible and to conclude our call in a timely manner. [Operator Instructions] \n Paul, please provide instructions for the Q&A session, and we're ready for our first caller. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan. \nChristopher Schott: Congrats on the progress here. I just had a question, just was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on the capacity dynamics that are leading to the guidance raise today. Specifically just looking for little more color, is this more U.S. or international? And should we read this as more capacity in the system than you expected or just a faster ramp of the new plant and maybe the same overall capacity as you exit the year? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. I'll hand over to Anat to talk about the guidance raise. \nAnat Ashkenazi: Thanks for the question, Chris. And as we've mentioned earlier in the year when we issued guidance, we said that we expect capacity and supply to ramp towards the second half of the year, and that's what we're seeing. \n Now as a reminder, we do have quite a large number of nodes across our supply chain that have to come online or ramp capacity. We are -- if you look at everything we have under construction, or ramping up, we have six sites right now between the two sites in North Carolina, a site in Ireland, two sites in Indiana, a site in Germany and then a seventh one that we just purchased, they are all either ramping up or under construction. \n And there are multiple nodes across that supply chain that have to become operational, which requires approval, et cetera, for three products, depending on which product runs on which line, that are planned throughout the year. \n Now that we're 4 months into the year, we have greater visibility into that -- into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident. Just as one example, the approval of the KwikPen in Europe that just came in slightly ahead of our expectation gives us additional confidence in our ability to launch KwikPen for patients in Europe. \n So it is across our sites globally as well as ramping up capacity with partners or CDMOs as well as in existing sites where we're making investments to expand where we can or ramp up capacity. So it's across our supply chain. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. \nMohit Bansal: I have a question regarding the pricing. So if you look at the script trend, it seems like there was a little bit of adverse relationship in the pricing versus fourth quarter. Can you comment on that? And how should we think about the cadence of price volume over the quarters for the year? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Mohit. You didn't say it, but I assume you're talking about Mounjaro and Zepbound so I'll hand over to Patrik to make some commentary on net price. \nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Mohit. When you look at the pricing of Mounjaro, I think it's important to take into account that in the Q4 earnings, we announced a onetime adjustment for Mounjaro in Q4 that was quite significant. So it was a onetime adjustment in the base of Q4. \n When we look forward for the first half of 2024, it's important to have in mind that we also terminated the $25 saving card 6/30/2023, but patients that were on are grandfathered until 6/30/2024. So there would probably be some benefits during the first half of 2024 for Mounjaro. But from the second half of this year, we should expect to see typical pricing headwinds for Mounjaro as well. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Umer Raffat from Evercore. \nUmer Raffat: I wanted to focus a quick second on Part D reimbursement dynamics, if I may. And my question is, will tirzepatide be considered differently than a \"weight loss drug\" to secure Part D reimbursement? And the new indications like sleep apnea, will they considered an applicable drug and not get lumped up as a broad \"weight loss drug\"? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Umer. I'll go to Patrik for that question. \nPatrik Jonsson: Thank you very much, Umer. I think with the announcement made by the CMS early April to reimburse comorbidities for obesity based upon the SELECT trial, we're also confident that with the new data that we presented just weeks ago in terms of obstructive sleep apnea, that's going to be reimbursed in Medicare Part D. And we expect similarly for other comorbidities and the readout of HFpEF, assuming that's positive and approved, and later on with the mobility-mortality outcome study. \n Still, our true north is really to get the true Treat and Reduce Obesity Act cost, and we strongly believe it's not a matter of if but when. We don't see it likely to pass in 2024, but there is still a small likelihood that that's going to happen. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. \nSeamus Fernandez: Great. So really just wanted to ask, Dan, as you have assessed the Phase II SURMOUNT data in NASH, just interested to know how you are thinking about those data and the opportunity for tirzepatide in that setting or perhaps if retatrutide remains the right target molecule to move forward there? We've had a lot of speculation around some of the comments from the last quarter and just trying to firm that up and also when we're likely to see those data, I believe, they're expected at EASL, but if that is possible to confirm. \nJoe Fletcher: Dan? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Thanks, Seamus. So I'll start with the last part there. Yes, the abstract was accepted and will be presented at EASL early June. So that will be the opportunity to see the full NASH package from that Phase II trial. \n Like we said in the last call, really exciting data. We shared some of the top line. I think tirzepatide can have a profound effect on this disease. It's a Phase II trial. Next steps here are to discuss with the FDA what the best path forward could be for tirzepatide. \n You're pointing out, though, that we have another choice in retatrutide which, based on biomarker data from earlier studies, could also have a profound effect of this disease. That molecule has the addition of glucagon, which is likely to have additional benefits in the liver. So important opportunities ahead and good-to-have options as we go into these discussions with regulators. \n I think for MASH, like other obesity-related or metabolic related diseases, Lilly has a pretty broad portfolio, and we'll just continue to push the science to make the best possible medicines for patients. \nOperator: The next question will be from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research. \nTimothy Anderson: You showed a slide, Zepbound has NBRx share market of 57% end of Q1. That makes it pretty clear that the strongest drug wins. So on that topic, just your latest thinking on upcoming competitor readouts and how they'll stack up to Zepbound on metrics of weight loss and blood sugar. So specifically, CagriSema from Novo and Amgen's 133. I know it's just the best guess, but it's what we get asked to do. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Tim. Okay. I'll maybe hand to Dan for some comments. \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, sure, Tim. It's probably more of your job than ours to speculate on competitor readouts but I'll take a stab at it since you asked. I think on AMG 133, we've just seen really a small amount of data. So probably anything is possible and like you will be interested to see their results. Of course, there's arguments that can be heard about GIP agonism versus antagonism. We've placed our bets, and we like the data we got with GIP agonism. \n On CagriSema, of course, adding more agonism on different pathways on top of GLP-1 is a good idea. That's what we have with tirzepatide, is a dual agonist. So CagriSema makes sense. And you'll note that we've advanced our amylin agonist to Phase II. \n Tirzepatide already is a dual agonist. Retatrutide is already a triple agonist. There's probably more we could do here at Lilly. I think across our portfolio, in Phase I and Phase II, we have nine assets that are marked for diabetes or obesity. Many of them could lead to additive weight loss on top of established mechanisms plus two more in Phase III, of course. So we have a strong portfolio here. I think tirzepatide still has unsurpassed efficacy at weight loss, but we're preparing for our next generation assets as well. \nOperator: The next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. \nTerence Flynn: Congrats on all the progress. Just was wondering if you can tell us if the IQVIA prescription data is an accurate representation of tirzepatide volumes or if it's been underrepresented at all given LillyDirect and what you know about how much is flowing through that channel? And if it is underrepresented, can you help quantify any delta for us. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks for the question, Terence. I'll hand to Patrik for commentary on IQVIA and LillyDirect. \nPatrik Jonsson: Thanks very much, Terence. When it comes to LillyDirect, I think we are very pleased with the start. And when we look at the utilization by consumers, it's gaining traction by weeks here. \n If we look at the TRx data of Q1, particularly for Zepbound, it's relatively low volume that goes through LillyDirect, slightly higher in terms of NBRx. It's our understanding that what goes through LillyDirect is not by default captured by IQVIA. But IQVIA has a methodology in place to estimate what goes through LillyDirect as well. \nOperator: The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. \nAkash Tewari: So your team presented data on a monotherapy GIP agonist at ADA last year, but it looks like you are moving the amylin into Phase II. Can you talk about why amylin might be preferred versus GIP as a maintenance regimen for obesity? And how your product could defer versus others when it comes to half-life and preferential agonism versus calcitonin and amylin? \nJoe Fletcher: Thank you, Akash. I'll hand to Dan for a commentary on our amylin. \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes, there are a lot of good questions in there. Thanks for following so closely. So on the GIP, the long-acting molecule, I think primarily in that experiment, we were excited to show the benefits of isolated GIP agonism, just to answer some mechanism of action questions around tirzepatide. But as you point out, there's potential for that molecule for other indications or as a monotherapy or combination with other mechanisms. \n But of course, since tirzepatide already includes GIP agonism, we're also excited to explore other mechanisms. So that's where [ elora ], which is 1 of 9 different mechanisms, as I said a moment ago that we're exploring the long-acting amylin moved forward to Phase II. That has potential perhaps as a combination therapy, perhaps as a maintenance therapy, perhaps as a monotherapy, there's a lot to explore. It's still very early as it is for all of our mechanisms. So we'll keep investing and as we have data to share, we'll do that. \nOperator: The next question will be from Trung Huynh from UBS. \nTrung Huynh: Just back on CMS recently broadening its coverage for Wegovy for certain heart conditions. I appreciate you mentioned that TROA is the main goal. But do you expect Zepbound to get added to CMS in a similar way as Wegovy? And when could this happen? Could this be after the heart failure data in 3Q? Or do we have to wait for the CVOT data? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Trung. I'll let Patrik respond. \nPatrik Jonsson: Thanks, Trung. Now based upon what CMS stated early April, we actually expect to get obstructive sleep apnea for Zepbound covered by CMS and Medicare at the time of launch. And the next one then would be HFpEF assuming a positive readout and approval. And the third one would be the MMO indication. That's the sequence of our plans, assuming everything goes according to plan and we get the approval for both. \nOperator: The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America. \nGeoffrey Meacham: You guys have been asked on this before, I'm sure, but can you just review the rationale in utilizing the KwikPen just for outside the U.S. markets like Europe. I wasn't sure why this couldn't apply to the U.S. market and if this also could be a means to relieve capacity looking forward? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Geoff, for the question. Paul -- Dave, you want to weigh in? . \nDavid Ricks: Yes. Sure. And Ilya can add to this. As we think we've said on several calls now, our goal is to pursue all of the above, basically as it relates to supply options, recognizing the tremendous demand and unmet need and the constraints that exist in scaling the supply chain. So KwikPen uses existing assets, so there was less time lag. We see this first in the U.K. and now in Europe as a way to meet the needs of those patients. But we haven't ruled it out in other jurisdictions. And so we'll continue to look at every option we can to meet the needs of patients with obesity and overweight as well as with diabetes. \nOperator: The next question is from Kerry Holford from Berenberg. \nKerry Holford: I'm going to take a different topic here. Looking LP(a), your new product you've now said that you're taking into Phase III. Can you confirm whether you've published new Phase II data, haven't found any. So if I'm correct, when  might we see that published? And can you confirm what dose and frequency of administration you're looking at from that Phase III study? And I guess that you appear to be positioned third in that race, would be interested to hear how you expect your drug to be differentiated versus the competitor as that's already in Phase III. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kerry. So a good multipart question, but on Lp(a), happy to talk about lepodisiran. So Dan, do you want to comment on this? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Kerry, for the good questions here. You're right, we haven't yet published a Phase II data. But I think we just recently were able to publish the Phase I data. That was really exciting and well received. I think one of the things that people noted in our Phase I data was a very long durability of action and a very deep reduction in Lp(a) levels following a single dose of lepodisiran. We now have, of course, a Phase II data in hand and use that to design and begin the Phase III trial. \n I think we haven't quite disclosed dose or frequency yet, but I'm sure that will happen in time. You asked about differentiation. I think there's probably a couple of different potentials for differentiation here versus a shorter-acting ASO and a siRNA that are both in Phase III studies. Maybe first is the depth of clearance of Lp(a), we don't know how much you have to reduce Lp(a) to lead to benefits in cardiovascular outcomes and whether there's a threshold effect or a floor to this. So the depth of clearance is one. \n The second, as you asked about, could be frequency of administration or durability of action, those two being closely linked. And the third, of course, is the population that's being studied into -- I noted we're studying secondary as well as primary prevention here. So I think we have a good package with multiple opportunities for differentiation and eager to test the Lp(a) hypothesis here this Phase III study. \nOperator: The next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. \nSteve Scala: Given that based on all available metrics, the SURPASS-CVOT interim likely already has passed, can you confirm that the only way the trial would have stopped is if there were either a survival benefit or futility and not simply non-inferiority? And anything you can say regarding your confidence in eventually hitting superiority based on what you know so far? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Steve. Dan, do you want to take the question on SURPASS-CVOT? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Sure. Thanks, Steve. As you know, we do our best not to comment on interim analyses, although many of our different trials can incorporate interim analyses. But when we do talk about the risks, unintentional unblinding of results, for that reason, we prefer not to do that. \n You're right that the primary analysis of the study and the design is around noninferiority versus what we are ready to know to be a very good drug that reduces cardiovascular risk, and that's Trulicity. So it's designed as a noninferiority trial. Of course, when the final data come, we would be delighted to see even superiority. \n You asked about our confidence. Confidence continues to increase for this readout. In fact, as disclosed in the prepared remarks today, we got additional data here even from the OSA study that should make us feel more confident, not just the benefit in sleep apnea, which itself could lead to cardiovascular benefits, but actually the weight loss. And I think there are some concerns about weight loss of different populations and different trials and males, females, et cetera. So some of that was discharged here. So we remain excited and look forward to getting that data when the study's complete. \nOperator: The next question will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. \nEvan Seigerman: I wanted to touch on donanemab with the AdCom approaching. Can you discuss how your -- if your confidence has changed in the asset? And maybe any specific points that you hope will be addressed during this discussion with these outside experts. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Evan. Anne, you want to discuss [ donanemab ] and AdCom? \nAnne White: Yes. Thanks so much for the question. And we are incredibly confident in donanemab's potential and the fact that it offers very meaningful benefits to people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and just the overall approvability of the package. We do look forward to seeing there's questions. We haven't received those yet. I think that what we'll anticipate really is discussions around the safety and efficacy of donanemab. And those -- the safety and efficacy profile remain very consistent with what we published and presented. So nothing new there. \n We do expect there's a couple of unique aspects to our trial that we anticipate they'll want to discuss. One is around limited duration dosing. We think this is an incredibly important feature of donanemab, the chance to stop dosing when you've cleared the plaques. And donanemab clears them robustly and rapidly so we think that allows for this limited duration dosing approach. So we really do look forward to getting into that data and having the advisers see that and respond to it. \n Another unique aspect is assessing tau at baseline. This is important for the field that we understand the prognostic factor of tau, and that was able to be earned. But what we saw in the trial was all patients benefited regardless of tau level with those early in the disease doing even better. It's one of the reasons that we remain so enthusiastic about TRAILBLAZER-3. And while Dan didn't mention that in his remarks, I think we remain even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to intervene earlier based on what we saw in that early population, the people with low tau and those that had no tau with such strong biomarker results. I think you probably remember the data that patients in the earliest part of our study had a 60% slowing. And we believe that could be even stronger as you get into the earlier patients that are preclinical. \n But maybe just one remark. In the meantime, though, this is not time loss. We'll continue to make sure the health care system is ready. We're going to make sure that we launch into an even stronger market with potential approval. So we're making the most of this time and look forward to the outcomes, as Dan said, in mid-'24 and answering any questions that they have. \nOperator: Next question will be from David Risinger from Leerink Partners. \nDavid Risinger: And let me add my congrats on the progress and the guidance raise. So my question is on orforglipron. Novo Nordisk has raised some concerns about the scalability of orforglipron manufacturing given its complexity. I haven't spoken to Novo directly, but someone told me that they mentioned there are 35 steps in the process. I don't know if that's true. But could you please discuss how Lilly is building out its manufacturing capacity and whether the company expects to be able to meet global demand in the Western world after launch in 2026? Or whether we, the investment community, should expect supply constraints and should be guarded about how we try to model orforglipron's ramp after launch? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Dave. I'll hand over to our Dave Ricks here. \nDavid Ricks: Okay. Great. Dave, great to hear from you. I mean, first of all, it is true that orforglipron is a complicated large small molecule, a large small molecule, if you were, and there are many steps in the process. You can read about them in our patent filings, I think. \n But Lilly, maybe unlike other companies, we've made small molecules for a long time. We're capable of doing it. We understand how to put them together, and we've got a defined process to do it for orforglipron. \n So the API production, while a long process and maybe complicated relative to other small molecules, is something we're super confident in and have our arms around. The finish process is really the big advance over using injectables because here, we're just tablet stamping or tablet -- capsule making, which are dry processes we understand extremely well. \n I think the big gain here will be the fact that both for synthetic chemistry and capsule making and tablet making, there is already capacity on planet Earth that is significant. And so unlike the parenteral side where we've been talking about injectables, a new capacity needs to be built in which we're doing aggressively, as Anat commented on earlier. Here, there's a lot of partners we can access as well as our own substantial network for dry product finish and API production. So pretty confident here. \n Now will we stick the landing on exact doses and quantities in every instance? We're not guaranteeing that, but I think the picture will be quite a bit different should orforglipron prove to be safe and effective in the Phase III studies. Again, that's in '25, so we can expect launch maybe a year after that, and that's an important event in the time course of the incretin class. \nOperator: Next question is coming from Louise Chen from Cantor. \nLouise Chen: I just wanted to ask you about your next wave of obesity drug. It looks like you've got half a dozen of these in development. And where do you think you can most differentiate yourself? \nJoe Fletcher: Dan, do you want to comment on earlier phase obesity? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Louise. We're excited about that portfolio of earlier-stage obesity molecules. I think there's a number of opportunities for improvement over even an excellent drug like tirzepatide. We think about the quality of weight loss as one aspect. So for example, even on tirzepatide, we see the ratio of lean to fat mass approved as patients lose weight on these drugs. Could we make it improve even faster with the muscle stimulating agents like bimagrumab? But maybe that's under investigation. \n Tirzepatide is very well tolerated, but some people stop taking it because of GI side effects. Could we have drugs that have fewer side effects? Maybe that could be possible. Tirzepatide is given as a once a weekly injection. Most patients find that to be acceptable. But probably with less frequent injections, that could lower the burden on manufacturing and make it easier to use for patients. So that's another avenue of exploration. \n There are some patients who don't achieve their desired levels of weight loss even on a powerful drug like tirzepatide. And so that's another avenue. \n Finally, across different indications, and I spoke earlier of NASH, that are related to metabolic disease, there could be different activities that proved more or less beneficial for these other related diseases. So that's another avenue of differentiation. \n I think we're just at the beginning of probably what will be seen as a multi-decade investments in treating abnormal metabolism and all diseases that come with that. And I'm really proud and pleased that Lilly has what must be the strongest pipeline in this area in the industry. \nOperator: The next question is from Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. Paul, next question? \nChris Shibutani: Can you hear me? \nJoe Fletcher: Oh,  yes, there you are. Go ahead, Chris. \nChris Shibutani: Wanted to ask about the supply and dynamic -- and the demand and when those two might come closer together? Previously, Anat, you've been quite specific in your vocabulary and saying that, that was something that could possibly happen in 2025. Dave, you were in front of a group that we hosted and I think you gave a little bit of a broader range. What's the latest that you would like to communicate based upon all the progress that you're making, the acquisition of Wisconsin facility, et cetera, about a potential timing for that supply-demand dynamic to come closer together? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Chris. Anat? \nAnat Ashkenazi: Yes. Let me start on this. So I would say that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that the supply and demand situation will remain quite tight in the near term as well as the midterm. And just to clarify, it's not that we have a production issue. Our manufacturing facilities are progressing incredibly well, and I'm incredibly proud of the work done by our M&Q colleagues around the world. Clearly, we have sites working 24/7. We're doing construction overnight. We're making the right investments and so we're progressing rapidly as you've seen evidenced by the results as well as the raise we did for the year. \n But the demand is strong, which shouldn't be a surprise given the health benefits that these products provide to patients, highly efficacious and safe medicines. And I expect that this will continue through the year, even with the significant ramp that we have, and we'll add more supply across different presentations, both with the auto-injector as well as the KwikPen. But even with that, I expect that the demand will be -- will outpace supply through this year. Potentially next year, obviously, we'll see. We'll continue to invest and ramp as we go into next year, but it could be quite some time. \n We talked earlier about orforglipron, should we have positive Phase III readout that provides another relief valve in terms of just offering a different presentation, as Dave mentioned, which utilizes a different set of infrastructure within our manufacturing organization available capacity globally. So it will be in a stepwise fashion. We'll continue to update investors as we progress through the year and coming years. \nOperator: Next question will be from Carter Gould from Barclays. \nCarter L. Gould: I wanted to dive into bimagrumab ahead of the Phase IIb data forthcoming. Can you talk for a bit around the importance of showing stat sig or clear dose response across the composition of the weight loss drivers and maybe as well as the importance of not blunting the overall weight loss as you contemplate a move to Phase III potentially? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Carter, for the question. Dan, you want to comment on bimagrumab? \nDaniel Skovronsky: Yes. Thanks, Carter. It's a good question. Bimagrumab is a very different mechanism of weight loss versus incretins but one that we think could be important in combination with incretins. So bimagrumab, we think will likely have important effects on adipose tissue as well as muscle mass. And so our hope is to see increased muscle mass and increased ratio, I should say, of lean to fat mass by combining bimagrumab with incretins. \n In this present study, it's being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide at different doses. So we'll see if weight loss effects on fat tissue stack and we'll see if effects on lean body mass that we're seeing in previous bimagrumab monotherapy studies work in combination with incretin. Looking forward to seeing that data. \nOperator: The next question is coming from Kripa Devarakonda from Truist Securities. \nSrikripa Devarakonda: Congrats on all the progress. I have a question about your radiopharma pipeline. You mentioned PNT2002 in your oncology pipeline. Can you talk about how you see that advancing? And given what you've seen so far, where you see this being placed in the landscape in terms of market share? \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Kripa, for the question. Jake, calling you to maybe opine a little bit on our radioligand efforts, PNT2001 in particular? \nJacob Van Naarden: Yes, happy to. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, and we are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves. So I expect we'll have more to talk about in terms of additional medicines over the course of the next couple of years in addition to PNT2001. \n But specific to that question, 2001 is a PSMA-directed therapy for prostate cancer conjugated to actinium, the alpha emitter. And I think while actinium holds a lot of promise over lutetium, particularly in the context of creating double-stranded DNA breaks versus single stranded and the ability to perhaps drive more efficacy for patients of prostate cancer. I think one of the limitations of the existing agents is that they probably cause too much salivary gland toxicity to be real durable products. \n And so the POINT team designed a novel PSMA-directed ligand with increased tumor uptake relative to the salivary gland in order to drive more therapeutic index using actinium as the payload. So we're just getting started with the Phase I experience right now. So I don't have a lot to say about what we're seeing just yet. But the preclinical package looked really interesting and differentiated from the other PSMA ligands that exist out there. So we're looking forward to putting it through its Phase I paces, and we'll see what we have. \n Depending on the clinical profile, I think there's the potential to improve outcomes in patients that have already seen a lutetium-based agent maybe go ahead of that and compete with the lutetium-based agents or perhaps even go even earlier in therapy as PSMA expression really exists in the continuum of prostate cancer care. So more to come on that as we define the clinical profile in the Phase I. \nJoe Fletcher: Paul, I think we've got time for maybe one more question. We're right at 11. So maybe a final question in the queue. \nOperator: Okay. And the final question today is coming from James Shin from Deutsche Bank. \nJames Shin: I just wanted to try and reconcile the guidance lift with the 1.5x saleable doses being maintained. \nJoe Fletcher: Okay. James, maybe I'll give to Anat to talk about the guidance and how the guidance raise relates to the 1.5x dose comments. \nAnat Ashkenazi: So let's start with the 1.5 dose -- sellable dose comment that I made on the guidance call in February. So that reference is not a number of devices, but number of sellable doses. And as we ramp up capacity for KwikPen, recall that unlike the single-use vial or the auto-injector, that KwikPen is a multidose device that has multiple doses available for patients. \n That comment referred to the second half of this year versus the second half of last year. So we're expecting that total saleable doses this year in the second half will be at least 1.5x where we were second half of last year. That remains unchanged. But the level of confidence we have in our ability to progress on each node of our capacity that's coming online or will get approved, et cetera, has just increased. There are multiple of these throughout the year. Multiple of these have occurred. Some will occur as -- I gave the KwikPen as one example. \n Think about a construction of a site, for example, Concord in North Carolina, which we said will become operational by end of the year, and we'll start seeing products next year. That construction has concluded. Lines are installed, and we need to run qualifications, get approval, et cetera. There are multiple nodes of these across our own manufacturing sites as well as external and that they all need to come online to get to where we need in terms of the full year guidance. But our confidence as the year progresses -- as the year has progressed, our confidence in that has increased, but it remains the -- at least 1.5. \nJoe Fletcher: Thanks, Anat. Great. Well, thanks for your time today, everyone, and we appreciate you participating in today's earnings call and your interest in our company. Please follow up with the IR team if you have any additional questions that we didn't address today, and have a great day. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Anat Ashkenazi",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Slide 6 summarizes financial performance in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter revenue growth of 26% was driven by new products, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. Gross margin as a percent of revenue increased from 78.4% in Q1 2023 to 82.5% in Q1 2024. Gross margin in the quarter benefited from higher realized prices, variable product mix and, to a lesser extent, improved production costs.  \n Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased 12% primarily driven by promotional efforts supporting current and future launches as well as increased compensation and benefit costs. R&D expenses increased 27%, driven by higher development expenses for late-stage assets and additional investments in early-stage research as well as a onetime charge of approximately $75 million associated with the termination of the Verzenio prostate program.  \n In Q1, we recognized acquired IPR&D charge of $111 million, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.10. Operating income increased 63% in Q1 driven by higher revenue from new products, partially offset by operating expense growth. Our Q1 effective tax rate was 11.9% compared to 12.8% in Q1 2023 driven by a larger net discrete tax benefit reflected in Q1 2024 compared with the same period in 2023. We delivered earnings per share of $2.58 in Q1, a 59% increase compared to Q1 2023, inclusive of the negative impact of $0.10 from acquired IPR&D charges in both periods.  \n On Slide 7, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U.S. revenue increased 28% in Q1 driven by growth of Mounjaro, Zepbound and Verzenio. Unprecedented demand for our incretin medicines led to wholesaler backorders of Trulicity, Mounjaro and Zepbound at quarter end. Realized prices in the U.S. increased 16%, largely driven by Mounjaro access and savings card dynamics.  \n Moving to Europe. Revenue growth was once again strong, increasing 29% in constant currency, driven primarily by volume from Verzenio and Mounjaro as well as payments associated with the distribution and divestiture agreements.  \n Japan revenue grew 2% in constant currency. Volume growth of 7% was driven by Mounjaro and Verzenio, partially offset by decreased volume for Trulicity and a partnership milestone in the base period.  Price declined 5% in the quarter.  \n Moving to China. Q1 revenue increased 4% in constant currency. Volume growth was driven by Tyvyt, partially offset by Olumiant and Cialis.  \n Revenue in the Rest of the World increased 31% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth from Mounjaro and to a lesser extent, Verzenio and Jardiance.  \n Slide 8 provides additional perspective across our product categories. First, I would like to highlight Verzenio, which saw worldwide sales increased 40% in Q1, driven by continued volume growth in the early breast cancer indication. Jaypirca revenue increased to $50 million worldwide, representing an acceleration in sequential quarterly growth following the December 2023 approval for the CLL indication. We're looking forward to potentially making this medicine available to even more patients as future Phase III trials read out.  \n Next in Q1, Mounjaro sales were $1.8 billion globally, and $1.5 billion in the U.S., up from $568 million and $536 million in Q1 2023, respectively. Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue for Mounjaro in the U.S. was impacted by a onetime benefit from changes in estimates for rebates and discounts in Q4 2023 as well as lower inventory in the channel in Q4 2024 and a strong demand. Access level across commercial and Part D were consistent with high levels we communicated on our last earnings call and near parity with established injectable incretin medicines.  \n The demand for tirzepatide is very strong. And each week, hundreds of thousands of people fill scripts from Mounjaro and Zepbound. Yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties yet in their medicine. While we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply. We remain on track to meet expectations we set earlier this year, the production of saleable doses of incretin medicine in the second half of 2024 will be at least 1.5x the saleable doses in the second half of 2023.  In the short to midterm, we expect sales growth to primarily be a function of the quantities we can produce and ship.  \n Outside the U.S., we're delighted that the multi-dose KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro was recently approved in the EU, adding to the U.K. approval earlier this year. This approval applies to both type 2 diabetes and chronic weight management indication as they are under the single brand in Europe. While timing for launch will vary by country, we expect to start launching in the EU in coming weeks.  \n In Q1, worldwide Trulicity revenue declined 26%. U.S. Trulicity revenue decreased 30% driven by lower volume, primarily due to supply constraints and competitive dynamics. In addition, sales in international markets were impacted by measures we have taken to minimize disruption to existing patients, including communicating to health care professionals to not start new patients on Trulicity.  \n Turning to Slide 9. We have seen exceptionally strong U.S. launch progress for Zepbound with over $0.5 billion in sales in Q1. We're rapidly building out access for Zepbound in the U.S. And as of April 1, we have approximately 67% access in the commercial segment. As a reminder, patients' access to this market is a two-step process typically require individual employers to opt in to an anti-obesity medicine rider following PBM coverage. We are continuing to focus on broadening access, both with PBMs and for employer opt-ins and early progress is encouraging.  \n On Slide 10, we provide an update on capital allocation.  \n Slide 11 shows updated 2024 financial guidance. Given the strength we're seeing in our business and projections for continued acceleration expected in the second half of the year, we're increasing our full year revenue outlook by $2 billion on the top and bottom end of the range to be between $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of Mounjaro and Zepbound and greater visibility and confidence into our production expansion for the remainder of 2024.  With this update, year-over-year revenue growth of the company is now expected to be approximately 26% at the midpoint or approximately 35% for the core business, which excludes the impact from global divestitures.\n Given the update to revenue guidance, we now expect the ratio of gross margin less OpEx divided by revenue to be in the range of 32% to 34% on a reported basis and 33% to 35% on a non-GAAP basis, representing further margin expansion. We're reaffirming guidance for other income and expense and tax rate, which now takes into consideration Q1 results.  \n Based on these updates, and inclusive of Q1 IPR&D charges of $0.10 per share, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.05 to $13.55 on a reported basis and $13.50 to $14 on a non-GAAP basis.  \n Now I'll turn the call over to Dan to highlight progress in R&D. Thanks for the question, Chris. And as we've mentioned earlier in the year when we issued guidance, we said that we expect capacity and supply to ramp towards the second half of the year, and that's what we're seeing. \n Now as a reminder, we do have quite a large number of nodes across our supply chain that have to come online or ramp capacity. We are -- if you look at everything we have under construction, or ramping up, we have six sites right now between the two sites in North Carolina, a site in Ireland, two sites in Indiana, a site in Germany and then a seventh one that we just purchased, they are all either ramping up or under construction. \n And there are multiple nodes across that supply chain that have to become operational, which requires approval, et cetera, for three products, depending on which product runs on which line, that are planned throughout the year. \n Now that we're 4 months into the year, we have greater visibility into that -- into these nodes of capacity and feel more confident. Just as one example, the approval of the KwikPen in Europe that just came in slightly ahead of our expectation gives us additional confidence in our ability to launch KwikPen for patients in Europe. \n So it is across our sites globally as well as ramping up capacity with partners or CDMOs as well as in existing sites where we're making investments to expand where we can or ramp up capacity. So it's across our supply chain. Yes. Let me start on this. So I would say that, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect that the supply and demand situation will remain quite tight in the near term as well as the midterm. And just to clarify, it's not that we have a production issue. Our manufacturing facilities are progressing incredibly well, and I'm incredibly proud of the work done by our M&Q colleagues around the world. Clearly, we have sites working 24/7. We're doing construction overnight. We're making the right investments and so we're progressing rapidly as you've seen evidenced by the results as well as the raise we did for the year. \n But the demand is strong, which shouldn't be a surprise given the health benefits that these products provide to patients, highly efficacious and safe medicines. And I expect that this will continue through the year, even with the significant ramp that we have, and we'll add more supply across different presentations, both with the auto-injector as well as the KwikPen. But even with that, I expect that the demand will be -- will outpace supply through this year. Potentially next year, obviously, we'll see. We'll continue to invest and ramp as we go into next year, but it could be quite some time. \n We talked earlier about orforglipron, should we have positive Phase III readout that provides another relief valve in terms of just offering a different presentation, as Dave mentioned, which utilizes a different set of infrastructure within our manufacturing organization available capacity globally. So it will be in a stepwise fashion. We'll continue to update investors as we progress through the year and coming years. So let's start with the 1.5 dose -- sellable dose comment that I made on the guidance call in February. So that reference is not a number of devices, but number of sellable doses. And as we ramp up capacity for KwikPen, recall that unlike the single-use vial or the auto-injector, that KwikPen is a multidose device that has multiple doses available for patients. \n That comment referred to the second half of this year versus the second half of last year. So we're expecting that total saleable doses this year in the second half will be at least 1.5x where we were second half of last year. That remains unchanged. But the level of confidence we have in our ability to progress on each node of our capacity that's coming online or will get approved, et cetera, has just increased. There are multiple of these throughout the year. Multiple of these have occurred. Some will occur as -- I gave the KwikPen as one example. \n Think about a construction of a site, for example, Concord in North Carolina, which we said will become operational by end of the year, and we'll start seeing products next year. That construction has concluded. Lines are installed, and we need to run qualifications, get approval, et cetera. There are multiple nodes of these across our own manufacturing sites as well as external and that they all need to come online to get to where we need in terms of the full year guidance. But our confidence as the year progresses -- as the year has progressed, our confidence in that has increased, but it remains the -- at least 1.5."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks so much for the question. And we are incredibly confident in donanemab's potential and the fact that it offers very meaningful benefits to people with early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease and just the overall approvability of the package. We do look forward to seeing there's questions. We haven't received those yet. I think that what we'll anticipate really is discussions around the safety and efficacy of donanemab. And those -- the safety and efficacy profile remain very consistent with what we published and presented. So nothing new there. \n We do expect there's a couple of unique aspects to our trial that we anticipate they'll want to discuss. One is around limited duration dosing. We think this is an incredibly important feature of donanemab, the chance to stop dosing when you've cleared the plaques. And donanemab clears them robustly and rapidly so we think that allows for this limited duration dosing approach. So we really do look forward to getting into that data and having the advisers see that and respond to it. \n Another unique aspect is assessing tau at baseline. This is important for the field that we understand the prognostic factor of tau, and that was able to be earned. But what we saw in the trial was all patients benefited regardless of tau level with those early in the disease doing even better. It's one of the reasons that we remain so enthusiastic about TRAILBLAZER-3. And while Dan didn't mention that in his remarks, I think we remain even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to intervene earlier based on what we saw in that early population, the people with low tau and those that had no tau with such strong biomarker results. I think you probably remember the data that patients in the earliest part of our study had a 60% slowing. And we believe that could be even stronger as you get into the earlier patients that are preclinical. \n But maybe just one remark. In the meantime, though, this is not time loss. We'll continue to make sure the health care system is ready. We're going to make sure that we launch into an even stronger market with potential approval. So we're making the most of this time and look forward to the outcomes, as Dan said, in mid-'24 and answering any questions that they have."

            "name": "Daniel Skovronsky",
            "content": "Thanks, Anat. Let me start with our exciting announcement from earlier this month. That was the positive Phase III results from the SURMOUNT-OSA studies, which evaluated tirzepatide for treatment of adults with obesities and moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea known as OSA. OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by complete or partial collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA can have serious cardiometabolic complications contributing to hypertension, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and even type 2 diabetes.  \n The need is significant. OSA impacts 80 million people in the U.S. with more than 20 million people suffering from moderate to severe OSA. We also know that a substantial majority, approximately 70% of people with OSA also live with obesity.  While there are pharmaceutical treatments for the excessive daytime sleepiness associated with OSA, tirzepatide could potentially be the first pharmacological treatment for the underlying disease.  \n As shown on Slide 12, SURMOUNT-OSA was comprised of two separate trials run under one master protocol. Study 1 evaluated tirzepatide in participants not currently on positive airway pressure or PAP therapy, while Study 2 evaluates tirzepatide in patients who had used PAP for at least 3 months prior to the study and plans to continue PAP therapy during the entire course of the trial. A total of 469 participants were enrolled across these studies. Each study randomized participants to either maximum tolerated dose approved for tirzepatide, which can be 10 milligrams or 15 milligrams, or to placebo. And patients were followed on therapy for 52 weeks.  \n On Slide 13, we show the results of Study 1. For the efficacy estimate on mean Apnea-Hypopnea Index, or AHI, tirzepatide led to a mean reduction of 27.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 4.8 events per hour for placebo. This difference was highly statistically significant. AHI baseline values were 52.9 and AHI was reduced by 55% in the tirzepatide arm. We also saw a mean body rate reduction of 18.1% for tirzepatide treatment consistent with our expectations for the study. This was, of course, also statistically significant versus placebo.  \n On Slide 14, we show the results of Study 2. In this population, for the efficacy [ estimand ], tirzepatide led to a mean AHI reduction of 30.4 events per hour compared to a mean AHI reduction of 6.0 events per hour for placebo. The baseline AHI was 46.1% in the tirzepatide arm and mean AHI reduction was 62.8%. Again, we saw impressive weight loss with a mean body rate reduction of 20.1% from baseline. These results were also all highly statistically significant.  \n In both studies, the overall safety profile was similar to previously reported SURMOUNT and SURPASS trials. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal-related and generally mild to moderate in severity, with the most commonly reported gastrointestinal adverse events for patients treated with tirzepatide being diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and constipation. \n Prior to the study readout, we noted investor questions about what level of weight loss we would see given several factors that were uniquely combined in the study of tirzepatide. First, the primary aim of the study was not treatment of obesity. Second, that the population was approximately 70% males, in whom weight loss can be harder to achieve with incretin medicines. Third, there's a particularly high baseline BMI in this population. And finally, the use of the 10- or 15-milligram maximum tolerated dose approach. We were therefore highly reassured to see weight loss observed across the two studies at 52 weeks was nearly 20% despite this difficult-to-treat population.  \n Consistent with other Phase III studies of tirzepatide at the 52-week time point, we did not see weight loss plateau. We'll present detailed results of SURMOUNT-OSA during a symposium at ADA on June 21. Additionally, we plan to submit to the FDA and other global regulatory agencies beginning midyear.  \n Moving to the other updates across our portfolio. Slide 15 shows select pipeline opportunities as of April 26, and Slide 16 shows potential key events for the year. We're pleased to share that results were positive in QWINT-4, the first Phase III study of insulin efsitora alfa, our once-weekly basal insulin. This study evaluated efsitora compared to insulin glargine in adult participants with type 2 diabetes who are on multiple daily insulin injections. In the coming weeks, we expect to report top line results from QWINT-4 as well as QWINT\tT-2 which is evaluating efsitora compared to degludec in adults with type 2 diabetes who are naive to basal insulin.  \n Together, these are the first 2 of 5 studies in the efsitora Phase III program.  \n Additional updates in our late-stage diabetes and obesity pipeline include results of the EMPACT-MI study, showing Jardiance had a 10% relative risk reduction in the primary composite endpoint of time-to-first hospitalization due to heart failure or all-cause mortality versus placebo, which did not reach statistical significance. \n We've completed enrollment for SURMOUNT-MMO with over 15,000 participants, and for both orforglipron studies in chronic weight management, ATTAIN-1 and ATTAIN-2, which together enrolled 4,500 participants.  \n Finally, we've now initiated the [ TRANSCEND ] Phase III program studying retatrutide in type 2 diabetes.  \n In the cardiovascular disease area, we're excited to have initiated the Phase III trial for lepodisiran, the subcutaneous injectable siRNA. This study will evaluate the efficacy in improving cardiovascular outcomes for participants with high lipoprotein A, who have cardiovascular disease or at a risk of heart attack or stroke. We are evaluating the efficacy of lepodisiran in both secondary and high-risk primary prevention. And we hope this will one day offer health care providers a treatment option for a broad group of patients at increased cardiovascular risk due to high LP(a) levels.  \n Earlier in our diabetes and obesity pipeline, we've now initiated a Phase II monotherapy study evaluating eloralintide, our selective amylin receptor agonist in obesity.  \n Turning to oncology. We made the decision to terminate for futility, the Phase III CYCLONE 3 trial evaluating Verzenio in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer following an interim analysis. This concludes development of Verzenio in prostate cancer following last quarter's announcement that the CYCLONE 2 study did not meet its primary endpoint. \n In early oncology development, we've initiated Phase I trials for two new assets. The first is our Nectin-4 ADC, which came from our acquisition of Emergence Therapeutics. The second is PNT2001, which came from our acquisition of POINT Biopharma. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in our oncology portfolio and expect 2024 to be particularly productive. Along with the Nectin-4 ADC and PNT2001 start, we expect at least three other new molecules to enter the clinic this year. We look forward to sharing more details with the investment community at an oncology-focused investor event hosted by the Lilly Oncology team. This event will take place on the evening of Sunday, June 2 in Chicago in conjunction with the ASCO annual meeting and will also be available via webcast. We plan to provide an update on our oncology strategy and pipeline opportunities. Additional details will be available soon regarding this event.  \n Turning to Neuroscience. Last month, we announced that the FDA plans to convene a meeting of the peripheral and CNS Drugs Advisory Committee to discuss donanemab in early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease. We expect the advisory committee meeting will take place in mid-2024, but the exact date will be confirmed when it appears in the Federal Register. We expect the focus to be around the safety and efficacy profile of donanemab, along with unique aspects of the clinical program. We remain confident in donanemab's potential to offer very meaningful benefits to patients and look forward to addressing the FDA's questions in this form.  \n Additionally, we made the decision to discontinue investigation of GBA1, our gene therapy assets in Gaucher disease type 2. Phase II studies in Parkinson's disease and Gaucher disease type 1 are still underway and have not been impacted by this decision.  \n Finally, in immunology, we've submitted mirikizumab to the FDA and EMA for approval for use in adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. In the U.S., we've resubmitted lebrikizumab's application to the FDA for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. This is following a complete response letter based on inspection findings of the third-party manufacturer. As a reminder, the letter stated no concerns with the clinical data package safety or label. We expect regulatory action in the second half of this year.  \n We're also announcing that in the coming months, we'll be initiating Phase III studies evaluating lebrikizumab in two new indications: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and allergic rhinitis due to perennial allergens. Lebrikizumab will be the first biologic to be evaluated in Phase III for allergic rhinitis. We're optimistic about the potential of lebrikizumab to be an important treatment option in these patient populations as well as in atopic dermatitis. In earlier-stage immunology development, we've advanced our CD19 antibody into Phase II for multiple sclerosis.  \n I'll now turn the call back to Dave for closing remarks. Thanks, Seamus. So I'll start with the last part there. Yes, the abstract was accepted and will be presented at EASL early June. So that will be the opportunity to see the full NASH package from that Phase II trial. \n Like we said in the last call, really exciting data. We shared some of the top line. I think tirzepatide can have a profound effect on this disease. It's a Phase II trial. Next steps here are to discuss with the FDA what the best path forward could be for tirzepatide. \n You're pointing out, though, that we have another choice in retatrutide which, based on biomarker data from earlier studies, could also have a profound effect of this disease. That molecule has the addition of glucagon, which is likely to have additional benefits in the liver. So important opportunities ahead and good-to-have options as we go into these discussions with regulators. \n I think for MASH, like other obesity-related or metabolic related diseases, Lilly has a pretty broad portfolio, and we'll just continue to push the science to make the best possible medicines for patients. Yes, sure, Tim. It's probably more of your job than ours to speculate on competitor readouts but I'll take a stab at it since you asked. I think on AMG 133, we've just seen really a small amount of data. So probably anything is possible and like you will be interested to see their results. Of course, there's arguments that can be heard about GIP agonism versus antagonism. We've placed our bets, and we like the data we got with GIP agonism. \n On CagriSema, of course, adding more agonism on different pathways on top of GLP-1 is a good idea. That's what we have with tirzepatide, is a dual agonist. So CagriSema makes sense. And you'll note that we've advanced our amylin agonist to Phase II. \n Tirzepatide already is a dual agonist. Retatrutide is already a triple agonist. There's probably more we could do here at Lilly. I think across our portfolio, in Phase I and Phase II, we have nine assets that are marked for diabetes or obesity. Many of them could lead to additive weight loss on top of established mechanisms plus two more in Phase III, of course. So we have a strong portfolio here. I think tirzepatide still has unsurpassed efficacy at weight loss, but we're preparing for our next generation assets as well. Yes, there are a lot of good questions in there. Thanks for following so closely. So on the GIP, the long-acting molecule, I think primarily in that experiment, we were excited to show the benefits of isolated GIP agonism, just to answer some mechanism of action questions around tirzepatide. But as you point out, there's potential for that molecule for other indications or as a monotherapy or combination with other mechanisms. \n But of course, since tirzepatide already includes GIP agonism, we're also excited to explore other mechanisms. So that's where [ elora ], which is 1 of 9 different mechanisms, as I said a moment ago that we're exploring the long-acting amylin moved forward to Phase II. That has potential perhaps as a combination therapy, perhaps as a maintenance therapy, perhaps as a monotherapy, there's a lot to explore. It's still very early as it is for all of our mechanisms. So we'll keep investing and as we have data to share, we'll do that. Yes. Thanks, Kerry, for the good questions here. You're right, we haven't yet published a Phase II data. But I think we just recently were able to publish the Phase I data. That was really exciting and well received. I think one of the things that people noted in our Phase I data was a very long durability of action and a very deep reduction in Lp(a) levels following a single dose of lepodisiran. We now have, of course, a Phase II data in hand and use that to design and begin the Phase III trial. \n I think we haven't quite disclosed dose or frequency yet, but I'm sure that will happen in time. You asked about differentiation. I think there's probably a couple of different potentials for differentiation here versus a shorter-acting ASO and a siRNA that are both in Phase III studies. Maybe first is the depth of clearance of Lp(a), we don't know how much you have to reduce Lp(a) to lead to benefits in cardiovascular outcomes and whether there's a threshold effect or a floor to this. So the depth of clearance is one. \n The second, as you asked about, could be frequency of administration or durability of action, those two being closely linked. And the third, of course, is the population that's being studied into -- I noted we're studying secondary as well as primary prevention here. So I think we have a good package with multiple opportunities for differentiation and eager to test the Lp(a) hypothesis here this Phase III study. Sure. Thanks, Steve. As you know, we do our best not to comment on interim analyses, although many of our different trials can incorporate interim analyses. But when we do talk about the risks, unintentional unblinding of results, for that reason, we prefer not to do that. \n You're right that the primary analysis of the study and the design is around noninferiority versus what we are ready to know to be a very good drug that reduces cardiovascular risk, and that's Trulicity. So it's designed as a noninferiority trial. Of course, when the final data come, we would be delighted to see even superiority. \n You asked about our confidence. Confidence continues to increase for this readout. In fact, as disclosed in the prepared remarks today, we got additional data here even from the OSA study that should make us feel more confident, not just the benefit in sleep apnea, which itself could lead to cardiovascular benefits, but actually the weight loss. And I think there are some concerns about weight loss of different populations and different trials and males, females, et cetera. So some of that was discharged here. So we remain excited and look forward to getting that data when the study's complete. Yes. Thanks, Louise. We're excited about that portfolio of earlier-stage obesity molecules. I think there's a number of opportunities for improvement over even an excellent drug like tirzepatide. We think about the quality of weight loss as one aspect. So for example, even on tirzepatide, we see the ratio of lean to fat mass approved as patients lose weight on these drugs. Could we make it improve even faster with the muscle stimulating agents like bimagrumab? But maybe that's under investigation. \n Tirzepatide is very well tolerated, but some people stop taking it because of GI side effects. Could we have drugs that have fewer side effects? Maybe that could be possible. Tirzepatide is given as a once a weekly injection. Most patients find that to be acceptable. But probably with less frequent injections, that could lower the burden on manufacturing and make it easier to use for patients. So that's another avenue of exploration. \n There are some patients who don't achieve their desired levels of weight loss even on a powerful drug like tirzepatide. And so that's another avenue. \n Finally, across different indications, and I spoke earlier of NASH, that are related to metabolic disease, there could be different activities that proved more or less beneficial for these other related diseases. So that's another avenue of differentiation. \n I think we're just at the beginning of probably what will be seen as a multi-decade investments in treating abnormal metabolism and all diseases that come with that. And I'm really proud and pleased that Lilly has what must be the strongest pipeline in this area in the industry. Yes. Thanks, Carter. It's a good question. Bimagrumab is a very different mechanism of weight loss versus incretins but one that we think could be important in combination with incretins. So bimagrumab, we think will likely have important effects on adipose tissue as well as muscle mass. And so our hope is to see increased muscle mass and increased ratio, I should say, of lean to fat mass by combining bimagrumab with incretins. \n In this present study, it's being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with semaglutide at different doses. So we'll see if weight loss effects on fat tissue stack and we'll see if effects on lean body mass that we're seeing in previous bimagrumab monotherapy studies work in combination with incretin. Looking forward to seeing that data."

            "content": "Thank you very much, Mohit. When you look at the pricing of Mounjaro, I think it's important to take into account that in the Q4 earnings, we announced a onetime adjustment for Mounjaro in Q4 that was quite significant. So it was a onetime adjustment in the base of Q4. \n When we look forward for the first half of 2024, it's important to have in mind that we also terminated the $25 saving card 6/30/2023, but patients that were on are grandfathered until 6/30/2024. So there would probably be some benefits during the first half of 2024 for Mounjaro. But from the second half of this year, we should expect to see typical pricing headwinds for Mounjaro as well. Thank you very much, Umer. I think with the announcement made by the CMS early April to reimburse comorbidities for obesity based upon the SELECT trial, we're also confident that with the new data that we presented just weeks ago in terms of obstructive sleep apnea, that's going to be reimbursed in Medicare Part D. And we expect similarly for other comorbidities and the readout of HFpEF, assuming that's positive and approved, and later on with the mobility-mortality outcome study. \n Still, our true north is really to get the true Treat and Reduce Obesity Act cost, and we strongly believe it's not a matter of if but when. We don't see it likely to pass in 2024, but there is still a small likelihood that that's going to happen. Thanks very much, Terence. When it comes to LillyDirect, I think we are very pleased with the start. And when we look at the utilization by consumers, it's gaining traction by weeks here. \n If we look at the TRx data of Q1, particularly for Zepbound, it's relatively low volume that goes through LillyDirect, slightly higher in terms of NBRx. It's our understanding that what goes through LillyDirect is not by default captured by IQVIA. But IQVIA has a methodology in place to estimate what goes through LillyDirect as well. Thanks, Trung. Now based upon what CMS stated early April, we actually expect to get obstructive sleep apnea for Zepbound covered by CMS and Medicare at the time of launch. And the next one then would be HFpEF assuming a positive readout and approval. And the third one would be the MMO indication. That's the sequence of our plans, assuming everything goes according to plan and we get the approval for both."

            "name": "David Ricks",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Joe. We're pleased with our Q1 results and the continued momentum in our business, which positions us well for accelerated growth as this year progresses. Our focus is to bring innovative medicines to people in need. And in 2024, we're investing in our people, our launches, expanding our pipeline of new medicines, including through business development, and of course, accelerating the needed capacity in our manufacturing network. Results this quarter represent a continuation of the strong growth we delivered in 2023.  \n On Slide 4, you can see details of the financial performance and progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 26% in Q1 with our new products growing nearly $1.8 billion compared with the same period last year. We achieved several key pipeline milestones, including the positive Phase III results for tirzepatide in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea, the approval of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery device for Mounjaro in Europe, submission of mirikizumab in the U.S. and in the EU for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease, the resubmission of lebrikizumab in the U.S. for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and the initiation of our Phase III study for lepodisiran, evaluating efficacy and reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n Lilly's top priority is to ensure we execute on our ambitious manufacturing expansion agenda. We recently signed an agreement to acquire an injectable medicine facility from Nexus Pharmaceuticals in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. This state-of-the-art facility has been FDA approved, and we are targeting to initiate production at the end of 2025. We broke ground earlier this month on our previously announced parenteral manufacturing site in Germany. And in existing facilities, we are working to maximize output and productivity to meet demand.  \n The recent EMA approval and upcoming launch of our multi-dose KwikPen delivery life for Mounjaro will unlock new supply capacity for Europe and other international markets. While we are also seeing meaningful progress in the ramp of new lines in existing Lilly and CDMO sites for the United States.  \n We continue to make progress against our plans to increase manufacturing capacity, the most ambitious expansion plan in our company's history. Lastly, we distributed over $1 billion in dividends during the first quarter.  \n On Slide 5, you'll see a list of the key events since our Q4 earnings call, including the milestones I mentioned earlier and several other important updates.  \n So now let me turn the call over to Anat to review our Q1 financial results. Okay. Thanks, Dan. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly sum up the progress in our first quarter. Strong revenue growth in Q1 was driven by our recent product launches, primarily Mounjaro and Zepbound. We expect acceleration in revenue growth through the second half of the year as supply of incretin medicines continues to ramp. Significant advances in our pipeline include top line data from tirzepatide and SURMOUNT-OSA, approval of the KwikPen delivery device from Mounjaro in the EU, submission of mirikizumab and lebrikizumab as well as initiation of lepodisiran  Phase III study, as Dan just mentioned. We are continuing to invest in recent and upcoming launches, internal and external pipeline development and our manufacturing expansion agenda. This is to sustain our long-term growth outlook.\n So now let me turn the call over to Joe to moderate the Q&A session. Yes. Sure. And Ilya can add to this. As we think we've said on several calls now, our goal is to pursue all of the above, basically as it relates to supply options, recognizing the tremendous demand and unmet need and the constraints that exist in scaling the supply chain. So KwikPen uses existing assets, so there was less time lag. We see this first in the U.K. and now in Europe as a way to meet the needs of those patients. But we haven't ruled it out in other jurisdictions. And so we'll continue to look at every option we can to meet the needs of patients with obesity and overweight as well as with diabetes. Okay. Great. Dave, great to hear from you. I mean, first of all, it is true that orforglipron is a complicated large small molecule, a large small molecule, if you were, and there are many steps in the process. You can read about them in our patent filings, I think. \n But Lilly, maybe unlike other companies, we've made small molecules for a long time. We're capable of doing it. We understand how to put them together, and we've got a defined process to do it for orforglipron. \n So the API production, while a long process and maybe complicated relative to other small molecules, is something we're super confident in and have our arms around. The finish process is really the big advance over using injectables because here, we're just tablet stamping or tablet -- capsule making, which are dry processes we understand extremely well. \n I think the big gain here will be the fact that both for synthetic chemistry and capsule making and tablet making, there is already capacity on planet Earth that is significant. And so unlike the parenteral side where we've been talking about injectables, a new capacity needs to be built in which we're doing aggressively, as Anat commented on earlier. Here, there's a lot of partners we can access as well as our own substantial network for dry product finish and API production. So pretty confident here. \n Now will we stick the landing on exact doses and quantities in every instance? We're not guaranteeing that, but I think the picture will be quite a bit different should orforglipron prove to be safe and effective in the Phase III studies. Again, that's in '25, so we can expect launch maybe a year after that, and that's an important event in the time course of the incretin class."

            "name": "Jacob Van Naarden",
            "content": "Yes, happy to. Thanks for the question. We're really excited about bringing radiopharmaceuticals into the portfolio by way of the acquisition of POINT Biopharma, and we are supplementing that acquisition with additional work through our discovery labs and the ability to make these medicines ourselves. So I expect we'll have more to talk about in terms of additional medicines over the course of the next couple of years in addition to PNT2001. \n But specific to that question, 2001 is a PSMA-directed therapy for prostate cancer conjugated to actinium, the alpha emitter. And I think while actinium holds a lot of promise over lutetium, particularly in the context of creating double-stranded DNA breaks versus single stranded and the ability to perhaps drive more efficacy for patients of prostate cancer. I think one of the limitations of the existing agents is that they probably cause too much salivary gland toxicity to be real durable products. \n And so the POINT team designed a novel PSMA-directed ligand with increased tumor uptake relative to the salivary gland in order to drive more therapeutic index using actinium as the payload. So we're just getting started with the Phase I experience right now. So I don't have a lot to say about what we're seeing just yet. But the preclinical package looked really interesting and differentiated from the other PSMA ligands that exist out there. So we're looking forward to putting it through its Phase I paces, and we'll see what we have. \n Depending on the clinical profile, I think there's the potential to improve outcomes in patients that have already seen a lutetium-based agent maybe go ahead of that and compete with the lutetium-based agents or perhaps even go even earlier in therapy as PSMA expression really exists in the continuum of prostate cancer care. So more to come on that as we define the clinical profile in the Phase I."
