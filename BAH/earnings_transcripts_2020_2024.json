At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instruction].I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Nick Veasey. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nNick Veasey: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020 earnings announcement. We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. I'm Nick Veasey, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me to talk about our business and financial results are: Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking, and therefore are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company\u2019s services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer, included in our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call.During today's call, we will also discuss the non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2020 slides.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 5.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope that you, your families and your colleagues have been healthy and safe since we last spoke. It\u2019s been eight weeks since we Booz Allen's fiscal year 2020 ended. But March feels like a distant memory, given all that has transpired since then. Our world, our communities, and our institutions have taken drastic, necessary steps to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its toll has been unlike anything most of us have ever experienced in terms of illness, lives lost and economic hardship. Well, first responders, doctors and nurses and all essential workers have inspired us with their actions. From everyone at Booz Allen, our heartfelt condolences to those who have lost loved ones and our deepest gratitude to every single person on the frontlines and to their families.Without a doubt, the worldwide mobilization against COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way we live and work. And so, this morning I will begin by discussing Booz Allen's response and approach going forward. Then Lloyd will build on these themes, while providing the details of our fiscal year 2020 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2021.Reflecting back to early February, when COVID-19 began spreading across the globe, our firm immediately organized a crisis response team and committed to three overriding priorities: First and foremost, to protect the health and safety of our people, their families and our communities; Second, to continue supporting the critical missions of our clients; And third, to ensure the financial and institutional resilience of our firm.These priorities have guided every decision since then, including our move to mandatory telework on March 17th. They were also at the center of our resilience program, announced on April 1st. We took bold action, creating a $100 million pandemic resilience fund, by containing and reprioritizing non-personnel costs. Using those funds to increase job security and expand benefits, we believe could relieve the initial stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic and help the most vulnerable in our communities. This in turn, will allow our people to channel their talent and energy into meeting the needs of our clients, an outcome that directly contributes to Booz Allen\u2019s growth while preserving our resiliency. I am proud of how well the Booz Allen\u2019s team responded early in this crisis and how quickly and effectively it adapted to a new reality.As we continue to learn about the virus and adjust our operations, we think about COVID-19 in three distinct phases. The first phase encompasses the crisis response I just described. And it's now behind us, roughly from the end of January through the end of April. We are now in the early weeks of a second phase, which is likely to last many months. It is characterized by a continued threat from the virus with no proven treatment or vaccine in place. Decisions for health -- Allen\u2019s public health and economic considerations largely will be made locally and at varying levels inside different institutions and organizations. The third and final phase will begin when the virus is controlled by some combination of treatments, vaccines and immunity. We ultimately expect a new normal to emerge, incorporating lasting social changes that result from the pandemic. As a business, we view this as a source of new challenges and opportunities that need to be considered and anticipated starting now.Because phase two will encompass much of fiscal year 2021, I want to summarize key decisions we've made about how we will manage through it. The health and safety of the total workforce remains our top priority. This includes not only our own people, but also those we work with every day. We have already begun talking with clients about our approach, which we are calling safe return.During this phase, we will continue to maximize telework. Our experience to-date has shown that not only does remote work reduce the spread of infection and incidence of disease, it is also highly effective. Across our firm, teams are delivering against contracts, advancing missions, hiring talent, capturing work, innovating and collaborating all via telework.We also recognize that in some cases, particularly with classified missions, there are very few options for telework where its effectiveness is limited. In these cases, we have and we'll continue to work with clients to ensure a safe return to their facilities. Guided by federal, state and local policies, as well as advice from our own experts, we are creating safe return plans in collaboration with each client. These plans consider things like social distancing rules, travel restrictions, cleaning procedures, and protections for those at high risk. Great execution of these safe return plans we believe will help keep everyone healthy and safe while maintaining critical missions. As part of phase two, we are piloting antibody testing protocols, conducting contact tracing, and fine tuning our employee benefit programs.And much like in phase one, we are managing costs, so we can execute the mitigation strategies that prove most effective. This is a complex but critical undertaking, and we are all hands on deck. Looking further down the road, after the virus is controlled and the pandemic is over, society and therefore Booz Allen will not completely go back to how things were prior to COVID-19. We are already seeing emerging themes, such as faster adoption of telehealth, virtual learning, and secure mobility solutions, for example. These changes are beginning to reshape demand. And since Booz Allen doesn't ever stand still, we're already tilting in those directions as we develop our next growth strategy.Turning now to the financials and to our current operations, it is important to underscore that we were able to quickly respond to the challenges of COVID-19 because of our talented team, and strong financial footing. Fiscal year 2020 was another outstanding year for Booz Allen. Once again, we met all of our financial objectives while serving clients with passion and dedication. Because so much of our work is mission-critical, it must continue without interruption. And the key strategic trend that fuels our business has not changed. The demand for integrated technology solutions continues to grow.Since the health emergency began, we've been in constant communication with our clients. And like all of us, they're grappling with unprecedented changes and have rallied to maintain missions in a whole new environment. Many are turning to us for support of new requirements related specifically to the government's COVID-19 response. Today, we are operating at pre-pandemic productivity levels, what I credit to our teams and our clients. In fact, about 90% of our billable work is being delivered via telework. And roughly 10% of our people who are still going into critical facilities are supported by specific plans developed in partnership with our clients to maximize everyone's safety.Our leaders are managing the business with agility, hiring against more than 1,000 sold and funded positions, aggressively pursuing new work and realigning people and resources to the areas of greatest need and opportunity.As I said many times before, this is the advantage of our business model. Our single P&L allows us to operate as one team. Throughout any crisis or disruptions, we are in it together.In sum, the management team is very pleased with how the business has adjusted to the demands of today's environment. We have entered fiscal year 2021 with confidence and momentum. We expect to deliver another year of industry-leading organic revenue growth and strong cash generation. This will allow us to continue investing in people and technologies, exploring option value opportunities for the future and delivering value to our shareholders.Given the complexity of the environment, we expect to have a strong first half, with more uncertainty in the second half. The uncertainty stems from several unknowns, including the course of the pandemic and its possible effect on our workforce and the outlook for the budget beyond the current government fiscal year. Despite the uncertainty, we are pleased to once again increase our expectations for ADEPS growth in our investment thesis. You'll recall that the thesis originally envisioned 50% ADEPS growth over a three year period from the end of fiscal year 2018 to the end of the fiscal year 2021. Last year, we increased the goal to 66% ADEPS growth over that period. The FY '21 ADEPS guidance range we are announcing today translates to 70% to 80% cumulative ADEPS growth from the end of fiscal year 2018 to the end of the fiscal year 2021.The people of Booz Allen deserve all the credit for the growth we've achieved and for sustaining our unique position in the market. Their hard work and the financial results they\u2019ve produced are the best proof points of our firm\u2019s fundamental strength and resilience.Lloyd, over to you for the details of the full year and our guidance for fiscal year 2021.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by echoing your comment about our excellent operational and financial performance in recent years. This track record has positioned Booz Allen to not simply react to the challenges of this pandemic, but to proactively address the key opportunities and risks that emerge from it. We are managing the business to ensure long-term strength just as we have done in the past with things like budget sequestrations and government shutdowns.We are investing in our people and allocating our resources efficiently as we strive to continue generating industry-leading organic revenue growth. Importantly, and as Horacio mentioned, our strength of execution has again supported an increase in the three year ADEPS growth target in our investment thesis. I will discuss this in more detail when I cover fiscal year 2021 guidance, but first I will provide an overview of our fiscal year 2020 results while highlighting the expected performance impacts of COVID-19.Our fiscal year 2020 results are shown on Slide 6. At the top-line, revenue increased 11.3% to $7.5 billion while revenue excluding billable expenses grew 9.9% to $5.2 billion. This double-digit organic growth was the result of both sustained demand for our services and solutions, and an increase in headcount to meet that demand.Turning to Slide 7, our fourth quarter book-to-bill was 0.4 times which is somewhat lower than what is typical for our Q4. As I noted during the earnings call last quarter, we are building on our strong foundation of diversified small awards by pursuing larger, more technically complex bids. This has naturally increased the volatility of our book-to-bill metrics. Nonetheless, we have entered fiscal year 2021 with enough client demand to continue growing in line with our investment thesis targets.Demand for our services and solutions remains healthy, particularly in defense and civil markets. Win rates in fiscal year 2020 were up in our qualified pipeline which includes several large new and recompete opportunities increased 31% compared to year ago levels. COVID-19 has not to-date saw significant delays in awards. Our full fiscal year book-to-bill in 2020 was 1.2 times. Total backlog grew 7% yielding our largest ever fiscal year-end backlog of $20.7 billion. Funded backlog was down 1% to $3.4 billion. Unfunded backlog was up 23% at $4.5 billion and priced options increased 5% to $12.8 billion.Pivoting to headcount, as of March 31st, we had 27,173 employees, up by 1,104 year-over-year or 4.2%. This was below our 5% headcount growth target for the year, but the revenue impact was more than offset by higher employee salaries as we continued to hire and retain talent with in demand skill sets COVID-19 has already transformed the labor market. And I am pleased with how well our recruiting efforts have transitioned to the virtual environment. And while hiring has slowed due to the pandemic, our attrition thus far has dropped by roughly half. As such, early signs point to continued headcount growth. We believe the positive hiring and retention trends we're seeing in the early weeks of this fiscal year demonstrates the wisdom of the resilience program we put in place on April 1st.Moving to the bottom-line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2020 was $754 million, up 11.8% from the previous year. This increase was driven primarily by our top-line growth, strong contract-level performance, and solid operational management. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 10.1%. This was in line with our expectations, even with an approximately $10 million end of year negative impact to EBITDA associated with COVID-19. These costs are related to transitional expenses, temporary reductions in billability in March and charges in the intelligence market we believe we may not be able to recover.On this last point, I am pleased with how well we have worked in partnership with our defense and intelligence clients, where classified work is concentrated to retain continuity of service and ensure a ready workforce. This is a challenging situation and we appreciate that the CARES Act recognize the need to keep this critical workforce ready and available. Invoicing under the terms of that law has begun and current guidance suggests that fee will need be reimbursed on certain contracts involving shift work. This affects all companies in our industry. We estimate that while temporary, it will have an impact of approximately $6 million in lost EBITDA per month. Full year 2020 net income and ADEPS also grew significantly.Net income grew 15% year-over-year to $483 million. Adjusted net income was $449 million, up 14% from fiscal year 2019. Diluted earnings per share rose to $3.41 from $2.91 in the prior year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $3.18 from $2.76 in the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by revenue growth, profitability improvement, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count in fiscal year 2020, due to our share repurchase program.Regarding our effective tax rate, during Q4, we adopted an alternative approach to identifying qualified expenditures for our research and development tax credits mentioned last quarter. As a result, we recognized approximately $38 million in tax credits this quarter net of reserves, which we excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect this method to provide additional credits in the future. And we have included the expected benefits in our guidance for effective tax rate.Turning to cash, we generated $551 million in operating cash during the fiscal year, representing 10% growth over fiscal year 2019 and putting us at the top of our forecasted range. Our strong operating cash flow, fourth quarter revolver draw and the delayed draw term loan A execution at the start of the fiscal year allowed us to end the year with $742 million in cash on hand. So far, we have not experienced material delays in cash collections due to COVID-19. The virtual invoicing practice has run smoothly due to the ongoing efforts of our team and our government partners. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 totaled $128 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology.So, I'll address forward-looking CapEx spend in the guidance section. At this point, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on facility spend is unclear. However, this is an area where we see opportunity as we adopt new ways of working. On and off, our operating performance and prudent capital management have resulted in a strong, well capitalized balance sheet. This is particularly useful in these turbulent times, as it provides tremendous strategic and operational flexibility.Please turn to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on a prudent capital allocation strategy designed to deliver both near and long-term shareholder value. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $156 million worth of shares. For the year, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares at an average price of $69 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $333 million to shareholders during fiscal year 2020, bringing total capital deployment through the first two years of our investment thesis to nearly $700 million.Looking forward, we are reiterating our $1.4 billion capital deployment target through fiscal year 2021, a key part of our investment thesis. Our priorities remain: reinvesting in our business, securing our quarterly dividends, appropriately price strategic M&A, and share repurchases and special dividends.Today, we are also announcing that the company has authorized a regular dividend of $0.31 per share payable on June 30th to stockholders of record on June 15th. Dividends remain an important component of our strategy to create value for shareholders. And we are extremely proud of the growth in our quarterly dividends, which amounts to a robust 30% growth rate for fiscal year 2020. This reflects the confidence our management has in the business and its future potential, and demonstrates our commitment to the targeted 2% yield in our investment thesis.Turning to guidance, please move to Slide 9. Last year, at this time, due to an uncertain federal budget environment, Horacio and I characterized our plan for fiscal year 2020 in two parts: an aggressive first half, followed by a more conservative second half. Today, we are operating in an unprecedented environment. And I'll characterize our guidance in a similar way.We are actively managing through the early phases of the pandemic. As Horacio described, our team and our government partners have rapidly adapted so that our nation's critical missions continue without disruption. This early success under extraordinary circumstances, plus our strong underlying fundamentals allow us to carry momentum into the first half. We remain in a growth posture, but acknowledge that there is reduced visibility into the factors that will drive performance for the full year. As Horacio noted, the second half of our fiscal year could be impacted by unknowns and related factors. These include the course of the pandemic, whether use the paid time-off returns to more typical patterns around the summer vacations, the timing and extent of our return to secured workspaces, the status of appropriations after September 30th and a possible post-election reordering of budget priorities.As a result of these uncertainties, our guidance ranges to begin the year are slightly broader than in recent years. Our fiscal year 2021 guidance is as follows.We expect revenue to grow between 6% and 10% with growth in revenue excluding billable expenses expected to be in the same range. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 10%, on par with fiscal year 2020. This margin guidance incorporates uncertain fee recovery on work invoiced per the CARES Act.At the bottom line, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.40 and $3.60. This guidance is based on 136 million to 140 million weighted averages outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. We expect to generate $550 million to $600 million in operating cash, which again to this point has not been materially impacted by COVID-19. And finally, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $80 million to $100 million. We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology, including a supportive move towards telework. To be clear, facility spend in the near term will decrease given the current environment, while our long-term strategy is still being developed as we contemplate a safe return.In closing, we are extremely proud of our fiscal year 2020 performance and pleased to be forecasting another year of robust results. Booz Allen remains on a clear and strong path delivering exceptional financial results while investing for the future. We have built significant momentum in the business and our people are as engaged and focused on our clients\u2019 missions as ever. And finally, even amidst uncertainties, the entire management team is optimistic about the year and confident that our firm can make a difference in unprecedented times.Horacio, back to you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thanks, Lloyd. The past three months have been incredibly challenging for our firm, our clients and our country. What stands out for me though is how individuals have rallied to support each other and to carry the burdens together. I'm incredibly proud of how the people of Booz Allen have responded at work and in our communities. From making personal donations that supplement our corporate contributions to food banks, first responders and military families in need, to volunteering with local charities and making face masks for colleagues, we\u2019re showing the best of Booz Allen. It shines through in their work as well. Allow me to give you just a few examples.One of our associates Sarvesh Nalluri is the heart and brain behind the data visualization project that is helping the Veterans Health Administration prepare for a possible surge of the virus in rural areas. One of our epidemiologists, Dr. Sumiko Mekaru worked on her own time with other scientists and researchers to build an openly available global COVID-19 pandemic map. She is now creating models and dashboards that will help leaders at the DoD and Defense Health Agency maintain readiness. And elsewhere in the Department of Defense, we have a team that worked around the clock for six days to move critical pre-deployment training of soldiers that is usually done in person to a completely virtual environment. Since the beginning of April, about 3,000 soldiers have received this live virtual instruction, a mandatory course that helps keep them safe while deployed.And finally, because May is Military Appreciation Month, I'll mention [Monique DiChiara] a cyber security analyst from our office in Lexington, Massachusetts. [Monique], like many others at our firm, is a member of the National Guard. She was recently activated to assist with the COVID-19 response, and led a contact tracing mission for her unit. We are so proud of her service to our country and are delighted to have her back. These and many other individual stories demonstrate the values, hard work and dedication of this firm. We're a company that mobilizes to meet any challenge or opportunity. Over the past three months, our mantra has been in it together. It conveys unity for sure. But more importantly, it underscores our institutional strength and resilience, the very things that create value for our investors and all stakeholders.So I'll close with a big thank you to the people of Booz Allen. You amaze me and inspire me each day. It is my distinct privilege to represent your work on these goals each quarter.With that Nick, let's open the line for questions.\nNick Veasey: Thanks, Horacio. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning Horacio, Lloyd and Nick and thank you for the time. Horacio, this one is for you. In May you were awarded a rather large task order under the Alliant 2 contract vehicle to support the DoD\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. I think this is the largest JAIC award to-date and Booz\u2019 second largest AI program just following eMAPS in 2018. I guess this was rather unexpected for us, were you expecting it? How do you think about contracts like this relative to your revenue growth framework? Maybe if you could tell us more about it?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Good morning, Sheila. And thanks for the question. We're obviously very pleased to have been awarded this contract. It was part of the competition and we're just very glad. As I always say on the calls the size of these contracts or task orders is important. But for me equally important is the actual content and the strategic value that they create. And in this particular case, this is an opportunity to support the JAIC, as they accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence broadly across DoD and obviously it's a mission that\u2019s near to my heart and to the people of Booz Allen, and we care about it deeply. More broadly, I think it's another proof point of our strategy as the leading provider of technology solutions to our clients. And it demonstrates that our strategy works. Artificial intelligence in general is a great example because it's both an opportunity to grow a workforce in our traditional business that scales around these new technologies and to create option value in this case with our multi-program. So all-in-all, very, very pleased and we look forward to more.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I guess I'm going to ask another follow up related to AI. Given I know that that's a focus item for Booz, as you start planning your next growth strategy, how do we think about the impact of COVID? It seems the focus right now is more on veterans\u2019 health and tracing. Is there a larger COVID opportunity when it comes to AI?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think when you look -- like you got to put things in context. Right now, it's all about the response. Our clients are very focused on that understandably. They're leveraging both existing technologies and new technologies as rapidly as possible. I think as you look forward, the need that is clear, especially when you operate at the scale of our clients, is the need to have all of this information from these disparate sources fused together, available and ready for decision making almost instantaneously. And in my view, artificial intelligence is going to be part and parcel of that. It\u2019s going to be a big deal. And that's why I'm so happy that we're both doing this work. But more importantly, we're also setting up the foundations for creating unified data environments and a lot of the things are going to be required to make this real in the long run.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Horacio, I wondered if you might expand on that a little bit in terms of the demand environment. You talked about that kind of reshaping in the aftermath of COVID. Who leads or directs that reshaping. Is that customer driven? Is that driven hand-in-hand partnership with you? Just trying to understand how you think that's going to evolve?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think it's first of all too soon to tell exactly how it's going to evolve, right? I mean we're still in the midst of a response effort. As I mentioned before, we're going into what we view as a second phase and more prolonged phase. That is going to require a lot of rethinking of how things work. And then in the third phase, once hopefully this virus is behind us, there's going to be changes that are left, that we're beginning to see. I mentioned before things like the increased adoption of telehealth, the need for secure mobility, virtual reality training. All of these things are -- they were in the works already. What we're seeing is an acceleration in need and in desire to deploy these technologies. And we are positioned to help. This has been -- from the beginning of Vision 2020 -- 2012 this has been our mantra, is we want to be at the center of our clients\u2019 mission bringing technology to solve new problems. And again, we're seeing demand across the enterprise from intelligence to defense, to certainly our health and civil business that relates to all of this.\nCarter Copeland: Great. And just as a follow-up for Lloyd. You mentioned the qualification of research expenses and generating the tax credits impacting the 2021 effective rate. How much do you envision the tax law change in \u201822 reversing that a little bit? Any color you can give us there on the step up? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure, good morning, Carter. As you know more and more of our work has been transitioning to the -- in area of -- technically advanced areas like software related engineering. So we had an opportunity to look at that. With our analysis that we mentioned last quarter, we reassessed our tax credits associated with our R&D expenditures going back to 2016 through 2019, and that yielded a net tax benefit of $38 million and -- recorded in the fourth quarter and excluded from ADEPS.Now going forward, it's, early to tell exactly what any changes there\u2019d be and the impact on it, but we expect our effective tax rate as we indicated in our guidance to be between 20% and 23% in FY \u201821. And beyond that, depending upon, the IRS\u2019 ruling to be in that range if not slightly below that given the reserve amount we made.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is open.\nJon Raviv: Horacio on those three areas that you mentioned, telehealth, virtual learning, secure mobility. Could you expand a bit on those? And sort of how those are playing out in the phase two? And how they might play out in phase three? And as you do, can you just talk about that pivot in the context of potential budget changes or budget priority changes? It seems to me that parties will change, but parties changing can actually be a place where you guys can really accelerate into some of these spaces. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Again I want to qualify this by saying we are in the midst of a rapidly changing situation and everything around us is changing. The thing that seems to be clear to us is, this needs to accelerate implementation of technology to respond to the environmental factors is, if anything, accelerating. Telehealth has become a necessity, not just a technology that is in its infancy, but a technology that is being broadly adopted. How to do that, how to do that securely, the changes that, that poses to the handling and management of the information that is provided and how all of that happens is going to have lasting effects on the requirements to continue to drive that technology.On secure mobility, everybody is working from home. That creates entire new attack surfaces and tremendous opportunities for efficiency, for effectiveness, for resiliency. And we're right in the middle of thinking through that for our own organization and helping our clients. This is a place where we're hopeful that if technology like this will defend, which we've been investing in, as you know, for several years, will come to the forefront and be very helpful.And then in terms of virtual training, again, this is a trend that was already playing out, that is accelerating, and one where we have over the years invested significantly to be very relevant to our clients, especially as we were doing [ID] response and things like that. We saw a new generation, war fighters coming in that would be more willing to learn from gamified technologies to learn from virtual reality. We have a network of labs that we've created to support that. And again, as all of this evolves, where we will see increases in demand. How that will change within a -- any timeframe based on budget priorities? As Lloyd pointed out, as I pointed out, there's some level of uncertainty around that. But what I will quote you to as it relates to us is our ability to evolve and move rapidly from one opportunity to another because of the single P&L, because of our culture, we just respond quickly to ideas. We invest in things that make sense for long-term and hopefully that makes us build to last.\nJon Raviv: Yes. Thank you for that, and then just on the margin of roughly 10% you appreciate that FY \u201821 is encompassed by phase two, if you will, with several inefficiencies associated. If you could just somehow classify or characterize how much of that 10% guidance is being held back, if you will, by the inefficiencies such as the monthly impact from the lack of fee recovery. In the same context, how mix and commercial are impacting margins at this point? Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Jon, let me first recognize that we had exceptional performance in FY \u201820 Q1 through Q3, which really allowed us to allocate the resources in Q4, not only to Horacio\u2019s point and improve upon our competitive positioning but also maintain the business momentum. And we see that and we're very pleased with that performance, despite the $10 million EBITDA COVID-related impact.Going forward, we still expect our portfolio to perform as it did in FY \u201820 and we're operating very well at the business and contract level. We feel our strategy is working. And we do have what we believe is a temporary headwind on the inability to collect fee in our -- some of our security and defense businesses. But we've taken that into account with our FY \u201821 guidance. And that's why we're affirming 10% EBITDA margins.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. You line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much and good results again in defense and civil. But you saw continuing slowing in intel and basically a decline in commercial. Can you give us some color on what's impacting that? Is there much more COVID? And what is the relative prospects going forward for fiscal \u201821? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, good morning. I'll start and I'm sure Lloyd will -- want to add. First of all, the overall results as you know are quite good. Defense and civil are up to the tune of about 15% on the year which is slightly ahead of our expectations and we're extremely happy with that. We've been talking for the last couple of calls about the fact that our intel business was not adding people as quickly as it needed to. And we made some changes to accelerate that. And I think what you're seeing is a continuation of that trend. And while at the same time we're working inside the business to return to a faster talent acquisition model. And therefore, look to accelerate the growth in that business where the demand we believe is still there and still very robust.Our commercial business, we called it flat for the year. It was flat for the year. And I think inside of that are some turbulence and variability in our Middle East business and more robustness in our U.S. commercial business. And I think the prospects especially for our cyber-centric business in the U.S. and around the world are excellent. We probably will still see some spottiness and variability in other products. But overall, I am optimistic for our commercial business as we look forward.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much. And then a quick one for you, Lloyd. So the $6 million EBITDA per month, that's basically like close to 100 bps on the margin year-over-year. My understanding from other contractors is that the CARES Act did not reimburse for costs incurred prior to its passage, but was expected to reimburse for costs afterwards. Could you give us some color on what's in the $6 million? And where are we with what the act actually says? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Essentially as we said in our prepared remarks, it's really complying with the CARES Act and our inability to invoice for fee. Now, that being said, we're constantly in conversations with our clients. We are optimistic that this is a temporary dynamic, but we thought it was appropriate certainly in terms of the FY '21 guidance to do our best to take that into account. As Horacio said, we've got some unknowns and this is one of them. But we've provided a range that we think acknowledges the possibility that at some point in the future, the government will begin to pay on those invoices.\nCai von Rumohr: So have you assumed it goes to the entire year or not?\nLloyd Howell: As I said earlier, we did our best to include it as part of the year. But we feel that looking out 12 months, there could be the potential for that to turn in the other direction.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Caso: Good morning. I was wondering if you could update us on your optionality efforts. What have you seen -- what have you been able to capture so far? And again, remind us how you hope to capture them either through sales or annuity streams? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure, Ed. I'll start. As you know, at this point, we are focused on four distinct initiatives inside of our portfolio that are the largest and then a number of things that we're building behind that. And the four are Modzy, which is our artificial intelligence platform and marketplace; our directed energy efforts; recreation.gov; and our District Defend secure mobility technology. And in each one of those we have a distinct business plan. They are different by nature and so they each monetize differently. But what they have in common is that they are all not directly labor based, and so they create value. First of all, they create higher margins and they create value outside of having to add headcount. And we're seeing good progress frankly in all four. It\u2019s probably more than the time that we have to take you through the details on each one of them. But I am both pleased and optimistic they're all hitting their milestones. They're all on plan at this point, the revenues, the profits are not material to the overall operation. We didn't expect them to be at this point, but they're very much on track. And my hope is the future is very bright.\nEdward Caso: And my other question, there seems to be a drift higher in cost plus revenue and a drift down with fixed price revenue. Presumably that's having some impact on your margins and do you see that trend continuing and acting as a headwind going forward?\nLloyd Howell: We see the uptick in cost reimbursable largely due to the growth in our defense business where more times than not that's the contract site that's applied. That being said, Ed, within our performance, both cost reimbursable and time, materials, we have been able to execute in a manner that has maintained if not grown margin a little bit. The downtick in fixed price is really from our vantage point a timing and clients\u2019 preference. And we don't get too excited if there's a couple of percentage point decrement or increase in that. However, we continue to scale up our higher margin capabilities as we always have said. We're operating even more effectively year-over-year. And we're not experiencing as many self-inflicted missteps as we have in the past. And so for \u201820, it was really the COVID related impact that brought it down a bit.\nHoracio Rozanski: If you\u2019ll allow me, let me put this in the context of the overall investment thesis because I think it's important to just frame the all together. If you remember, we -- over the theory of the three year period that would end at the end of this year, if we actually meet our guidance for the year, we'll have added roughly $2 billion in new revenue, almost all of it organic. Our margins will have gone from, Lloyd, check me here, the low 9s, 10% or the low 10s. And then we would be looking at an ADEPS growth over a three year period in the 70% to 80%. So we've been able to do all of that while continuing to invest for the future, while continuing to drive the business, while continue to drive our margins. And the inside of that, like Lloyd pointed out, what's happening to the different piece parts of the business and even to the contract structure has in no way in an impediment. In fact, we're actually extraordinarily pleased with the performance of the contracts.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatt Akers: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about kind of the timing of when people can return to some of these secured facilities that they may not be able to access now. Has that started to happen at all, with some of these states kind of easing lockdowns or how should we think of sort of the timing of that?\nHoracio Rozanski: So let me try and frame it. First of all, on some of our critical facilities, our people continue to go. They were on the frontlines. The work that we're doing could not be stopped and could not be brought into telework. And they've done an amazing job of continuing to be there, support our clients. I couldn't be prouder of them, and frankly, of our clients, because our clients have acted with a great deal of responsibility, discipline and diligence. And as a result of that, we've been able to have people at these critical facilities while keeping everybody safe. As we look forward, we anticipate and are beginning to see more requirements for people to go in. It's not a huge amount yet and it may not be. Our goal is to maximize telework because we know telework works for the vast majority of what we do. And we expect it to continue. Every time we send people back to a client facility because the mission requires it, we do it in consultation with the clients and in while building one of these safe return plans that addresses all of the things we talked about before to make sure that our people and our clients are safe as possible, while we do this.I think it\u2019s people-centric approach that we've taken, that our clients have taken is really the right way to go and it will meet the need to bring people back in a way that is responsible for the needs of the mission and the safety of the people. And I think, again, as I said before, executing against this plan is our top priority.\nMatt Akers: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess, just a follow-up. So you had talked about, maybe at some point in the next year issuing like kind of the next stage of long-term guidance. Obviously a lot of uncertainty with COVID and the election and potentially budget pressures, as you called out in prepared remarks. I mean should we still think about that as sort of coming up in the near term future? Or when do you think of sort of framing that for us?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure, I'll start. I know Lloyd has a lot to say on this topic, too. This is an area that's near and dear to our hearts. I think having clear strategic guidance both internally and externally is important and we have been working on a strategic review that is ongoing. At the right time, probably, certainly in the next 12 months, we will look forward to trying to give both strategic -- clarify our internal strategic changes, if any, and give strategic guidance externally and the associated financials that go with that. I think, again, it's done against the backdrop of an investment thesis for the last three years and we still have to deliver on the last year and we're obviously very focused on that, has been very successful. And we have to stay adaptive and we have to be able to incorporate, as we always do, everything that we learn in the environment as part of our plans and as part of our strategy.\nLloyd Howell: And not much more to build upon. I was looking forward to getting out with our new or updated investment thesis in the fall, at the latest, end of the calendar, then the pandemic hit. So we had to obviously do a bit of a reset there. But as Horacio said, we hope to be in a position shortly after the New Year, post the election to get back to everyone with what the update would be.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, good morning. Lloyd, I wanted to start with you on the cash flows. So, with the 550 delivered in fiscal '20, your guide is for flat two plus 50. I thought I\u2019d just ask about the puts and takes around that spread?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Well, first of all we're very pleased with our consistent ability to collect cash and largely, as you listen to these calls, this has been a journey. We put in place a variety of operational changes, improved our relationship with the payment offices, as well as balance that out on the payable side. The increase in our guidance, we're very pleased and happy to do that. The puts and takes really are around the unknowns that you heard in our prepared remarks as to what as the pandemic unfolds might be the impact on the virtual processes that are working now. And in the first half, to the best of our ability we\u2019ve got more clarity in the second half. So the cyclicality we don\u2019t expect to change. We remain confident that we've got sustainable changes in place. But as we've done in the past, if we see that we are doing better, we'll advise everyone to that and make adjustments accordingly.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then Horacio, just a couple of quick things. First on the telework. You've talked about how effective it's been for you. And we've all seen that. What do you think about the customer? Do you think that there's an opportunity one for the customer, DoD specifically, to increase telework as this -- post crisis? And is there an opportunity for you in there?And then the other question I wanted to ask you was on your book-to-bill. Here in the first half, do you see a similar trend as the last couple of years something like a -- let's call it a 2.0 book-to-bill for the first fiscal half?\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me take the first part. I think Lloyd will want to thank the second part. We wouldn't have been able to move to this level of telework if it weren't for the fact that our clients have both encouraged and allowed it and worked right alongside with us. And I think we're all learning. We have for example learned to write these very large proposals entirely virtually. This is not something six months ago, we could have told you we could do.And I think our clients are learning too about both some of the opportunities and the limitations of these new platforms. And I think this whole thing is changing people's minds. I see in that an opportunity to do more remote delivery, which would be both more efficient and more effective to our clients. It would require people to move less often. It would have -- make different talent accessible to our clients. And our clients see that too. And so, I look forward to working with them to try and enable as much of that as humanly possible.On the book to bill front, I know Lloyd want to talk about the numbers. So all I can say is demand for what we do fortunately continues to be very robust, and we see a lot of opportunities and we're writing proposals at an accelerated pace and again in the context of what's going on around us we -- I am very optimistic and pleased with the performance so far.\nLloyd Howell: That\u2019s really correct. Let me point you to a couple of indications or indicators that give us the optimism. One is that our qualified pipeline is up 31% year-over-year. We're seeing recompetes up 17% and the new work opportunities indicative of the JAIC win have also increased the about $1.6 billion. Now \u201820 was a lighter year in terms of recompetes but we're expecting an uptick in that in FY \u201821. I think it's a bit premature to talk about specific numbers, but it's safe to say that we expect the seasonal pattern of book-to-bill to be largely on the same curve.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Just wondering about the budget remarks that you made early in the call. When we think about what the risks are and the puts and takes there in the second half of year, is it really about whether there's a fiscal \u201821 budget passed on time? Or are there other specific things that you think would affect your fiscal \u201821?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think at this point we mostly want to acknowledge the potential volatility in the budget discussions. We're under a two year budget deal but the reality is that there's been an unprecedented number of things that are happening as we speak in the response to COVID and we aren't sure how that all is going to -- how it\u2019s going to go. Having said that, I go back to the point that we feel very good about the demand signals that we're getting from our clients for the things that we do, that we have been as mission-centric as we know how to be because we believe that is a more resilient part of the market. And I think if we demonstrate it even with this early approach, this crisis, we can respond very quickly to changes in market signal and marketing environment. And so, that's how we see the second half of our year playing out.\nLloyd Howell: I would just add that across all of our metrics we're expecting to deliver a very strong FY \u201821 coupled with a strong balance sheet that we see as a strategic asset. The budget is just one of several variables that are influencing our guidance. On the supply side, of the pandemic impact in terms of our people, future use or not use of PTO, shift work arrangements and collaboration with our clients. All of that are also variables that influence our guidance.\nSeth Seifman: And one quick follow-up. I know this can be difficult at times given the high percentage of classified work, but you\u2019ve mentioned going after additional large opportunities. You've also mentioned more recompete this year. On either side, is there anything specific that you can call out in terms of opportunities so we should be watching for?\nLloyd Howell: Not at this time. I just pointed to on a recompete basis, win rate increased 7% to 90, which is getting back to our historical performance. And on the new business side, we've got a win rate of 61%. So that coupled with our differentiation, our client relationships, and our workforce, we are poised to have another solid year.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you. And thank you all for your questions and for a very robust discussion this morning. If you'll allow me I'd like to close today once again saying thank you to the people of Booz Allen, to our clients and to our investors and analysts. It's because of all of you that Booz Allen can continue to strive for excellence. And we can lean forward as an institution that can do the right thing both for the short-term, and especially for the long-term. So thanks again, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. I hope that you, your families and your colleagues have been healthy and safe since we last spoke. It's been eight weeks since we Booz Allen's fiscal year 2020 ended. But March feels like a distant memory, given all that has transpired since then. Our world, our communities, and our institutions have taken drastic, necessary steps to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its toll has been unlike anything most of us have ever experienced in terms of illness, lives lost and economic hardship. Well, first responders, doctors and nurses and all essential workers have inspired us with their actions. From everyone at Booz Allen, our heartfelt condolences to those who have lost loved ones and our deepest gratitude to every single person on the frontlines and to their families.Without a doubt, the worldwide mobilization against COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way we live and work. And so, this morning I will begin by discussing Booz Allen's response and approach going forward. Then Lloyd will build on these themes, while providing the details of our fiscal year 2020 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2021.Reflecting back to early February, when COVID-19 began spreading across the globe, our firm immediately organized a crisis response team and committed to three overriding priorities: First and foremost, to protect the health and safety of our people, their families and our communities; Second, to continue supporting the critical missions of our clients; And third, to ensure the financial and institutional resilience of our firm.These priorities have guided every decision since then, including our move to mandatory telework on March 17th. They were also at the center of our resilience program, announced on April 1st. We took bold action, creating a $100 million pandemic resilience fund, by containing and reprioritizing non-personnel costs. Using those funds to increase job security and expand benefits, we believe could relieve the initial stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic and help the most vulnerable in our communities. This in turn, will allow our people to channel their talent and energy into meeting the needs of our clients, an outcome that directly contributes to Booz Allen's growth while preserving our resiliency. I am proud of how well the Booz Allen's team responded early in this crisis and how quickly and effectively it adapted to a new reality.As we continue to learn about the virus and adjust our operations, we think about COVID-19 in three distinct phases. The first phase encompasses the crisis response I just described. And it's now behind us, roughly from the end of January through the end of April. We are now in the early weeks of a second phase, which is likely to last many months. It is characterized by a continued threat from the virus with no proven treatment or vaccine in place. Decisions for health -- Allen's public health and economic considerations largely will be made locally and at varying levels inside different institutions and organizations. The third and final phase will begin when the virus is controlled by some combination of treatments, vaccines and immunity. We ultimately expect a new normal to emerge, incorporating lasting social changes that result from the pandemic. As a business, we view this as a source of new challenges and opportunities that need to be considered and anticipated starting now.Because phase two will encompass much of fiscal year 2021, I want to summarize key decisions we've made about how we will manage through it. The health and safety of the total workforce remains our top priority. This includes not only our own people, but also those we work with every day. We have already begun talking with clients about our approach, which we are calling safe return.During this phase, we will continue to maximize telework. Our experience to-date has shown that not only does remote work reduce the spread of infection and incidence of disease, it is also highly effective. Across our firm, teams are delivering against contracts, advancing missions, hiring talent, capturing work, innovating and collaborating all via telework.We also recognize that in some cases, particularly with classified missions, there are very few options for telework where its effectiveness is limited. In these cases, we have and we'll continue to work with clients to ensure a safe return to their facilities. Guided by federal, state and local policies, as well as advice from our own experts, we are creating safe return plans in collaboration with each client. These plans consider things like social distancing rules, travel restrictions, cleaning procedures, and protections for those at high risk. Great execution of these safe return plans we believe will help keep everyone healthy and safe while maintaining critical missions. As part of phase two, we are piloting antibody testing protocols, conducting contact tracing, and fine tuning our employee benefit programs.And much like in phase one, we are managing costs, so we can execute the mitigation strategies that prove most effective. This is a complex but critical undertaking, and we are all hands on deck. Looking further down the road, after the virus is controlled and the pandemic is over, society and therefore Booz Allen will not completely go back to how things were prior to COVID-19. We are already seeing emerging themes, such as faster adoption of telehealth, virtual learning, and secure mobility solutions, for example. These changes are beginning to reshape demand. And since Booz Allen doesn't ever stand still, we're already tilting in those directions as we develop our next growth strategy.Turning now to the financials and to our current operations, it is important to underscore that we were able to quickly respond to the challenges of COVID-19 because of our talented team, and strong financial footing. Fiscal year 2020 was another outstanding year for Booz Allen. Once again, we met all of our financial objectives while serving clients with passion and dedication. Because so much of our work is mission-critical, it must continue without interruption. And the key strategic trend that fuels our business has not changed. The demand for integrated technology solutions continues to grow.Since the health emergency began, we've been in constant communication with our clients. And like all of us, they're grappling with unprecedented changes and have rallied to maintain missions in a whole new environment. Many are turning to us for support of new requirements related specifically to the government's COVID-19 response. Today, we are operating at pre-pandemic productivity levels, what I credit to our teams and our clients. In fact, about 90% of our billable work is being delivered via telework. And roughly 10% of our people who are still going into critical facilities are supported by specific plans developed in partnership with our clients to maximize everyone's safety.Our leaders are managing the business with agility, hiring against more than 1,000 sold and funded positions, aggressively pursuing new work and realigning people and resources to the areas of greatest need and opportunity.As I said many times before, this is the advantage of our business model. Our single P&L allows us to operate as one team. Throughout any crisis or disruptions, we are in it together.In sum, the management team is very pleased with how the business has adjusted to the demands of today's environment. We have entered fiscal year 2021 with confidence and momentum. We expect to deliver another year of industry-leading organic revenue growth and strong cash generation. This will allow us to continue investing in people and technologies, exploring option value opportunities for the future and delivering value to our shareholders.Given the complexity of the environment, we expect to have a strong first half, with more uncertainty in the second half. The uncertainty stems from several unknowns, including the course of the pandemic and its possible effect on our workforce and the outlook for the budget beyond the current government fiscal year. Despite the uncertainty, we are pleased to once again increase our expectations for ADEPS growth in our investment thesis. You'll recall that the thesis originally envisioned 50% ADEPS growth over a three year period from the end of fiscal year 2018 to the end of the fiscal year 2021. Last year, we increased the goal to 66% ADEPS growth over that period. The FY '21 ADEPS guidance range we are announcing today translates to 70% to 80% cumulative ADEPS growth from the end of fiscal year 2018 to the end of the fiscal year 2021.The people of Booz Allen deserve all the credit for the growth we've achieved and for sustaining our unique position in the market. Their hard work and the financial results they've produced are the best proof points of our firm's fundamental strength and resilience.Lloyd, over to you for the details of the full year and our guidance for fiscal year 2021. Thanks, Lloyd. The past three months have been incredibly challenging for our firm, our clients and our country. What stands out for me though is how individuals have rallied to support each other and to carry the burdens together. I'm incredibly proud of how the people of Booz Allen have responded at work and in our communities. From making personal donations that supplement our corporate contributions to food banks, first responders and military families in need, to volunteering with local charities and making face masks for colleagues, we're showing the best of Booz Allen. It shines through in their work as well. Allow me to give you just a few examples.One of our associates Sarvesh Nalluri is the heart and brain behind the data visualization project that is helping the Veterans Health Administration prepare for a possible surge of the virus in rural areas. One of our epidemiologists, Dr. Sumiko Mekaru worked on her own time with other scientists and researchers to build an openly available global COVID-19 pandemic map. She is now creating models and dashboards that will help leaders at the DoD and Defense Health Agency maintain readiness. And elsewhere in the Department of Defense, we have a team that worked around the clock for six days to move critical pre-deployment training of soldiers that is usually done in person to a completely virtual environment. Since the beginning of April, about 3,000 soldiers have received this live virtual instruction, a mandatory course that helps keep them safe while deployed.And finally, because May is Military Appreciation Month, I'll mention [Monique DiChiara] a cyber security analyst from our office in Lexington, Massachusetts. [Monique], like many others at our firm, is a member of the National Guard. She was recently activated to assist with the COVID-19 response, and led a contact tracing mission for her unit. We are so proud of her service to our country and are delighted to have her back. These and many other individual stories demonstrate the values, hard work and dedication of this firm. We're a company that mobilizes to meet any challenge or opportunity. Over the past three months, our mantra has been in it together. It conveys unity for sure. But more importantly, it underscores our institutional strength and resilience, the very things that create value for our investors and all stakeholders.So I'll close with a big thank you to the people of Booz Allen. You amaze me and inspire me each day. It is my distinct privilege to represent your work on these goals each quarter.With that Nick, let's open the line for questions. Sure. Good morning, Sheila. And thanks for the question. We're obviously very pleased to have been awarded this contract. It was part of the competition and we're just very glad. As I always say on the calls the size of these contracts or task orders is important. But for me equally important is the actual content and the strategic value that they create. And in this particular case, this is an opportunity to support the JAIC, as they accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence broadly across DoD and obviously it's a mission that's near to my heart and to the people of Booz Allen, and we care about it deeply. More broadly, I think it's another proof point of our strategy as the leading provider of technology solutions to our clients. And it demonstrates that our strategy works. Artificial intelligence in general is a great example because it's both an opportunity to grow a workforce in our traditional business that scales around these new technologies and to create option value in this case with our multi-program. So all-in-all, very, very pleased and we look forward to more. I think when you look -- like you got to put things in context. Right now, it's all about the response. Our clients are very focused on that understandably. They're leveraging both existing technologies and new technologies as rapidly as possible. I think as you look forward, the need that is clear, especially when you operate at the scale of our clients, is the need to have all of this information from these disparate sources fused together, available and ready for decision making almost instantaneously. And in my view, artificial intelligence is going to be part and parcel of that. It's going to be a big deal. And that's why I'm so happy that we're both doing this work. But more importantly, we're also setting up the foundations for creating unified data environments and a lot of the things are going to be required to make this real in the long run. I think it's first of all too soon to tell exactly how it's going to evolve, right? I mean we're still in the midst of a response effort. As I mentioned before, we're going into what we view as a second phase and more prolonged phase. That is going to require a lot of rethinking of how things work. And then in the third phase, once hopefully this virus is behind us, there's going to be changes that are left, that we're beginning to see. I mentioned before things like the increased adoption of telehealth, the need for secure mobility, virtual reality training. All of these things are -- they were in the works already. What we're seeing is an acceleration in need and in desire to deploy these technologies. And we are positioned to help. This has been -- from the beginning of Vision 2020 -- 2012 this has been our mantra, is we want to be at the center of our clients' mission bringing technology to solve new problems. And again, we're seeing demand across the enterprise from intelligence to defense, to certainly our health and civil business that relates to all of this. Again I want to qualify this by saying we are in the midst of a rapidly changing situation and everything around us is changing. The thing that seems to be clear to us is, this needs to accelerate implementation of technology to respond to the environmental factors is, if anything, accelerating. Telehealth has become a necessity, not just a technology that is in its infancy, but a technology that is being broadly adopted. How to do that, how to do that securely, the changes that, that poses to the handling and management of the information that is provided and how all of that happens is going to have lasting effects on the requirements to continue to drive that technology.On secure mobility, everybody is working from home. That creates entire new attack surfaces and tremendous opportunities for efficiency, for effectiveness, for resiliency. And we're right in the middle of thinking through that for our own organization and helping our clients. This is a place where we're hopeful that if technology like this will defend, which we've been investing in, as you know, for several years, will come to the forefront and be very helpful.And then in terms of virtual training, again, this is a trend that was already playing out, that is accelerating, and one where we have over the years invested significantly to be very relevant to our clients, especially as we were doing [ID] response and things like that. We saw a new generation, war fighters coming in that would be more willing to learn from gamified technologies to learn from virtual reality. We have a network of labs that we've created to support that. And again, as all of this evolves, where we will see increases in demand. How that will change within a -- any timeframe based on budget priorities? As Lloyd pointed out, as I pointed out, there's some level of uncertainty around that. But what I will quote you to as it relates to us is our ability to evolve and move rapidly from one opportunity to another because of the single P&L, because of our culture, we just respond quickly to ideas. We invest in things that make sense for long-term and hopefully that makes us build to last. Cai, good morning. I'll start and I'm sure Lloyd will -- want to add. First of all, the overall results as you know are quite good. Defense and civil are up to the tune of about 15% on the year which is slightly ahead of our expectations and we're extremely happy with that. We've been talking for the last couple of calls about the fact that our intel business was not adding people as quickly as it needed to. And we made some changes to accelerate that. And I think what you're seeing is a continuation of that trend. And while at the same time we're working inside the business to return to a faster talent acquisition model. And therefore, look to accelerate the growth in that business where the demand we believe is still there and still very robust.Our commercial business, we called it flat for the year. It was flat for the year. And I think inside of that are some turbulence and variability in our Middle East business and more robustness in our U.S. commercial business. And I think the prospects especially for our cyber-centric business in the U.S. and around the world are excellent. We probably will still see some spottiness and variability in other products. But overall, I am optimistic for our commercial business as we look forward. Sure, Ed. I'll start. As you know, at this point, we are focused on four distinct initiatives inside of our portfolio that are the largest and then a number of things that we're building behind that. And the four are Modzy, which is our artificial intelligence platform and marketplace; our directed energy efforts; recreation.gov; and our District Defend secure mobility technology. And in each one of those we have a distinct business plan. They are different by nature and so they each monetize differently. But what they have in common is that they are all not directly labor based, and so they create value. First of all, they create higher margins and they create value outside of having to add headcount. And we're seeing good progress frankly in all four. It's probably more than the time that we have to take you through the details on each one of them. But I am both pleased and optimistic they're all hitting their milestones. They're all on plan at this point, the revenues, the profits are not material to the overall operation. We didn't expect them to be at this point, but they're very much on track. And my hope is the future is very bright. If you'll allow me, let me put this in the context of the overall investment thesis because I think it's important to just frame the all together. If you remember, we -- over the theory of the three year period that would end at the end of this year, if we actually meet our guidance for the year, we'll have added roughly $2 billion in new revenue, almost all of it organic. Our margins will have gone from, Lloyd, check me here, the low 9s, 10% or the low 10s. And then we would be looking at an ADEPS growth over a three year period in the 70% to 80%. So we've been able to do all of that while continuing to invest for the future, while continuing to drive the business, while continue to drive our margins. And the inside of that, like Lloyd pointed out, what's happening to the different piece parts of the business and even to the contract structure has in no way in an impediment. In fact, we're actually extraordinarily pleased with the performance of the contracts. So let me try and frame it. First of all, on some of our critical facilities, our people continue to go. They were on the frontlines. The work that we're doing could not be stopped and could not be brought into telework. And they've done an amazing job of continuing to be there, support our clients. I couldn't be prouder of them, and frankly, of our clients, because our clients have acted with a great deal of responsibility, discipline and diligence. And as a result of that, we've been able to have people at these critical facilities while keeping everybody safe. As we look forward, we anticipate and are beginning to see more requirements for people to go in. It's not a huge amount yet and it may not be. Our goal is to maximize telework because we know telework works for the vast majority of what we do. And we expect it to continue. Every time we send people back to a client facility because the mission requires it, we do it in consultation with the clients and in while building one of these safe return plans that addresses all of the things we talked about before to make sure that our people and our clients are safe as possible, while we do this.I think it's people-centric approach that we've taken, that our clients have taken is really the right way to go and it will meet the need to bring people back in a way that is responsible for the needs of the mission and the safety of the people. And I think, again, as I said before, executing against this plan is our top priority. Sure, I'll start. I know Lloyd has a lot to say on this topic, too. This is an area that's near and dear to our hearts. I think having clear strategic guidance both internally and externally is important and we have been working on a strategic review that is ongoing. At the right time, probably, certainly in the next 12 months, we will look forward to trying to give both strategic -- clarify our internal strategic changes, if any, and give strategic guidance externally and the associated financials that go with that. I think, again, it's done against the backdrop of an investment thesis for the last three years and we still have to deliver on the last year and we're obviously very focused on that, has been very successful. And we have to stay adaptive and we have to be able to incorporate, as we always do, everything that we learn in the environment as part of our plans and as part of our strategy. Let me take the first part. I think Lloyd will want to thank the second part. We wouldn't have been able to move to this level of telework if it weren't for the fact that our clients have both encouraged and allowed it and worked right alongside with us. And I think we're all learning. We have for example learned to write these very large proposals entirely virtually. This is not something six months ago, we could have told you we could do.And I think our clients are learning too about both some of the opportunities and the limitations of these new platforms. And I think this whole thing is changing people's minds. I see in that an opportunity to do more remote delivery, which would be both more efficient and more effective to our clients. It would require people to move less often. It would have -- make different talent accessible to our clients. And our clients see that too. And so, I look forward to working with them to try and enable as much of that as humanly possible.On the book to bill front, I know Lloyd want to talk about the numbers. So all I can say is demand for what we do fortunately continues to be very robust, and we see a lot of opportunities and we're writing proposals at an accelerated pace and again in the context of what's going on around us we -- I am very optimistic and pleased with the performance so far. I think at this point we mostly want to acknowledge the potential volatility in the budget discussions. We're under a two year budget deal but the reality is that there's been an unprecedented number of things that are happening as we speak in the response to COVID and we aren't sure how that all is going to -- how it's going to go. Having said that, I go back to the point that we feel very good about the demand signals that we're getting from our clients for the things that we do, that we have been as mission-centric as we know how to be because we believe that is a more resilient part of the market. And I think if we demonstrate it even with this early approach, this crisis, we can respond very quickly to changes in market signal and marketing environment. And so, that's how we see the second half of our year playing out. Thank you. And thank you all for your questions and for a very robust discussion this morning. If you'll allow me I'd like to close today once again saying thank you to the people of Booz Allen, to our clients and to our investors and analysts. It's because of all of you that Booz Allen can continue to strive for excellence. And we can lean forward as an institution that can do the right thing both for the short-term, and especially for the long-term. So thanks again, and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by echoing your comment about our excellent operational and financial performance in recent years. This track record has positioned Booz Allen to not simply react to the challenges of this pandemic, but to proactively address the key opportunities and risks that emerge from it. We are managing the business to ensure long-term strength just as we have done in the past with things like budget sequestrations and government shutdowns.We are investing in our people and allocating our resources efficiently as we strive to continue generating industry-leading organic revenue growth. Importantly, and as Horacio mentioned, our strength of execution has again supported an increase in the three year ADEPS growth target in our investment thesis. I will discuss this in more detail when I cover fiscal year 2021 guidance, but first I will provide an overview of our fiscal year 2020 results while highlighting the expected performance impacts of COVID-19.Our fiscal year 2020 results are shown on Slide 6. At the top-line, revenue increased 11.3% to $7.5 billion while revenue excluding billable expenses grew 9.9% to $5.2 billion. This double-digit organic growth was the result of both sustained demand for our services and solutions, and an increase in headcount to meet that demand.Turning to Slide 7, our fourth quarter book-to-bill was 0.4 times which is somewhat lower than what is typical for our Q4. As I noted during the earnings call last quarter, we are building on our strong foundation of diversified small awards by pursuing larger, more technically complex bids. This has naturally increased the volatility of our book-to-bill metrics. Nonetheless, we have entered fiscal year 2021 with enough client demand to continue growing in line with our investment thesis targets.Demand for our services and solutions remains healthy, particularly in defense and civil markets. Win rates in fiscal year 2020 were up in our qualified pipeline which includes several large new and recompete opportunities increased 31% compared to year ago levels. COVID-19 has not to-date saw significant delays in awards. Our full fiscal year book-to-bill in 2020 was 1.2 times. Total backlog grew 7% yielding our largest ever fiscal year-end backlog of $20.7 billion. Funded backlog was down 1% to $3.4 billion. Unfunded backlog was up 23% at $4.5 billion and priced options increased 5% to $12.8 billion.Pivoting to headcount, as of March 31st, we had 27,173 employees, up by 1,104 year-over-year or 4.2%. This was below our 5% headcount growth target for the year, but the revenue impact was more than offset by higher employee salaries as we continued to hire and retain talent with in demand skill sets COVID-19 has already transformed the labor market. And I am pleased with how well our recruiting efforts have transitioned to the virtual environment. And while hiring has slowed due to the pandemic, our attrition thus far has dropped by roughly half. As such, early signs point to continued headcount growth. We believe the positive hiring and retention trends we're seeing in the early weeks of this fiscal year demonstrates the wisdom of the resilience program we put in place on April 1st.Moving to the bottom-line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2020 was $754 million, up 11.8% from the previous year. This increase was driven primarily by our top-line growth, strong contract-level performance, and solid operational management. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 10.1%. This was in line with our expectations, even with an approximately $10 million end of year negative impact to EBITDA associated with COVID-19. These costs are related to transitional expenses, temporary reductions in billability in March and charges in the intelligence market we believe we may not be able to recover.On this last point, I am pleased with how well we have worked in partnership with our defense and intelligence clients, where classified work is concentrated to retain continuity of service and ensure a ready workforce. This is a challenging situation and we appreciate that the CARES Act recognize the need to keep this critical workforce ready and available. Invoicing under the terms of that law has begun and current guidance suggests that fee will need be reimbursed on certain contracts involving shift work. This affects all companies in our industry. We estimate that while temporary, it will have an impact of approximately $6 million in lost EBITDA per month. Full year 2020 net income and ADEPS also grew significantly.Net income grew 15% year-over-year to $483 million. Adjusted net income was $449 million, up 14% from fiscal year 2019. Diluted earnings per share rose to $3.41 from $2.91 in the prior year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased to $3.18 from $2.76 in the prior year. These increases were primarily driven by revenue growth, profitability improvement, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count in fiscal year 2020, due to our share repurchase program.Regarding our effective tax rate, during Q4, we adopted an alternative approach to identifying qualified expenditures for our research and development tax credits mentioned last quarter. As a result, we recognized approximately $38 million in tax credits this quarter net of reserves, which we excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect this method to provide additional credits in the future. And we have included the expected benefits in our guidance for effective tax rate.Turning to cash, we generated $551 million in operating cash during the fiscal year, representing 10% growth over fiscal year 2019 and putting us at the top of our forecasted range. Our strong operating cash flow, fourth quarter revolver draw and the delayed draw term loan A execution at the start of the fiscal year allowed us to end the year with $742 million in cash on hand. So far, we have not experienced material delays in cash collections due to COVID-19. The virtual invoicing practice has run smoothly due to the ongoing efforts of our team and our government partners. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020 totaled $128 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology.So, I'll address forward-looking CapEx spend in the guidance section. At this point, the long-term impact of COVID-19 on facility spend is unclear. However, this is an area where we see opportunity as we adopt new ways of working. On and off, our operating performance and prudent capital management have resulted in a strong, well capitalized balance sheet. This is particularly useful in these turbulent times, as it provides tremendous strategic and operational flexibility.Please turn to Slide 8. During the fourth quarter, we continued to execute on a prudent capital allocation strategy designed to deliver both near and long-term shareholder value. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $156 million worth of shares. For the year, we repurchased a total of 2.7 million shares at an average price of $69 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $333 million to shareholders during fiscal year 2020, bringing total capital deployment through the first two years of our investment thesis to nearly $700 million.Looking forward, we are reiterating our $1.4 billion capital deployment target through fiscal year 2021, a key part of our investment thesis. Our priorities remain: reinvesting in our business, securing our quarterly dividends, appropriately price strategic M&A, and share repurchases and special dividends.Today, we are also announcing that the company has authorized a regular dividend of $0.31 per share payable on June 30th to stockholders of record on June 15th. Dividends remain an important component of our strategy to create value for shareholders. And we are extremely proud of the growth in our quarterly dividends, which amounts to a robust 30% growth rate for fiscal year 2020. This reflects the confidence our management has in the business and its future potential, and demonstrates our commitment to the targeted 2% yield in our investment thesis.Turning to guidance, please move to Slide 9. Last year, at this time, due to an uncertain federal budget environment, Horacio and I characterized our plan for fiscal year 2020 in two parts: an aggressive first half, followed by a more conservative second half. Today, we are operating in an unprecedented environment. And I'll characterize our guidance in a similar way.We are actively managing through the early phases of the pandemic. As Horacio described, our team and our government partners have rapidly adapted so that our nation's critical missions continue without disruption. This early success under extraordinary circumstances, plus our strong underlying fundamentals allow us to carry momentum into the first half. We remain in a growth posture, but acknowledge that there is reduced visibility into the factors that will drive performance for the full year. As Horacio noted, the second half of our fiscal year could be impacted by unknowns and related factors. These include the course of the pandemic, whether use the paid time-off returns to more typical patterns around the summer vacations, the timing and extent of our return to secured workspaces, the status of appropriations after September 30th and a possible post-election reordering of budget priorities.As a result of these uncertainties, our guidance ranges to begin the year are slightly broader than in recent years. Our fiscal year 2021 guidance is as follows.We expect revenue to grow between 6% and 10% with growth in revenue excluding billable expenses expected to be in the same range. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to be approximately 10%, on par with fiscal year 2020. This margin guidance incorporates uncertain fee recovery on work invoiced per the CARES Act.At the bottom line, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.40 and $3.60. This guidance is based on 136 million to 140 million weighted averages outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. We expect to generate $550 million to $600 million in operating cash, which again to this point has not been materially impacted by COVID-19. And finally, we are forecasting CapEx of approximately $80 million to $100 million. We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology, including a supportive move towards telework. To be clear, facility spend in the near term will decrease given the current environment, while our long-term strategy is still being developed as we contemplate a safe return.In closing, we are extremely proud of our fiscal year 2020 performance and pleased to be forecasting another year of robust results. Booz Allen remains on a clear and strong path delivering exceptional financial results while investing for the future. We have built significant momentum in the business and our people are as engaged and focused on our clients' missions as ever. And finally, even amidst uncertainties, the entire management team is optimistic about the year and confident that our firm can make a difference in unprecedented times.Horacio, back to you. Sure, good morning, Carter. As you know more and more of our work has been transitioning to the -- in area of -- technically advanced areas like software related engineering. So we had an opportunity to look at that. With our analysis that we mentioned last quarter, we reassessed our tax credits associated with our R&D expenditures going back to 2016 through 2019, and that yielded a net tax benefit of $38 million and -- recorded in the fourth quarter and excluded from ADEPS.Now going forward, it's, early to tell exactly what any changes there'd be and the impact on it, but we expect our effective tax rate as we indicated in our guidance to be between 20% and 23% in FY \u201821. And beyond that, depending upon, the IRS' ruling to be in that range if not slightly below that given the reserve amount we made. Sure. Jon, let me first recognize that we had exceptional performance in FY \u201820 Q1 through Q3, which really allowed us to allocate the resources in Q4, not only to Horacio's point and improve upon our competitive positioning but also maintain the business momentum. And we see that and we're very pleased with that performance, despite the $10 million EBITDA COVID-related impact.Going forward, we still expect our portfolio to perform as it did in FY \u201820 and we're operating very well at the business and contract level. We feel our strategy is working. And we do have what we believe is a temporary headwind on the inability to collect fee in our -- some of our security and defense businesses. But we've taken that into account with our FY \u201821 guidance. And that's why we're affirming 10% EBITDA margins. Sure. Essentially as we said in our prepared remarks, it's really complying with the CARES Act and our inability to invoice for fee. Now, that being said, we're constantly in conversations with our clients. We are optimistic that this is a temporary dynamic, but we thought it was appropriate certainly in terms of the FY '21 guidance to do our best to take that into account. As Horacio said, we've got some unknowns and this is one of them. But we've provided a range that we think acknowledges the possibility that at some point in the future, the government will begin to pay on those invoices. As I said earlier, we did our best to include it as part of the year. But we feel that looking out 12 months, there could be the potential for that to turn in the other direction. We see the uptick in cost reimbursable largely due to the growth in our defense business where more times than not that's the contract site that's applied. That being said, Ed, within our performance, both cost reimbursable and time, materials, we have been able to execute in a manner that has maintained if not grown margin a little bit. The downtick in fixed price is really from our vantage point a timing and clients' preference. And we don't get too excited if there's a couple of percentage point decrement or increase in that. However, we continue to scale up our higher margin capabilities as we always have said. We're operating even more effectively year-over-year. And we're not experiencing as many self-inflicted missteps as we have in the past. And so for \u201820, it was really the COVID related impact that brought it down a bit. And not much more to build upon. I was looking forward to getting out with our new or updated investment thesis in the fall, at the latest, end of the calendar, then the pandemic hit. So we had to obviously do a bit of a reset there. But as Horacio said, we hope to be in a position shortly after the New Year, post the election to get back to everyone with what the update would be. Sure. Well, first of all we're very pleased with our consistent ability to collect cash and largely, as you listen to these calls, this has been a journey. We put in place a variety of operational changes, improved our relationship with the payment offices, as well as balance that out on the payable side. The increase in our guidance, we're very pleased and happy to do that. The puts and takes really are around the unknowns that you heard in our prepared remarks as to what as the pandemic unfolds might be the impact on the virtual processes that are working now. And in the first half, to the best of our ability we've got more clarity in the second half. So the cyclicality we don't expect to change. We remain confident that we've got sustainable changes in place. But as we've done in the past, if we see that we are doing better, we'll advise everyone to that and make adjustments accordingly. That's really correct. Let me point you to a couple of indications or indicators that give us the optimism. One is that our qualified pipeline is up 31% year-over-year. We're seeing recompetes up 17% and the new work opportunities indicative of the JAIC win have also increased the about $1.6 billion. Now \u201820 was a lighter year in terms of recompetes but we're expecting an uptick in that in FY \u201821. I think it's a bit premature to talk about specific numbers, but it's safe to say that we expect the seasonal pattern of book-to-bill to be largely on the same curve. I would just add that across all of our metrics we're expecting to deliver a very strong FY \u201821 coupled with a strong balance sheet that we see as a strategic asset. The budget is just one of several variables that are influencing our guidance. On the supply side, of the pandemic impact in terms of our people, future use or not use of PTO, shift work arrangements and collaboration with our clients. All of that are also variables that influence our guidance. Not at this time. I just pointed to on a recompete basis, win rate increased 7% to 90, which is getting back to our historical performance. And on the new business side, we've got a win rate of 61%. So that coupled with our differentiation, our client relationships, and our workforce, we are poised to have another solid year."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for question.I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Veasey.\nNick Veasey: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's third quarter 2020 earnings announcement. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We've also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on slide two.I'm Nick Veasey, Vice President of Investor Relations. And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.As shown on the disclaimer on slide three, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and, therefore, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer included in our third quarter of fiscal 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligations to update or revise the information discussed on this call.During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter of fiscal year 2020 slides.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on slide five.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Lloyd and I are very pleased to share our latest quarterly results today. As you saw in our earnings release, Booz Allen's momentum continues. Our business leaders are looking to finish the fiscal year strong and we continue to deliver the financial performance laid out in our investment thesis.At the center of our thesis is the expectation that our firm can achieve 66% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over a three-year period, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2021. This increase would be driven by a differentiated market position that produces industry-leading revenue growth, an increase in profit margin and strong cash generation that supports a value-maximizing capital deployment strategy.It is gratifying to see that our plans and expectations are coming to fruition, thanks to both the operational performance and the financial stewardship of our talented team. Because of their efforts, today we are pleased to announce another increase in our revenue and ADEPS guidance for the fiscal year, an improved outlook for operating cash and another increase in our quarterly dividend.Today, we will discuss the full details of our third quarter in the context of the full year and how fiscal year 2020 is shaping up to support the three-year goals of our investment thesis and given that this is the first earnings call of calendar year 2020, I also want to take a moment at the outset to reflect on our firm's transformation.When we launched our growth strategy eight years ago, we called it Vision 2020, but we never meant to suggest that Booz Allen's evolution would end in 2020. This strategy was about setting a bold vision for the future and then relentlessly executing against it and that is exactly what we have done.We have moved closer to the center of our clients' mission, become more technically capable, established ourselves in the innovation ecosystem and expanded our portfolio of business, including a successful reentry into the global commercial market. In parallel, we have grown and diversified our talent base, more than holding our own amid fierce competition for tech talent.We also reinvigorated our purpose and values, which has enriched our employee experience and strengthened our execution. Our firm committed to Vision 2020 during a time when federal budgets were shrinking and our core market was contracting. It was not an easy time for our industry, but we knew that if we lean forward and invested, we would be the first in the industry to return to growth. And since then, we have outpaced competitors because we remain committed to the strategy, stayed close to clients, and took advantage of one of our greatest strengths as a firm.We're always looking around the next corner to ensure that we're investing in the right capabilities and talent, so that we bring clients what they need today and in the future. This consistently creates opportunity for our business and all stakeholders in it.Today, we're positioned as the premier technology insertion company serving the federal government. This has created the conditions for our continued success and has given us the confidence to commit to multiyear financial goals that clearly demonstrate our strategy is working. It is important to understand that Vision 2020 is solely the latest evolution in our firm's 105-year history. The environment around us, the market we operate in, and the technologies we apply are constantly changing. Our job is to stay ahead of the change. We do so by keeping one foot in the present and one foot in the future.Having reached 2020, we are taking a look at everything that created our growth and momentum. We're asking, what more or different we may need to do to maintain our edge. As was true when we developed Vision 2020, we'll retain all that makes us strong, supports differentiation and drives growth, and we will no doubt do some things differently to get ahead of any challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities.As proud as I am of our success under Vision 2020, it is even more gratifying to know that, we can contemplate what's next from a position of strength. We look to the future with a lot of confidence and excitement about what it may hold for our firm, our people, our clients and investors. My overriding objective and that of our entire management team is to ensure Booz Allen continues to outperform.Let me shift now to an overview of our third quarter. Our team has delivered another quarter of exceptional performance with continued revenue and ADEPS, growth strong profitability, and excellent cash generation. The latest numbers keep us well on track for a great year, ahead in fact of where we thought we would be when we planned this fiscal year. We said, we expected a strong first half, and a relatively more conservative second half.Our third quarter hiring and book-to-bill are consistent with that pattern. The market continues to signal strong demand for our capabilities, which has fueled growth this year and a robust pipeline of future opportunities. As we noted last quarter, our growth this year has been more uneven across our business than in years past. Our defense and civil markets representing three-quarters of our portfolio are delivering double-digit revenue growth through the first nine months. Their performance is exceptional.By contrast, our intelligence business has been constrained by the need for cleared talent and a couple of re-compete losses we mentioned previously. And our global commercial business is still tracking to be roughly flat for the year. We are proactively addressing those challenges. And at the same time, we continue to take advantage of the diversity of our business portfolio and the strength of our business model. Because we operate as a single P&L, we can shift resources and talent to focus on winning the opportunities of most importance to the firm, and then delivering them with excellence.Our pipeline particularly for large jobs requiring complex technical solutions is expanding, and we have ample demand to support our objectives going forward. As we approach the final year of our thesis, we have a lot of confidence that we can meet the ambitious three-year objectives we set for ourselves.Looking at the results from the past seven quarters, what really stands out is the power of our differentiation and operating performance. Against our core investment thesis objective, 66% ADEPS growth we are ahead of pace. And the path we have used to get here relying more heavily on revenue and operating margin growth than we had anticipated means we have significant balance sheet capacity still available.We also continue to move forward with option value capabilities. These are new business lines and business models that have the potential over the long term to further fuel growth. As I said before, for more than a century, Booz Allen has succeeded by keeping one foot in the present and one foot in the future. We intend to continue our evolution and our growth, so that we deliver near and long-term value to investors and all other stakeholders.And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to take you through yet another fantastic quarter of performance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we told you that we would be executing a front-loaded plan for the full year. To ensure that, we delivered another strong performance even if there had been budget disruptions.Our leaders have executed extremely well against this plan and we carried strong momentum into the second half. Our performance through December gives us the confidence to increase our full year ADEPS revenue and operating cash flow guidance for the fiscal year and looking beyond this fiscal year, reinforces our view that we will achieve the multiyear financial goals of our investment thesis.Let's go through the numbers. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the topline, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses grew by 11.2% and 8.3% respectively compared to the third quarter last year. The increases were primarily due to delivery on sustained client demand and our continued ability to successfully hire and retain talent.Year-over-year, we delivered nearly 18% revenue growth in Defense, our largest market. Civil also delivered strong results including revenue growth of 9% compared to the prior year period.As Horacio mentioned, our intelligence business remained somewhat constrained by the challenge of finding highly cleared talent. Its revenue expanded 1% compared to the prior year period. Collectively, our portfolio of businesses is well-positioned to continue delivering industry-leading organic growth as we have done so far this fiscal year.Please turn to Slide 7. Book-to-bill for the quarter was in line with historical performance at 0.48 times and our trailing 12-month figure is 1.21 times. Going forward, we expect a slight increase in volatility in our quarterly backlog as Vision 2020 continues to enable the pursuit of larger, more complex solutions-focused work in addition to our diversified base of existing business.Total backlog as of December 31st was $22 billion, 7.4% higher than the end of the prior year period. Funded backlog at $3.5 billion decreased by 0.7%. Unfunded backlog at $5.3 billion grew 17.9% and priced options increased 5.8% to $13.1 billion. We are encouraged by these strong demand signals.Headcount during the quarter grew by about 200 to approximately 27,200 or 5.3% year-over-year. This is consistent with our 5% headcount growth target for the year. We are proud that top talent continue to be attracted to Booz Allen's unique value proposition.Moving to the bottom-line, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $191 million, up 6.2% compared with the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.3%, down 50 basis points year-over-year.As a reminder, we had an adjustment to our long-term disability plan that benefited third quarter fiscal year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margins. Our strong margin performance this quarter is in line with our multiyear expectations for margins in the low 10s and continues to be driven by strong contract performance, efficient management of our business, and an ongoing shift towards higher-margin technically focused work.Third quarter net income decreased by 15.2% to $112 million, while adjusted net income increased by 10.2% to $113 million. As a reminder, net income in the prior year benefited from the effects of tax reform. The increase in adjusted net income was driven by improvements in operational efficiency. This translated to an $0.08 increase in third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.80. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 1.5 million shares compared to a year ago.Turning to cash, we had a very strong quarter generating $100 million in operating cash. This brings our total year-to-date operating cash generation to $366 million, 29% ahead of where we were at this point last year. Due primarily to the process improvements we've made in the cash collection cycle, we anticipate strong cash conversion during our final quarter this year.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure and technology. This includes new, secure and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines and continued growth outside the Washington Metro area.Please turn to slide 8. During the quarter, we returned $61 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to deploying our targeted $1.4 billion in capital during the period from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2021, as outlined in our investment thesis. Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged and we will continue to be disciplined and patient in order to maximize near- and long-term value for our shareholders.As Horacio mentioned, our Board of Directors has authorized a $0.04 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share payable on February 28 to stockholders of record on February 14. This is the second increase in the dividend this fiscal year, illustrating the emphasis we place on quarterly dividends as a component of our strategy to create value for shareholders.Turning to the balance sheet. During the third quarter, we completed the refinancing of our term loan B. This transaction modestly reduce the cost of our term loan, while also extending its maturity out to 2026. While our strong balance sheet gives us ample capacity to meet our capital deployment goal, the exceptional operating performance we have delivered since we launched our investment thesis, means we are on track to achieve our 66% ADEPS growth target through fiscal year 2021, while still retaining optionality to deploy capital in a patient and disciplined way.Concluding with guidance please turn to slide 9. For fiscal year 2020, we now anticipate that revenue growth will be between 10% and 11.5% for the full fiscal year, the increase being driven in part by billable expenses falling near or slightly above 31% for the full year. We also now expect ADEPS of between $3.05 and $3.15 per share, while we are increasing our operating cash guidance range to $500 million to $550 million.The new ADEPS range is based on 137 million to 141 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%, which does not reflect research and development tax strategies that may result in potential fourth quarter benefits. Fiscal year 2020 guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is reaffirmed.We are extremely pleased to increase revenue, ADEPS and cash flow guidance again because of the outstanding operational performance our leaders have delivered. We are on track to deliver the continued strong growth we envision this fiscal year and the multiyear goals of our investment thesis are well within reach. We are executing with discipline and excellence, which gives us a lot of confidence and excitement about the future.Nick, let's open up the lines for questions.\nNick Veasey: Thanks. Daniel, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, Horacio, Lloyd and Nick. So good results.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Horacio, a question for you. The team has executed on Vision 2020 as you said in your prepared remarks in a pretty difficult defense backdrop to start the strategy. How do you think about the changing needs of the customer over the next 10 years? With a more positive budget outlook, how do we kind of think about how Booz evolves over the longer term?\nHoracio Rozanski: That's a great question to get us started. Thank you, Sheila. First of all, I need to start with a shout-out to the team. The work that was done from really 2012 to now to transform the firm and position us as the leading tech translator for the federal government has really been outstanding and it's really their success that Lloyd and I are here representing. When you look at our business, the numbers that we report this quarter that we report for this year the increased guidance, all shows that our strategy is working that this positioning as the leading technology insertion company, it has a lot of momentum in it.Everything we see -- every sign we see points to the fact that both from a readiness and a modernization standpoint the trends around technology are going to continue. And Booz Allen doesn't stand still. We appreciate the fact that the 2020s are not going to be like the 2010s. Great power competition is something we've talked about in the past. The digital transformation of the federal government is something we talked about in the past. Those are the waves that we believe we need to be in front of and continue to invest ahead of to make sure that over the next 10 years, we are anticipating the market not just reacting to it and we're shaping the market that we operate in.As I said in the prepared remarks, we're doing some work around trying to specify that a little more. But in general terms, we aim to stay ahead of the curve. We aim to continue to be a driver in mission innovation for our clients and we hope to then as a result create this kind of financial results that we've been seeing.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Yes. Thank you. And maybe as a follow-up to that solid financial results, revenue up 11%, up 8% ex billables but operating profit was less than that with a 6% increase. Can you maybe discuss puts and takes on operating leverage given the business model coupled with maybe hiring needs and investments you need to make in the business?\nLloyd Howell: I'll start Sheila. Our operating leverage has remained pretty consistent to what it's been in the past. And as we continue to onboard the talent that we need for the \u2013 to meet the demand of our clients, we're doing success \u2013 being successful at that. So we expect it to remain the same going forward and feel pretty good about where we are.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: Just Horacio, I wondered if you might expand a little bit, the prepared remarks around this concept of technology insertion and that being a theme. Although, there's clearly a need there, the customer has been somewhat stodgy and slow to move to insert technology.So as you think about, how you change what you do or help the customer change what they do, is there a difference you see evolving in your business model in terms of how you invest or how you interact with the customer to really enact that change? I just \u2013 I wondered if you could expand on that for us.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. We've been talking over the last few quarters about the fact that with more budget stability our clients who have a pent-up need to insert new technology have actually had the opportunity to begin to do so. I'm sure a lot of people on the call either attended or watched the panels at the Reagan defense forum last December for example.What struck me about the more than a dozen panels that included all of the key decision-makers in DOD, key policymakers all of the serious industry players, all gathered together and when you listen to the speeches on the panels, the one consistent theme was importance of technology as really a way to leapfrog this great power competition and we're seeing that in our business.If you get inside our revenue growth what has me excited is \u2013 the numbers are great. I don't dispute that. But more important is what's inside those numbers. And our work is totally aligned to this notion already of being the tech translator.So for example, we just launched a program where we're modernizing GPS systems across the Air Force and the Navy. We're using virtual reality for advanced training for the Army. We have many AI programs not just in Defense from the J-2, the operating units but more broadly in places like the FDA and almost too many to mention cyber programs that are mission-oriented, where we're protecting platforms not just networks.We believe that is an accelerating trend. We believe our clients are eager to continue to do that and they're relying on Booz Allen because over the last eight years we've built the innovation capabilities and the position to be able to do so. So I think that speaks to the sustainability of our market position. It speaks to why we continue to outpace the market and gain share and it probably also will speak to the resilience of our market position even with shifting budget scenarios into the future.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thanks. And just as a follow-up embedded within the head count growth, I wonder, if you might speak a little bit to what you're seeing in terms of attrition lately and if there's any \u2013 been any change on that?\nLloyd Howell: Carter, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected to grow our workforce by 5%. We also said that, we were going to come out of the first half more aggressively than \u2013 given the uncertainty with the budget at the time, and we're tracking to that. So we were up, I think 6.5% in Q2, 5.3% this quarter. So we are performing exactly with what we expected and we're also seeing sort of normal patterns of attrition tied to that. We're not demand-constrained. And with the expected head count growth that we're on track to deliver that has also contributed to us raising and tightening our guidance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open,\nJoseph DeNardi: Hey, guys. Good morning. Horacio can you talk a little bit more about the\u2026\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah. Good morning. The head count challenges within the intel side of the business? Has that been getting kind of better or worse of late? And what are the strategies to address that? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Let me give a little bit of context, because I think this is an answer that ultimately has to wrap around more than just intel. I mean, if you look at our business as you saw defense and civil are actually ahead of our expectations for the year. Intel is a little bit behind our internal expectations. And when you deep dive into intel the dynamic is that early in the year as we reported, we lost a couple of re-competes. And so to get back to where we want it to be we actually have to hire ahead of our internal plan in order to get caught up for this fiscal year and take advantage of the demand that we actually believe is there. We actually hired at our planned rate. We did not get above it. And we're very focused right now on accelerating our recruiting efforts.We've already made some changes to the approach. There is more to come and we're going to be working that really hard. I want to come back out to the entirety of the portfolio, because it's instructive to look at one part of the business and it's important, but I think it's important to also not lose the forest for the trees in that we do not run our business as divisions or silos. We run it as interlocking pieces. And so in this particular case, the implication or the demonstration of that is that some of the talent that was in our intel business earlier in the year was actually redeployed to other parts of the business because of the clearances and the skills that they have. And that's actually helped fuel the growth that we've seen in other parts of the business, which then when you put it all together takes us to \u2013 and Lloyd keep me honest. I think this is the first time in a while where our entire revenue guidance range for the year is in the double digits.\nLloyd Howell: Correct.\nHoracio Rozanski: So, it's really important to look at the totality of the portfolio because one of the things that we has always been really good at is managing our talent base really on a portfolio basis.\nJoseph DeNardi: That's helpful. And then Lloyd over the past couple of years, I think investors have had confidence in your ability to sustain the organic growth, because of how strong the book-to-bill is. You talked a little bit about that. But it's not as strong as it was. Are there any major factors to kind of point out in terms of protests or just larger opportunities getting delayed a little bit that's affecting that? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Joe, we don't see ourselves as demand-constrained at all, in fact, looking at our Q3 record backlog up 7.4% to $22 billion. And the 0.48 book-to-bill for this quarter is in line with where we were last year. We're certainly seeing a little bit more volatility quarter-to-quarter given that as we said in our prepared remarks, we're pursuing larger more technically complex awards. But the team is doing great and we're winning on those pursuits as well. So to Horacio's opening comments, the fact that we've raised and tightened guidance, we see our backlog supporting that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So, Horacio, you mentioned again the key drivers to your market being great power competition and digital transformation. That being the case, I would think that Intel would be among the highest priorities of your target market. Is that the case and if not, why not?\nHoracio Rozanski: I don't know that there is a highest priority. I think when you look across the portfolio there's real opportunity in all elements of it. We clearly see opportunities in Intel. We see the demand there. And as we've talked before, there are some constraints about the level of clearances required to work in that market but lots of opportunity.But if you shift to some of the other things I was talking about before, huge opportunities in Defense and tremendous need both in terms of great power competition and even some of the most recent political turmoil that speaks to the need of having the right technology to address those trends.And then in our civilian portfolio, everywhere from the VA to the FDA to the IRS, the need for new technology, the need to modernize -- this is a target-rich environment for technology insertion for technology translation across the federal government and we're on it.\nCai von Rumohr: Great. And the other thing you mentioned was that you are focusing on going after larger more complex programs. Historically, your strength has been that you're on so many IDIQs and you've basically been able to win business in smaller bites with greater speed than some of your competitors. How does the move to kind of chasing bigger elephants really kind of fit with where historically your strength has been?\nHoracio Rozanski: We're actually not moving to chasing bigger elephants to use your words. What we're doing -- the core of this business is still very vibrant around these midsize programs that are continuing to grow rapidly, that create tremendous value for the clients and that have all of the economic benefit that we've always liked.I think that the other reality is as you get closer to the center of the clients' mission, you do technically more complex work. Some of it is competed in this larger contracts and we have become quite good at going after them and capturing billion-dollar programs.But this is an add-on to create balance in the portfolio. It's not a replacement for what we're doing and that's why you're seeing the growth that you're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGavin Parsons: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: I wanted to follow-up on Carter's question earlier just when you're talking about the emphasis on technology and kind of the shift to software defined. I'm curious if you see any bigger opportunity to participate in what have traditionally been hardware programs or platforms whether that be something like a B-21 or GBSD whether that be in partnership or even competition with traditional hardware products?\nHoracio Rozanski: We actually are already in many of these programs and have been for years. And what's happening is -- our goal is -- seems to be evolving inside those programs to delivering some of these more technically oriented work whereas before, we might have been more on the program management side.So -- and I see that trend continuing and intensifying. As again a lot of the value moves from hardware to software, things like open architectures become of greater interest to the government.Cybersecurity of these platforms becomes a more important element that the government is investing in. So, we see opportunity in continuing to participate and in fact scaling our presence in some of these programs.\nGavin Parsons: Got it. And then on working capital, I mean even after you raised free cash guidance here I think it still implies around 90% conversion on net income. So, it looks like that still has a pretty big working capital drag in it this year.And correct me if any of those metrics seem wrong, but if revenue growth stabilizes as opposed to the acceleration you've had over the past few years, does that mean a bit of a lessening working cap drag? And do you see better free cash conversion going forward as a result? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean we don't see it that way. I mean with the strong balance sheet that we have the fact that now we're raising our guidance around operating cash, we feel we've got the ample capacity to meet our operating needs as well as our capital deployment needs.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJon Raviv: Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. I'm going to try Gavin's question a little bit different way. With the blurring of lines seemingly between hardware and software if you will and plus the customer always talking about software, software and technology as you mentioned Horacio at Reagan. To what extent do you sense that maybe some of the hardware companies are feeling like they may be left out and maybe they're investing or trying to hire or trying to acquire assets in this space to almost perhaps catch up in a certain respect?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll let them talk about their businesses. I think what I can tell you from our perspective is we see growing opportunity. Again as -- there's no doubt that there's -- the digital part of these value chains is growing in both value opportunity and probably profitability. And that's why we've been so interested in driving that into our traditional business and doing the kinds of programs that I described before. And that's frankly also why our option value opportunities are as interesting as they are because we believe there's a theme there of work that is actually going to continue to grow continue to add value. Things like Modzy are new needs in the market that nobody is addressing but us. And so I think there's really -- this is what is I think going to fuel our potential opportunity going forward.\nJon Raviv: Appreciate that. And you set me up for my follow-up. On the option value, I know it's hard to answer sometimes, but how much of the uplift we're seeing this year, is from option value, or do you think there's still a lot of prime growth in things like Modzy and District Defend and Rec.gov? Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I'll start Jon. Those initiatives bridge us back to the main business as well, certainly what we're doing with Modzy off of that application to -- back into what we're doing in our intel and defense businesses. Still too early for us to parse the degree to which, but certainly our business leaders see merit as well as the potential for these initiatives as it relates to the main of the business. We look at it on a portfolio basis. And as that portfolio continues to grow and strengthen, we'll have more to say about that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMatt Akers: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to touch briefly on the intel headwinds that you mentioned earlier, I guess some of these recompetes. Are those mostly behind us, or is there anything big to kind of watch out for in the future? And then on the head count side, we see all these headlines of the security clearance backlog running down. Does that maybe help you grow faster going forward, or is it more just a matter of kind of finding the right talent?\nHoracio Rozanski: On the first part of your question, our win rates continue to be very strong. Sadly, we don't win 100% of everything, but I actually think there's goodness in that, in that we're occasionally leaning forward into work that would be hard for us to get and we're still getting some of it. I think that's what drives growth and opportunity and I'm proud of the team for taking swings up some of those things. On the clearance reform thing, we've been part of the conversation with policymakers and with clients on this topic and we are glad to see that progress is being made at the macro level.At our level, it's still too early to see any real movement. There's a marginal improvement to some of the times for clearance crossovers and things like that, but on the whole and on the main, we still haven't seen an easing of that supply. But as I said before, the key for us is ultimately going to be we're revamping the way we recruit into those markets and we're still growing our head count at the anticipated 5% for the year. So we're feeling pretty good.\nMatt Akers: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess if I could just briefly on margins. EBITDA margin I thought looked decent in the quarter given that second half for you guys is typically a little bit weaker. But then I think your guidance implies a pretty big kind of sequential decline in the fourth quarter, if you could just kind of talk about the dynamics there between third and fourth quarter?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. At the top though, we're pleased with our margin performance for this quarter and it's very much in line with our expectations of low 10s through FY 2021. On top of that, you also see us being able to sustain it. We're operating extremely well at the contract level. It's broad-based.We've got systemic improvements in our contract life cycle from pricing, as well as to delivery. So from our perspective, it's certainly working, closer to clients' mission, more technical content of the work, our execution and so forth. There is a typical seasonal pattern to our margin performance, but as we have forecasted the year, we expect to be in the low 10s and we're on track to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: Horacio, just to ask another question about intelligence. Just as we think about the outlook and we think about the actions that you guys are taking there to win more, is it kind of a matter of anniversarying some of these recompete losses and so, we should look for acceleration in growth there, maybe in the back half of next year?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's too soon to put a time line on things. Like I said before, we see ample demand. Our win rates overall are consistent with historical. Our hiring is consistent with historical and we need to accelerate it beyond that and we're on it. So stay tuned. We're going to work this as hard as we can and as fast as we can and we'll share more when we know more.\nSeth Seifman: That's fine. Thanks. And just finally, right on the mix in the quarter with the high billables, was that kind of attributable to one thing? And what are the implications there going forward? I think, as a percentage of sales, it was fairly high. Is that just a timing issue in this quarter and it kind of reverts, or is\u2026\nLloyd Howell: Sure. We forecasted billable -- I'm sorry, we had forecasted billable expenses to be between 29% and 31% for the year and it's a little bit elevated from that, largely driven to subcontractor requirement in our defense business -- part of the business as well as ODCs related to that, given the strong performance in defense expected on our part, but a little bit elevated outside of the range we originally forecasted.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey. Good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hi, Robert.\nRobert Spingarn: A couple of things. Just, Lloyd, Horacio had mentioned that the commercial business was flat so far year-to-date, but I think you've also said that's one of the key drivers for EBITDA margin upside. And so I want to just reconcile this idea that that's going to improve, but the margin maybe contracts in the fourth quarter based on the comments a moment ago. So how do we think about that? And if commercial doesn't start to accelerate what are the long-term implications for EBITDA margin there if at all?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Well, I think, the first way to pick this up is, not only that we're pleased with our margin performance that we're tracking to the low 10s for the year, but you'll also notice that there's an increase in our cost-plus portion of the portfolio, which is offset by our strong execution on the fixed price and time and material work.In addition to that, our continued sale of the more technically focused work comes with a higher margin that's also contributed to that. As we have pointed out in our previous calls regarding commercial, after four years of mid-20s to low 30% growth, we are expecting -- and it's still growing this year, we're expecting for us to return to a stronger growth profile in the future. Once that happens, that will, from our perspective, contribute or be accretive to what I just said regarding our strong operating performance, with the federal side of the business.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then, maybe this is related to part of what you just said on the technology side. But the cost of goods sold were the opposite of billables in the quarter. They were very low. Is that a function of the high billables in the revenues, or is there something else there?\nLloyd Howell: No. We think its part of the high billables.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nEdward Caso: Good morning. Congrats. I had a question around the pace of award activity. The company historically is very sensitive to the September government fourth quarter. With the presidential election cycle coming up, can you look back in your history? Is there going to be more challenges for Booz Allen to hit that spike number in this September quarter? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: It's too soon to start to talk about guidance for next year or any of that so I'll refrain from that. Generally speaking, we don't see the outcome of elections until well after the election in our business. The bigger challenge to your question over the last few years has been the pace at which the budget gets settled and approved. And since there's a two-year budget deal there's -- we'll have to wait and see.In the meantime, as Lloyd and I have both said, there's ample demand for our services. We're bringing on talent strongly. And we at least for the -- as far as our crystal ball goes we expect that to continue.\nEdward Caso: My other question is around duration of awards. Just curious if across the portfolio the duration is getting longer. And is that helping your bid and proposal dollars stretch further?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. I think is the short form of the answer is the -- if you remember a few years back, parts of the government decided to try and limit things to three years. I think that that was not a good move for the government and it certainly didn't help industry.I think we're back to the more normal historical time lines. And so we've seen length of awards to prime up to sort of historical averages. We're happy to see that and hopefully that will be stable and continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. I kind of wanted to pull the aperture back. And as you look at what your next set of long-term financial goals might be, how do you think about kind of peak budget spending growth at least from a headline perspective versus funding that may be more applicable to the company? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. As we have said at the onset of our investment thesis, we expect to be in that 6% to 9% top line growth low 10s in terms of margin and 66% increase in ADEPS. Given the uncertainty with the budget going forward to the best of our abilities, we try to take that into account. So I'm hesitant to look beyond the horizon of our investment thesis.We have work currently underway where we are evaluating our strategy. We will take that into account. But also keep in mind, the firm has performed well in certain and uncertain budget environments in the past and we expect to do so going forward.\nTobey Sommer: As a follow-up, I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color around what your plans are to accelerate growth in the commercial area.\nHoracio Rozanski: We have a business as Lloyd pointed out before that was growing at this very strong double digits. We have a -- it's small business. It's 3% of our overall portfolio and it's less mature than the rest of the portfolio, so it will experience more volatility with few contracts that wound down.But we expect that business to continue its expansion into the future. We're optimistic about what we're seeing there already and we're looking at where do we go next as part of the overall strategic review.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCaitlin Dullanty: Hi, guys. This is Caitlin on for Ron. According to your 10-Q, it looks like you recognized a bad debt reversal of about $9.2 million in the quarter. Can you discuss the impact this had on earnings?\nLloyd Howell: It's a normal part of our operations our financing. It hasn't had a material impact to the bottom line.\nCaitlin Dullanty: Okay. Thank you. And then can you discuss the pipeline of upcoming recompete contracts and new business opportunities? Anything specific that we should be watching out for?\nLloyd Howell: No. It's -- the team is doing very well in shaping future opportunities. We don't see anything different than sort of the normal point of where we are in our fiscal year. And given our raise in guidance we remain optimistic of having a strong FY 2020.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Horacio Rozanski for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you everyone for your questions. Lloyd and I look forward to a strong finish to the year, and we're very proud of what the firm has accomplished.One more time I want to do a shout-out to the entire team for an exceptional job. They're working as hard as ever to continue Booz Allen's evolution and to sustain our growth by delivering unmatched value to our clients. Again, thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. Lloyd and I are very pleased to share our latest quarterly results today. As you saw in our earnings release, Booz Allen's momentum continues. Our business leaders are looking to finish the fiscal year strong and we continue to deliver the financial performance laid out in our investment thesis.At the center of our thesis is the expectation that our firm can achieve 66% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over a three-year period, from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2021. This increase would be driven by a differentiated market position that produces industry-leading revenue growth, an increase in profit margin and strong cash generation that supports a value-maximizing capital deployment strategy.It is gratifying to see that our plans and expectations are coming to fruition, thanks to both the operational performance and the financial stewardship of our talented team. Because of their efforts, today we are pleased to announce another increase in our revenue and ADEPS guidance for the fiscal year, an improved outlook for operating cash and another increase in our quarterly dividend.Today, we will discuss the full details of our third quarter in the context of the full year and how fiscal year 2020 is shaping up to support the three-year goals of our investment thesis and given that this is the first earnings call of calendar year 2020, I also want to take a moment at the outset to reflect on our firm's transformation.When we launched our growth strategy eight years ago, we called it Vision 2020, but we never meant to suggest that Booz Allen's evolution would end in 2020. This strategy was about setting a bold vision for the future and then relentlessly executing against it and that is exactly what we have done.We have moved closer to the center of our clients' mission, become more technically capable, established ourselves in the innovation ecosystem and expanded our portfolio of business, including a successful reentry into the global commercial market. In parallel, we have grown and diversified our talent base, more than holding our own amid fierce competition for tech talent.We also reinvigorated our purpose and values, which has enriched our employee experience and strengthened our execution. Our firm committed to Vision 2020 during a time when federal budgets were shrinking and our core market was contracting. It was not an easy time for our industry, but we knew that if we lean forward and invested, we would be the first in the industry to return to growth. And since then, we have outpaced competitors because we remain committed to the strategy, stayed close to clients, and took advantage of one of our greatest strengths as a firm.We're always looking around the next corner to ensure that we're investing in the right capabilities and talent, so that we bring clients what they need today and in the future. This consistently creates opportunity for our business and all stakeholders in it.Today, we're positioned as the premier technology insertion company serving the federal government. This has created the conditions for our continued success and has given us the confidence to commit to multiyear financial goals that clearly demonstrate our strategy is working. It is important to understand that Vision 2020 is solely the latest evolution in our firm's 105-year history. The environment around us, the market we operate in, and the technologies we apply are constantly changing. Our job is to stay ahead of the change. We do so by keeping one foot in the present and one foot in the future.Having reached 2020, we are taking a look at everything that created our growth and momentum. We're asking, what more or different we may need to do to maintain our edge. As was true when we developed Vision 2020, we'll retain all that makes us strong, supports differentiation and drives growth, and we will no doubt do some things differently to get ahead of any challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities.As proud as I am of our success under Vision 2020, it is even more gratifying to know that, we can contemplate what's next from a position of strength. We look to the future with a lot of confidence and excitement about what it may hold for our firm, our people, our clients and investors. My overriding objective and that of our entire management team is to ensure Booz Allen continues to outperform.Let me shift now to an overview of our third quarter. Our team has delivered another quarter of exceptional performance with continued revenue and ADEPS, growth strong profitability, and excellent cash generation. The latest numbers keep us well on track for a great year, ahead in fact of where we thought we would be when we planned this fiscal year. We said, we expected a strong first half, and a relatively more conservative second half.Our third quarter hiring and book-to-bill are consistent with that pattern. The market continues to signal strong demand for our capabilities, which has fueled growth this year and a robust pipeline of future opportunities. As we noted last quarter, our growth this year has been more uneven across our business than in years past. Our defense and civil markets representing three-quarters of our portfolio are delivering double-digit revenue growth through the first nine months. Their performance is exceptional.By contrast, our intelligence business has been constrained by the need for cleared talent and a couple of re-compete losses we mentioned previously. And our global commercial business is still tracking to be roughly flat for the year. We are proactively addressing those challenges. And at the same time, we continue to take advantage of the diversity of our business portfolio and the strength of our business model. Because we operate as a single P&L, we can shift resources and talent to focus on winning the opportunities of most importance to the firm, and then delivering them with excellence.Our pipeline particularly for large jobs requiring complex technical solutions is expanding, and we have ample demand to support our objectives going forward. As we approach the final year of our thesis, we have a lot of confidence that we can meet the ambitious three-year objectives we set for ourselves.Looking at the results from the past seven quarters, what really stands out is the power of our differentiation and operating performance. Against our core investment thesis objective, 66% ADEPS growth we are ahead of pace. And the path we have used to get here relying more heavily on revenue and operating margin growth than we had anticipated means we have significant balance sheet capacity still available.We also continue to move forward with option value capabilities. These are new business lines and business models that have the potential over the long term to further fuel growth. As I said before, for more than a century, Booz Allen has succeeded by keeping one foot in the present and one foot in the future. We intend to continue our evolution and our growth, so that we deliver near and long-term value to investors and all other stakeholders.And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd. Good morning, Sheila. That's a great question to get us started. Thank you, Sheila. First of all, I need to start with a shout-out to the team. The work that was done from really 2012 to now to transform the firm and position us as the leading tech translator for the federal government has really been outstanding and it's really their success that Lloyd and I are here representing. When you look at our business, the numbers that we report this quarter that we report for this year the increased guidance, all shows that our strategy is working that this positioning as the leading technology insertion company, it has a lot of momentum in it.Everything we see -- every sign we see points to the fact that both from a readiness and a modernization standpoint the trends around technology are going to continue. And Booz Allen doesn't stand still. We appreciate the fact that the 2020s are not going to be like the 2010s. Great power competition is something we've talked about in the past. The digital transformation of the federal government is something we talked about in the past. Those are the waves that we believe we need to be in front of and continue to invest ahead of to make sure that over the next 10 years, we are anticipating the market not just reacting to it and we're shaping the market that we operate in.As I said in the prepared remarks, we're doing some work around trying to specify that a little more. But in general terms, we aim to stay ahead of the curve. We aim to continue to be a driver in mission innovation for our clients and we hope to then as a result create this kind of financial results that we've been seeing. Good morning, Carter. Sure. We've been talking over the last few quarters about the fact that with more budget stability our clients who have a pent-up need to insert new technology have actually had the opportunity to begin to do so. I'm sure a lot of people on the call either attended or watched the panels at the Reagan defense forum last December for example.What struck me about the more than a dozen panels that included all of the key decision-makers in DOD, key policymakers all of the serious industry players, all gathered together and when you listen to the speeches on the panels, the one consistent theme was importance of technology as really a way to leapfrog this great power competition and we're seeing that in our business.If you get inside our revenue growth what has me excited is \u2013 the numbers are great. I don't dispute that. But more important is what's inside those numbers. And our work is totally aligned to this notion already of being the tech translator.So for example, we just launched a program where we're modernizing GPS systems across the Air Force and the Navy. We're using virtual reality for advanced training for the Army. We have many AI programs not just in Defense from the J-2, the operating units but more broadly in places like the FDA and almost too many to mention cyber programs that are mission-oriented, where we're protecting platforms not just networks.We believe that is an accelerating trend. We believe our clients are eager to continue to do that and they're relying on Booz Allen because over the last eight years we've built the innovation capabilities and the position to be able to do so. So I think that speaks to the sustainability of our market position. It speaks to why we continue to outpace the market and gain share and it probably also will speak to the resilience of our market position even with shifting budget scenarios into the future. Good morning. Sure. Let me give a little bit of context, because I think this is an answer that ultimately has to wrap around more than just intel. I mean, if you look at our business as you saw defense and civil are actually ahead of our expectations for the year. Intel is a little bit behind our internal expectations. And when you deep dive into intel the dynamic is that early in the year as we reported, we lost a couple of re-competes. And so to get back to where we want it to be we actually have to hire ahead of our internal plan in order to get caught up for this fiscal year and take advantage of the demand that we actually believe is there. We actually hired at our planned rate. We did not get above it. And we're very focused right now on accelerating our recruiting efforts.We've already made some changes to the approach. There is more to come and we're going to be working that really hard. I want to come back out to the entirety of the portfolio, because it's instructive to look at one part of the business and it's important, but I think it's important to also not lose the forest for the trees in that we do not run our business as divisions or silos. We run it as interlocking pieces. And so in this particular case, the implication or the demonstration of that is that some of the talent that was in our intel business earlier in the year was actually redeployed to other parts of the business because of the clearances and the skills that they have. And that's actually helped fuel the growth that we've seen in other parts of the business, which then when you put it all together takes us to \u2013 and Lloyd keep me honest. I think this is the first time in a while where our entire revenue guidance range for the year is in the double digits. So, it's really important to look at the totality of the portfolio because one of the things that we has always been really good at is managing our talent base really on a portfolio basis. I don't know that there is a highest priority. I think when you look across the portfolio there's real opportunity in all elements of it. We clearly see opportunities in Intel. We see the demand there. And as we've talked before, there are some constraints about the level of clearances required to work in that market but lots of opportunity.But if you shift to some of the other things I was talking about before, huge opportunities in Defense and tremendous need both in terms of great power competition and even some of the most recent political turmoil that speaks to the need of having the right technology to address those trends.And then in our civilian portfolio, everywhere from the VA to the FDA to the IRS, the need for new technology, the need to modernize -- this is a target-rich environment for technology insertion for technology translation across the federal government and we're on it. We're actually not moving to chasing bigger elephants to use your words. What we're doing -- the core of this business is still very vibrant around these midsize programs that are continuing to grow rapidly, that create tremendous value for the clients and that have all of the economic benefit that we've always liked.I think that the other reality is as you get closer to the center of the clients' mission, you do technically more complex work. Some of it is competed in this larger contracts and we have become quite good at going after them and capturing billion-dollar programs.But this is an add-on to create balance in the portfolio. It's not a replacement for what we're doing and that's why you're seeing the growth that you're seeing. Good morning. We actually are already in many of these programs and have been for years. And what's happening is -- our goal is -- seems to be evolving inside those programs to delivering some of these more technically oriented work whereas before, we might have been more on the program management side.So -- and I see that trend continuing and intensifying. As again a lot of the value moves from hardware to software, things like open architectures become of greater interest to the government.Cybersecurity of these platforms becomes a more important element that the government is investing in. So, we see opportunity in continuing to participate and in fact scaling our presence in some of these programs. I'll let them talk about their businesses. I think what I can tell you from our perspective is we see growing opportunity. Again as -- there's no doubt that there's -- the digital part of these value chains is growing in both value opportunity and probably profitability. And that's why we've been so interested in driving that into our traditional business and doing the kinds of programs that I described before. And that's frankly also why our option value opportunities are as interesting as they are because we believe there's a theme there of work that is actually going to continue to grow continue to add value. Things like Modzy are new needs in the market that nobody is addressing but us. And so I think there's really -- this is what is I think going to fuel our potential opportunity going forward. On the first part of your question, our win rates continue to be very strong. Sadly, we don't win 100% of everything, but I actually think there's goodness in that, in that we're occasionally leaning forward into work that would be hard for us to get and we're still getting some of it. I think that's what drives growth and opportunity and I'm proud of the team for taking swings up some of those things. On the clearance reform thing, we've been part of the conversation with policymakers and with clients on this topic and we are glad to see that progress is being made at the macro level.At our level, it's still too early to see any real movement. There's a marginal improvement to some of the times for clearance crossovers and things like that, but on the whole and on the main, we still haven't seen an easing of that supply. But as I said before, the key for us is ultimately going to be we're revamping the way we recruit into those markets and we're still growing our head count at the anticipated 5% for the year. So we're feeling pretty good. Good morning. It's too soon to put a time line on things. Like I said before, we see ample demand. Our win rates overall are consistent with historical. Our hiring is consistent with historical and we need to accelerate it beyond that and we're on it. So stay tuned. We're going to work this as hard as we can and as fast as we can and we'll share more when we know more. Hi, Robert. It's too soon to start to talk about guidance for next year or any of that so I'll refrain from that. Generally speaking, we don't see the outcome of elections until well after the election in our business. The bigger challenge to your question over the last few years has been the pace at which the budget gets settled and approved. And since there's a two-year budget deal there's -- we'll have to wait and see.In the meantime, as Lloyd and I have both said, there's ample demand for our services. We're bringing on talent strongly. And we at least for the -- as far as our crystal ball goes we expect that to continue. Yes. I think is the short form of the answer is the -- if you remember a few years back, parts of the government decided to try and limit things to three years. I think that that was not a good move for the government and it certainly didn't help industry.I think we're back to the more normal historical time lines. And so we've seen length of awards to prime up to sort of historical averages. We're happy to see that and hopefully that will be stable and continue. We have a business as Lloyd pointed out before that was growing at this very strong double digits. We have a -- it's small business. It's 3% of our overall portfolio and it's less mature than the rest of the portfolio, so it will experience more volatility with few contracts that wound down.But we expect that business to continue its expansion into the future. We're optimistic about what we're seeing there already and we're looking at where do we go next as part of the overall strategic review. Thank you everyone for your questions. Lloyd and I look forward to a strong finish to the year, and we're very proud of what the firm has accomplished.One more time I want to do a shout-out to the entire team for an exceptional job. They're working as hard as ever to continue Booz Allen's evolution and to sustain our growth by delivering unmatched value to our clients. Again, thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to take you through yet another fantastic quarter of performance. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we told you that we would be executing a front-loaded plan for the full year. To ensure that, we delivered another strong performance even if there had been budget disruptions.Our leaders have executed extremely well against this plan and we carried strong momentum into the second half. Our performance through December gives us the confidence to increase our full year ADEPS revenue and operating cash flow guidance for the fiscal year and looking beyond this fiscal year, reinforces our view that we will achieve the multiyear financial goals of our investment thesis.Let's go through the numbers. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the topline, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses grew by 11.2% and 8.3% respectively compared to the third quarter last year. The increases were primarily due to delivery on sustained client demand and our continued ability to successfully hire and retain talent.Year-over-year, we delivered nearly 18% revenue growth in Defense, our largest market. Civil also delivered strong results including revenue growth of 9% compared to the prior year period.As Horacio mentioned, our intelligence business remained somewhat constrained by the challenge of finding highly cleared talent. Its revenue expanded 1% compared to the prior year period. Collectively, our portfolio of businesses is well-positioned to continue delivering industry-leading organic growth as we have done so far this fiscal year.Please turn to Slide 7. Book-to-bill for the quarter was in line with historical performance at 0.48 times and our trailing 12-month figure is 1.21 times. Going forward, we expect a slight increase in volatility in our quarterly backlog as Vision 2020 continues to enable the pursuit of larger, more complex solutions-focused work in addition to our diversified base of existing business.Total backlog as of December 31st was $22 billion, 7.4% higher than the end of the prior year period. Funded backlog at $3.5 billion decreased by 0.7%. Unfunded backlog at $5.3 billion grew 17.9% and priced options increased 5.8% to $13.1 billion. We are encouraged by these strong demand signals.Headcount during the quarter grew by about 200 to approximately 27,200 or 5.3% year-over-year. This is consistent with our 5% headcount growth target for the year. We are proud that top talent continue to be attracted to Booz Allen's unique value proposition.Moving to the bottom-line, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $191 million, up 6.2% compared with the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.3%, down 50 basis points year-over-year.As a reminder, we had an adjustment to our long-term disability plan that benefited third quarter fiscal year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margins. Our strong margin performance this quarter is in line with our multiyear expectations for margins in the low 10s and continues to be driven by strong contract performance, efficient management of our business, and an ongoing shift towards higher-margin technically focused work.Third quarter net income decreased by 15.2% to $112 million, while adjusted net income increased by 10.2% to $113 million. As a reminder, net income in the prior year benefited from the effects of tax reform. The increase in adjusted net income was driven by improvements in operational efficiency. This translated to an $0.08 increase in third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.80. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 1.5 million shares compared to a year ago.Turning to cash, we had a very strong quarter generating $100 million in operating cash. This brings our total year-to-date operating cash generation to $366 million, 29% ahead of where we were at this point last year. Due primarily to the process improvements we've made in the cash collection cycle, we anticipate strong cash conversion during our final quarter this year.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure and technology. This includes new, secure and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines and continued growth outside the Washington Metro area.Please turn to slide 8. During the quarter, we returned $61 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We remain committed to deploying our targeted $1.4 billion in capital during the period from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2021, as outlined in our investment thesis. Our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged and we will continue to be disciplined and patient in order to maximize near- and long-term value for our shareholders.As Horacio mentioned, our Board of Directors has authorized a $0.04 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share payable on February 28 to stockholders of record on February 14. This is the second increase in the dividend this fiscal year, illustrating the emphasis we place on quarterly dividends as a component of our strategy to create value for shareholders.Turning to the balance sheet. During the third quarter, we completed the refinancing of our term loan B. This transaction modestly reduce the cost of our term loan, while also extending its maturity out to 2026. While our strong balance sheet gives us ample capacity to meet our capital deployment goal, the exceptional operating performance we have delivered since we launched our investment thesis, means we are on track to achieve our 66% ADEPS growth target through fiscal year 2021, while still retaining optionality to deploy capital in a patient and disciplined way.Concluding with guidance please turn to slide 9. For fiscal year 2020, we now anticipate that revenue growth will be between 10% and 11.5% for the full fiscal year, the increase being driven in part by billable expenses falling near or slightly above 31% for the full year. We also now expect ADEPS of between $3.05 and $3.15 per share, while we are increasing our operating cash guidance range to $500 million to $550 million.The new ADEPS range is based on 137 million to 141 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%, which does not reflect research and development tax strategies that may result in potential fourth quarter benefits. Fiscal year 2020 guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin is reaffirmed.We are extremely pleased to increase revenue, ADEPS and cash flow guidance again because of the outstanding operational performance our leaders have delivered. We are on track to deliver the continued strong growth we envision this fiscal year and the multiyear goals of our investment thesis are well within reach. We are executing with discipline and excellence, which gives us a lot of confidence and excitement about the future.Nick, let's open up the lines for questions. I'll start Sheila. Our operating leverage has remained pretty consistent to what it's been in the past. And as we continue to onboard the talent that we need for the \u2013 to meet the demand of our clients, we're doing success \u2013 being successful at that. So we expect it to remain the same going forward and feel pretty good about where we are. Carter, we said at the beginning of the year that we expected to grow our workforce by 5%. We also said that, we were going to come out of the first half more aggressively than \u2013 given the uncertainty with the budget at the time, and we're tracking to that. So we were up, I think 6.5% in Q2, 5.3% this quarter. So we are performing exactly with what we expected and we're also seeing sort of normal patterns of attrition tied to that. We're not demand-constrained. And with the expected head count growth that we're on track to deliver that has also contributed to us raising and tightening our guidance. Correct. Sure. Joe, we don't see ourselves as demand-constrained at all, in fact, looking at our Q3 record backlog up 7.4% to $22 billion. And the 0.48 book-to-bill for this quarter is in line with where we were last year. We're certainly seeing a little bit more volatility quarter-to-quarter given that as we said in our prepared remarks, we're pursuing larger more technically complex awards. But the team is doing great and we're winning on those pursuits as well. So to Horacio's opening comments, the fact that we've raised and tightened guidance, we see our backlog supporting that. Yes. I mean we don't see it that way. I mean with the strong balance sheet that we have the fact that now we're raising our guidance around operating cash, we feel we've got the ample capacity to meet our operating needs as well as our capital deployment needs. Yes. I'll start Jon. Those initiatives bridge us back to the main business as well, certainly what we're doing with Modzy off of that application to -- back into what we're doing in our intel and defense businesses. Still too early for us to parse the degree to which, but certainly our business leaders see merit as well as the potential for these initiatives as it relates to the main of the business. We look at it on a portfolio basis. And as that portfolio continues to grow and strengthen, we'll have more to say about that. Sure. At the top though, we're pleased with our margin performance for this quarter and it's very much in line with our expectations of low 10s through FY 2021. On top of that, you also see us being able to sustain it. We're operating extremely well at the contract level. It's broad-based.We've got systemic improvements in our contract life cycle from pricing, as well as to delivery. So from our perspective, it's certainly working, closer to clients' mission, more technical content of the work, our execution and so forth. There is a typical seasonal pattern to our margin performance, but as we have forecasted the year, we expect to be in the low 10s and we're on track to do that. Sure. We forecasted billable -- I'm sorry, we had forecasted billable expenses to be between 29% and 31% for the year and it's a little bit elevated from that, largely driven to subcontractor requirement in our defense business -- part of the business as well as ODCs related to that, given the strong performance in defense expected on our part, but a little bit elevated outside of the range we originally forecasted. Sure. Well, I think, the first way to pick this up is, not only that we're pleased with our margin performance that we're tracking to the low 10s for the year, but you'll also notice that there's an increase in our cost-plus portion of the portfolio, which is offset by our strong execution on the fixed price and time and material work.In addition to that, our continued sale of the more technically focused work comes with a higher margin that's also contributed to that. As we have pointed out in our previous calls regarding commercial, after four years of mid-20s to low 30% growth, we are expecting -- and it's still growing this year, we're expecting for us to return to a stronger growth profile in the future. Once that happens, that will, from our perspective, contribute or be accretive to what I just said regarding our strong operating performance, with the federal side of the business. No. We think its part of the high billables. Sure. As we have said at the onset of our investment thesis, we expect to be in that 6% to 9% top line growth low 10s in terms of margin and 66% increase in ADEPS. Given the uncertainty with the budget going forward to the best of our abilities, we try to take that into account. So I'm hesitant to look beyond the horizon of our investment thesis.We have work currently underway where we are evaluating our strategy. We will take that into account. But also keep in mind, the firm has performed well in certain and uncertain budget environments in the past and we expect to do so going forward. It's a normal part of our operations our financing. It hasn't had a material impact to the bottom line. No. It's -- the team is doing very well in shaping future opportunities. We don't see anything different than sort of the normal point of where we are in our fiscal year. And given our raise in guidance we remain optimistic of having a strong FY 2020."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Veasey.Nicholas VeaseyThank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings announcement. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We've also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2.I'm Nick Veasey, Vice President of Investor Relations, and with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and, therefore, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our Company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer included in our second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call.During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2020 slides.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 5.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. Today, we have the pleasure of reporting another quarter of excellent operational and financial performance. Our second quarter numbers demonstrate once again, Booz Allen's institutional strength and our leading position in the market.September 30th marked the midpoint of our current fiscal year and of the 3-ear period of our investment thesis. Lloyd and I are extremely pleased with where we are at this point against both our plan for this year and the multi-year objectives we set 18 months ago.Today, we will summarize the firm's performance operationally and financially and discuss our expectations for the remainder of the year. As always, we will put it all in the context of our investment thesis.Let me start at the strategic level. As you know, over the past 7 years, we have transformed our firm into one that is more technically capable, more innovative, and operating in more mission-critical areas. We are showing clients how to get value from technology adoption at a time when they have the need and the resources to do so.Our aim has been to capture rising demand that's driven by fundamental shift from the hardware economy of the past to the software economy of today and the future. This is our Vision 2020 strategy. And as I have said before, Booz Allen is in the pay-off period.Disciplined execution of our strategy has created powerful differentiation in today's market and, equally important, it has created a position of strength for us as we lean into the future.We have the agility, talent, and investment capacity to evolve our firm to meet the emerging demands in the market; demands driven by things like the fast-changing tech stack and the dynamic global strategic environment.We believe our proven ability to operate at the intersection of consulting, technology, and mission, while also anticipating what clients will need next, can sustain into the future of the firm's growth and our consistent record of performance.This is at the core of our value proposition for all stakeholders; from employees, clients, and investors, all the way to the people who are served by the missions we have announced and the problems we solved.This position of strength in the market is also the foundation for our core investment thesis goal of increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share from about $2 in fiscal year 2018 to about $3.30 in fiscal year 2021. The performance we delivered in the second quarter shows we remain on track to achieve our goal.You'll recall that our plan for this fiscal year was to come out of the gates fast, executing a relatively aggressive first half and a more conservative second half. We set this plan in place last spring because of uncertainty about the federal budget. And while there has been progress in the budget and appropriations process, we are in the new government fiscal year and still not at the finish line.But our strong performance in the first half of our own fiscal year gives us confidence that we will end the year at or above our original guidance, for both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share.Turning specifically to the second quarter. The results we report today are exceptional. We achieved a double-digit increase in organic revenue growth with excellent profitability. We had another outstanding quarter for hiring, I think, 600 people to our talent base, which brings us just shy of 27,000 total.Bookings were well diversified across our markets and seasonally strong as the government fiscal year ended, and as of September 30th, we set another record for backlog.As you know, we manage the firm as a single P&L. This fosters agility and collaboration, and allows us to channel resources towards the best opportunities. Through the first half of the fiscal year, growth in Defense & Civil, representing roughly three quarters of our business, is especially strong.In fact, it's ahead of our own expectation. The need for systems integration, digital transformation, and insertion of new technologies in areas such as cyber, data analytics, and immersive is fueling our continued success. Shifting to the intelligence market, demand is also strong, but revenue growth is somewhat constrained by the need to source and hire highly clear talent.In global commercial, which represents 3% of our business, we'll probably be flat this year after three years of growth about 25%. Still, over the medium term, we continue to see great potential for profitable growth in this market. In this time, leaders across our business are managing the business exceptionally well and capturing the right opportunities at the center of clients missions.Our teams, spread across hundreds of clients and locations worldwide, are skillfully delivering high quality services and solutions. They are helping transform organizations and advance innovation.On the strength of their performance in the first half, today, we're excited to announce increases in our fiscal year 2020 guidance for revenue, operating cash, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, as well as an off-cycle increase in our quarterly dividend.Before turning the call over to Lloyd to cover the financials, I want to touch briefly on one aspect of the final piece of our investment thesis, what we call option value. As you know, our firm has been focused in recent years on developing premier offerings in Artificial Intelligence.Because of the investments we have made, today, we have a robust AI services business across many civil, intelligence, and defense lines. We are proud to be helping organizations such as the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and other parts of DoD overcome the hurdles in moving AI capabilities from the lab to the field.Warfighters are eager to operationalize AI in ways that will maximize efficiency, speed decision making, and improve command and control. We expect continued strong growth in demand as more and more federal agencies work to integrate AI into their missions. This rising demand, and our capacity to meet it, is boosting growth on the services side of our business.And we are also developing new AI business lines and exploring ways to monetize our intellectual property. This is option value, because these new approaches have the potential to augment our labor based business model with new revenue models and enhance our financial performance beyond the goals set in our investment thesis.On this front, Booz Allen will hit a significant milestone next week. Because of our strong partnership - we will announce the limited release of an AI software platform at the NVIDIA GTC Conference next Monday. This is an early access prototype, with expectation that our production product release is about 12 months old. We do not expect a significant number of paying clients for at least a year. Still, this is an exciting step towards providing secure in-mission access to AI solutions for our clients, and we're optimistic about the potential it holds to fuel Booz Allen's future growth.And with that, Lloyd, over to you for the full results of our quarter.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio. And good morning everyone. I'm excited to take you through the details of an excellent second quarter for Booz Allen. We came into the fiscal year planning for an aggressive first half, and that's exactly what we've delivered.Our ability to plan for potential market uncertainty and execute against a proven strategy gives us confidence that we'll deliver another fantastic year of growth. This confidence is reflected in our decision to increase the narrow full-year guidance for revenue and ADEPS, and to increase full year operating cash guidance.Let's go through the numbers. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses, both grew by 12.7% compared to the second quarter last year. The increases were primarily due to sustained client demand, three consecutive quarters of hiring and retaining phenomenal talent, and an extra workday compared to the prior year period. We believe our success and execution in hiring are supported by our unique market position and high quality services.We are very pleased with the breadth and quality of the work we're winning, it's clear that demand for our solutions is diversified and that our strategy to be at the intersection of consulting, mission, and technology has made Booz Allen a valuable partner to an increasingly broad range of clients.Turning to Slide 7. Book-to-bill for the quarter was in line with historical performance at 2.68 times and our trailing 12 month figure is 1.22 times, both excellent outcome supported by a strong award environment and robust proposal activity across all markets.Total backlog as of September 30th was $22.9 billion, 7.2% higher than the end of the prior year period and a new record high for our firm. Funded backlog at $4.4 billion increased by 4,8%. Unfunded backlog at $5.4 billion grew 12.3% and priced options increased 6.1% to $13.2 billion.Headcount, as of the end of the second quarter, was up by 1,640 or 6.5% year-over-year and, as Horacio said, by 600 since the end of June. Our success in hiring to date ensures that we can continue to execute on our backlog and meet our objectives for the second half of the year.Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $192 million, up 17% compared with the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.5%, up 38 basis points year-over-year.Our margin performance continues to be driven by strong contract performance, efficient management of our business, and an ongoing shift towards higher margin, technically focused work.We have become adept at translating industry-leading organic revenue growth into profit, even as we support our businesses and our people for the long term. As is our typical pattern, we do anticipate a lower margin in the second half than in the first due to seasonal increases in unallowable spending, the roughly flat growth in global commercial that Horacio mentioned, and other factors.That said, we believe we will finish the year with EBITDA margins in the low 10% range. Second quarter net income and adjusted net income grew by 23.3% and 17.9% to $114.3 million and $114.8 million respectively. The increases are primarily due to revenue growth and margin expansion.This translated to a $0.13 increase in second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.81. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 2.3 million shares compared to one year ago.Turning to cash. We generated $216 million in operating cash for the quarter, bringing our total first half operating cash generation to $267 million roughly on par with where we were at the end of the first half last year. Additionally, due to the success we've had with the process improvements in cash collection cycle, we anticipate strong cash conversion during the second half, which gives us confidence to increase our full year operating cash guidance.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure, and technology. This includes new secure and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines, and continued growth outside the Washington Metro area.Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong operational and financial performance serves as the foundation for a patient, efficient capital allocation strategy that aims to deliver both near- and long-term value for our shareholders. Consistent with this approach, we returned $32 million to shareholders through dividends during the second quarter.We remain firmly committed to deploying our targeted $1.4 billion from fiscal year 2019 to 2021, in line with our investment thesis. Our capital deployment approach remains disciplined and our priorities unchanged. We continually evaluate all our options to ensure that we are maximizing the value of our capital for shareholders in the near, mid, and long term.This morning, the Company announced the authorization of a 17% off-cycle quarterly dividend increase of $0.04. The quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share is payable on December 2nd to stockholders of record on November 14th. This off-cycle increase reinforces our commitment to quarterly dividend growth as a component of our investment thesis.As you know, our normal annual dividend assessment occurs each January. And we expect to do that assessment as usual this fiscal year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, our exceptional first half performance combined with our record backlog and strong headcount growth support our decision to increase the narrow full-year guidance.Please turn to Slide 9. For fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue growth to be between 9% and 11%, more than 2 to 4 percentage points above our original guidance due to the exceptional top-line performance and strong bookings in the first half. We also are raising and narrowing our full-year ADEPS guidance given our strong revenue and margin performance to date.The new range is $3 per share to $3.10 per share for the full fiscal year. This revised range is based on a $137 million to a $141 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%.Finally, we have a $50 million increase in our guidance for operating cash. We now expect full-year operating cash to be between $450 million and $500 million. In closing, I'll reiterate that we are extremely pleased with our first half performance. We are executing exactly according to plan and we remain on a strong path.Heading into the second half of the fiscal year, the entire management team is excited about the success we continue to have and remains optimistic about meeting our multi-year financial goals.Nick, let's open the lines for questions.\nNicholas Veasey: Daniel, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah, hey. Good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nJoseph DeNardi: Horacio, I think when you guys provided the longer-term targets 18 months ago, they were generally more bullish than folks were expecting and you've now shown kind of halfway through an ability to have kind of multi-year visibility into your business.I'm just wondering if you could talk about how that visibility looks over the next few years in the context of a less bullish budget environment. I mean, I think that's the main focus of investors now in terms of can you all sustain this level of growth that you've been delivering. Maybe just talk about that a little bit. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Thanks for the question. We feel very good about the market that we're in. And, in particular, we feel good about the position that we have in this market. I think I've been consistent in saying that, for us, this is not about the overall size of the budget; it's about our clients who have the desire and the will to advance their missions especially through inserting [ph] technology, have the means and the resources to do so.And they do, and we expect that posture to continue into the future and we expect that our differentiation will continue to carry us to being to leader in organic revenue growth, continue to allow us to then drop that to the bottom line through strong margins in the way that we have been doing it. And we're confident that given the way our business is operating and our team is driving, that we see -- we believe the picture going forward is quite good.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you. And then along those lines, I'm sure there was an assumption around bookings that was embedded in that three-year outlook. Can you just talk about, kind of halfway through, the extent to which bookings you've realized have been better than what you were expecting? Thanks for the questions.\nHoracio Rozanski: Our booking environment is actually quite strong. As you saw, and as Lloyd mentioned, we have record backlog to report coming out of the first half of this fiscal year. I think, again, at the risk of being boring, we've been very consistent in saying that we don't feel we're demand constraint, that we feel that our continuing challenge is to find the right people with the right skills, to deploy them into clients as quickly as we can to fulfill the backlog that's available.And that we've been doing particularly well certainly this fiscal year and we expect that to continue. So, it's a good picture and, again, we believe that we can operate in this market with quite a bit of confidence, which is why despite some of the current budget scenarios we have raised and narrowed guidance.We declare the $0.04 increase on our dividend off-cycle, our headcount is up 6.5% in the first half, just six months ago we increased the back-end numbers for our investment thesis projection. I think these are all signs of confidence in the market and our capacity to succeed in this market.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hey, good morning everyone. Thank you for the time. And these results are never boring, Horacio. So, you're all good.\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, these are your headlines, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: In terms of -- Here's my first question on the headcount growth. It's growing pretty impressively, but still there is a pretty big delta between that and revenue growth. How do we think about -- Is that scope of contracts increased, is that just timing and it ramps in the second half? Can you talk a little bit about that?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Historically, if we are growing our headcount as planned, both sourcing and deploying the talent, there is a delay in getting those folks deployed and the conversion of what's in our backlog. So, as a rule of thumb, it typically is a few percentage points higher than what we see in terms of our headcount growth percentage, but historically, it's never been a one-to-one.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, thanks. And then just maybe longer term, Horacio, you mentioned the AI adoption and just accelerating processes on that you don't expect any paying clients in the next year, but how do we think about that overall market size, the adoption of it, how quickly do you expect it? Can you just quantify it a little bit more, add a little bit of color on customers that you think are attainable?\nHoracio Rozanski: So, let me give you some color. We think about AI as both a key component of our traditional business, our labor-based business, and as a huge option-value type opportunity for the future. And we're seeing success on both of them. In the prepared remarks, I talked about our work at the JAIC. But that is one of the many places where we are working with clients to figure out how to both create AI solutions, but most importantly, take them to the field.A few months ago, we talked about a win at HHS on AI. This is a broad-based demand increase that we see across most of our clients who are looking to use these technologies to improve mission effectiveness in intelligence, in operational Intelligence for the military, and in anything that has a big data component, which at this point is [indiscernible] of our federal government.And we're seeing the near-term upside of that in our labor-based business. In parallel with that, we've been looking for different ways to monetize our intellectual capital and to take advantage of the fact that we know both these missions and what the mission needs are beyond what is purely labor-based, and this is what this software platform that we'll announce in more detail on Monday does as it gives our clients access to train models in a way that is in mission, that is secure, that they can actually bring to bear in different ways. That's the piece that has more of a longer-term tail to it. We're still in the pre-release limited access period, where we're working with a few clients to test the proposition to improve the proposition to advance it.And about a year from now, we'll go into more of a full-production mode and then we'll begin to see, hopefully, revenues come from that. That's the path we want to be on. But you don't fit inside of these option value portfolio, which isn't one thing, it's a number of things. And at the right time, we'll come back and talk about what that whole group of initiatives looks like and what the potential financials for them are. It's premature to do that now, but it's certainly in our side.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thanks a lot.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific, thank you very much. So, your bookings this quarter benefited from the $1 billion VA ITOPS task order protest that cleared. Could you give us some color in terms of how much do you have in protest of your take-away wins, and roughly how much are you protesting contracts that may have been taken away from you?\nLloyd Howell: In terms of protest, Cai, overall, as I said in the past, the environment is heavily protested environment. Now, that being said, for us, we've got minimal amount tied up in protest and on the other end of the -- other side of the coin, also a minimal amount of protest ourselves.\nCai von Rumohr: Okay. And then you continue to look for a $1 billion foreign capital deployment. That looks to me like you've got to spend close to $700 million between now and the end of fiscal '21 on share repurchase or M&A. You didn't buy that much stock in the first half and your stock prices continued to go up. So, how should I think about the priorities you're setting on those two options?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, I mean, we are committed to returning the $1.4 billion through FY '21 and continue to look at all options; share repurchases, tuck-in M&A, our regular recurring dividend as Horacio mentioned, the fact that we did an off-cycle increase of $0.04 is in alignment with that, and the possibility of a special. But bottom line is, we remain patient, we're going to remain disciplined, we're always looking for what and how to maximize the value for our shareholders in the near, mid and long term, and we're in a great position. If you look at our operating performance and the strength of our balance sheet, which we've been working on for a number of years to make as strong as possible, we feel that being patient and being disciplined is ultimately going to return the $1.4 billion.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJon Raviv: Hey, thanks, good morning. Maybe I'll just follow along there for a moment. The $1.4 billion you said 18 months ago was based on a certain set of numbers over three years. Clearly, those numbers are higher. So, directly asking, why just $1.4 billion higher?\nLloyd Howell: We've never straight-lined our projections. When we put forward the investment thesis, it really was to emphasize the growth in ADEPS over three years, as well as the top-line growth of 6% to 9%. We felt that providing more color around our capital deployment target, that would be good. And as we have also demonstrated in the past, where we see the need to make an adjustment, we'll make that adjustment. So we're not ruling out that it could be or not, but we do feel it's important to stay in alignment with the plan that we have, which we're very excited about this year.\nJon Raviv: Appreciate that color, Lloyd. And then when you say tuck-in M&A, I understand what that means from a strategic perspective, perhaps. What does that mean from a size perspective, and is there a size on the patient [ph] or what you could call a tuck-in?\nLloyd Howell: Not really. I mean, we have always sort of reacted to what's the market making available to us, what are the broader financial implications of any particular deal. As I mentioned earlier, we're patient and disciplined. We look at over 100 opportunities every year, and given the strength of our organic growth, we don't need to buy revenue. And so, it is very much one of the levers that is at our disposal, just not one to-date that we've pulled a lot.\nJon Raviv: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nGavin Parsons: Hey, good morning.\nLloyd Howell: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: I wanted to ask you about just the growth and margin dynamics. Typically, with new contracts coming at a lower margin, faster growth often results in dilution. So can you talk about maybe whether anything has structurally changed, and if you could approach that from maybe a Booz-specific perspective but also from a customer standpoint. Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I guess I'll start and then I'm sure Lloyd is jumping out a bit throughout.\nLloyd Howell: Jumping.\nHoracio Rozanski: The dynamic for us is, our work through Vision 2020 has become increasingly more technical and increasingly more differentiated. And so we're on-boarding work that is at the center of our clients' missions, that is at the center of inserting technology into those missions in a different way, and that affords us actually in many cases better margins if not worst margins than what we have before. That was what we signed up to do through the investment thesis and that's I think what we've seen. That's why margins are up significantly. Frankly, ahead of our own expectations; If you go back 18 months ago what we thought we would do and what we're doing, we're better.I don't know that I can comment on how the rest of the industry behaves. In large part, we've talked in the past about the fact that this industry was bifurcating and that we were looking to occupy this place of differentiation where clients need quality, where quality really matters, and where high-quality and high-impact missions gets rewarded.And I think that's where we are. It allows us to enter this virtuous circle. Because of that, we can invest in new capabilities, we can invest in looking for and retaining the best people in this market, and it then in turn affords us the opportunity to continue to stay ahead.A - Lloyd HowellSo I would just add to that. The 10.5 in Q2, we're ahead of where we were last year and 10.7 for the first half of this year. I think it really points to a couple of things. Certainly, what Horacio mentioned in terms of higher margin, technically focused work being at the center of our clients' mission. And it's working. There is a dynamic that when you look at the percent of our cost-plus increasing, that margin impact, which is typically a little bit lower, has really been offset by our just strong execution on fixed price and time and materials work. And we have been on a mission to operate increasingly at a higher and higher level, and our team and our people have done just that.\nGavin Parsons: That's great color. And then, Horacio, you talked about the shift to the software economy. Can you talk about how that expands your addressable market? I mean, for example, your approach to the soldier as a platform wouldn't have been possible previously. So, how does that open up new budget areas for you that had maybe previously been reserved for hardware? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: It's a great question. I think the analogy that I would give; If you look at the car industry, right? I mean, the car I learned to drive on have exactly zero lines of code. It might have had a couple of wires. The car that I drive now is essentially on I-powered wheels. And the same thing is happening across defense, across intelligence. It -- Software is becoming the real source of value added and value creation; whether it's in space, on the ground, under water. And that's what we're seeing. And in that world, protecting that software and cyber security becomes a much bigger deal. Again, not just in the protection of networks, but in the protection of platforms. Analytics changes dramatically the way intelligence, both it gets collective and gets disseminated. And warfighting, changes. And this is the work -- I know, some of you, -- So, what we were doing at AUSA where, for example, we're creating data fabrics that allow multiple components agnostic as to who creates and to talk to each other so that a soldier on a visor can have the information that he or she needs from a satellite, from a drone, from an analyst; all coming into the same place. We're uniquely positioned to create those types of solutions. We're uniquely positioned to create open architectures at the edge and deny [ph] the environment. We believe that this is why we're already winning. This is the pay-off period for Vision 2020. But this is how we're leaning into the future.And I'm just talking now about defense any diligence; I could spend another 20 minutes telling you the same stories around fraud detection in Treasury and the Treasury area, about data and the value of data across the health -- the government health enterprise, about law enforcement, and the importance of all of those things.So, this is a market that, I think, we've been preparing for. This market is here now, and we intend to capture as much opportunity as we can.\nGavin Parsons: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning, gents.\nLloyd Howell: Good morning, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: So, I was going to tease you for another conference call after a holiday, but then you delivered a treat on Halloween. So, I'll tell you just keep doing what you're doing.\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, it would have been worse yesterday because all of us match [ph] plans; would have been a lot more tired. So...\nCarter Copeland: Yeah, yeah. I guess it worked out that way, but you did the Super Bowl and that was hard on Lloyd. So, just keep doing what you're doing.\nLloyd Howell: Thank you.\nCarter Copeland: Look, just a couple for me. One, I don't know if you can share the color, but obviously, the civil growth year-to-date has been very strong and I wondered if that was attributable to -- I mean, you hinted at a couple of those things in the response to the last question, Horacio, in terms of law enforcement and treasury and the health enterprise and -- But I wondered if you might show us some colors on particular agencies where you may have seen that strength.And then as a second question, just on the commercial side and the flat growth you talked about there. Is that just standard kind of lumpiness, or are there any geographic influences or particular sizable contracts there that did drive the kind of results you're seeing there? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Let me do the last one first, because otherwise I'll forget. In our global commercial business, we had a few contracts that wound down and that's what's driving the numbers this year. If you remember, back a couple of calls ago when we reported 32% annual growth in commercial, I, to be consistent, answered the same way. On the other side, which is a business of that size and of that maturity, a couple of contract going one way or the other; well, as you called it, lumpiness will drive the short-term performance, but the long-term drivers of that business, especially, our work in cyber remain very strong. We believe we're differentiated, and we're confident that it will continue to be accretive to our overall portfolio.On the civil side, that is the business that has done well for quite some time. The anchor player for that business has been our Health business, which we talked about in some detail on Investor Day, as you'll remember, and which has been growing very well and continues to do so. Cai asked the question about ITOPS. That's again the type of win. It's not just the size of the business and the growth rate inside of it; it's that the business has really moved to the intersection of technology and mission. And whether it is cyber protection of a major health agency, whether it is our ability to do agile development at scale, whether it is helping them do fraud detection in a different way and now beginning to implement AI and Process Automation; ***Part 5***\nHoracio Rozanski: Those are all the drivers of growth. If you look at this year, again, health is growing very strongly; what we call our FED business, which is really Treasury and the associated agencies, is having a banner year; and our law enforcement and transportation business is also doing very well, which is why you get to the strong double-digit performance, which again, it's exciting in its own right, but it's the underlying drivers of it that have me excited and optimistic.\nCarter Copeland: Great, thanks for the color.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nEdward Caso: Hi, good morning, congrats here. I'm a little curious as the market shifting more towards Tech and Solutions, is there a change in philosophy in dollars deployed around iRead? And also, if you could talk about your CapEx budget, the trends, and what the forecast is for this year?\nHoracio Rozanski: We continue to do what we do on the front -- I'll take the first half of the question; Lloyd is better positioned to take the second half. On the first half, we continue to do what we began to do in 2012, when we formulated the strategic innovation group, which is to lean forward into capturing positions in these new technologies, where we actually get to understand the technology, get to build partnerships with the external players oftentimes in Silicon Valley and beyond, and then bring that expertise and that knowledge to clients. So, that is an area of high demand and scenario where we intend to continue. if anything, we're -- our ccess allows us to open the upper tier beyond the original things we talked about in 2012 to areas like 5G, later communications and a number of other topics that -- at the right time we'll talk about in more depth.But that's a core element of our play and whether exempt through IRI or through simply deploying seniors into understanding these technologies and being able to more than on our clients, that's the game plan.\nLloyd Howell: And on the CapEx side of it, our CapEx expenditures are really aimed at continuing to support the growth we've been experiencing and to become more tactical, Just as a context we've been improving our facilities that allows us to source and bring on board the talent we want allows us to work in a manner. That's more collaborative innovative and then infrastructurally really upgrade many of our IT systems, Human Capital Financial will be consistent with that .We're likely to be around 120 million that is at a level that we think will be consistent with the objectives around our capital expenditures.\nEdward Caso: My other question is around the continuing resolution or they're already talking of extending it beyond November 21 at some point, does that change your outlook if we roll on into next year with a CR or fill CR. And then I guess that the flip question which is, if they miraculously get it done on November 21, would you be more bullish about your second half? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start. We're very excited to raise in there our guidance this fiscal year and at the very beginning of this year, you'll recall we forecasted that we wanted to come out of the gates very strong aggressively. We did that was the right decision at the same time, we said it was prudent to plan for some uncertainty in the back half. So we had a more conservative approach. So we've already taken into account as indicated at the beginning of the year and then with the raise in there o the (inaudible) said, we believe that demonstrates our confidence this year. So the broader end of your question you know that's we're going to address that when we get to a logical point this year. We're just not at that point, we're very excited about where we are in mid year and we believe that the raising narrowing of our ranges is indicative of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning. So excellent quarter Horacio I wanted to dig into AI a little bit and I wanted to ask if you could be a bit more specific in terms of what you're actually referring to are we talking about I guess machine learning, computer vision. It just seems like a term that could be unpacked a little bit and then maybe you could tie that into what you're going to be announcing within at the NVDIA conference to the extent that you can talk about that. And then I have a question for Lloyd margins.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure we are focused on really all aspects of making artificial intelligence,operational inside emission and so they starts with building the correct infrastructure to be able to deploy algorithms in a way that if they work in the mission have often said if you haven't intelligence analysts that has to go way outside of there -- their workflow in order to take advantage of a new tool that may not be fully tested that may not be perfect yet. The chances of adoption are much lower than these that can happen inside their workflow. If you have people working out in (inaudible) environment, where they don't have access to communications, how do you put those, how do you create the infrastructure so that technology can be deployed at the edge.That's one aspect of it, the second aspect the actual creation of both the platforms and the algorithms, but actually improve these mission sets. And the final piece is how do you feel them, how do you actually put them in place, working with the operators, so the algorithms themselves can be train, I mean this is dynamic technology, so it needs to be trained in the place where it's going to have impact to be fully deployed. How do you do that and we're working through that entire chain with a number of clients that are at the leading edge on that. And that's the data more is the breadth of our work in terms of the announcement on Monday, I'll ask you to just tune in on Monday and learn more of them.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay and then Lloyd, we talked a lot about the margin momentum that's coming from mix. Today, we talked about the software economy. I guess tied to the what we just talked about a moment ago. Are there also efficiencies dropping through? Or is that just not really the focus point here for margin expansion, just and what I think about is a variable cost business also with the tight labor market. So is it really simply a mix driven margin expansion?\nLloyd Howell: No, I mean you're right, I mean we have been focused on operating as strongly as we can, it's what we're experiencing now, which we also began to experience last fiscal year. As all of our change efforts to operate better and better are kicking in. And so, yes, for sure, there is the mix part of the business and what we do as Horacio has talked about. But our business right now is operating very strongly.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is now open.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. Could you give us some color on your commercial business and to the extent that we would make sense to we have been in your comments on AI, I appreciate that. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Our global commercial business I have you know, it's about 30% of total revenue. As you know, it has two significant components one here in the US, one more focused in the Middle East, North Africa region. The core of that business on the core of our strength is taking our cyber expertise and know-how and deploying that to help especially private sector clients address the near and longer-term issues that they face. Unfortunately, that is the business that has seen rising demand and I say importantly because it's driven by the threat. In the environment, which continue to increase and it's driven by adversaries who are more and more sophisticated. So the people that our clients need helping that need to be equally increasingly sophisticated and Booz Allen, I believe it's at the top tier of that stack. And so that's the business that we're building work continuously evolving it. We're looking for places where cyber intersects with all the technologies like 5G like AI like everything else, and I think that is going to be the continued source of differentiation for us?\nTobey Sommer: Could you expand what performance was like in the quarter and then also maybe touch on in your headcount growth. Is there anything meaningful difference in the pace of headcount growth, or sort of junior staff out of school versus more senior lateral hires? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: So, we obviously very pleased with their performance in the first half across the entirety of the business and very pleased with the hiring and the retention in the first half of the year. This is -- Again, we have a playbook, which we shared with you earlier that our team has executed so far through perfection, which aims to try and get ahead of any potential uncertainty around the federal budget by hiring aggressively in the first half, by putting lots of people to work in the first half. And then that gives us the breathing room to then operate the second half as we see the environment evolve, while at the same time not just meeting our early commitments for the year about narrowing and raising.\nLloyd Howell: I would just add that we have probably four generations of folks at Booz Allen, certainly at the more junior level. Summer internship programs, the changes that we've made there has really improve the yield of the candidates. We see, but we have a tremendous effort and always well with sourcing and hiring at more senior levels is really driven by the requirements and needs of our clients. And at more senior levels we also have an active recruitment underway. Just given their understanding of the various markets and the decision makers in the relationships they have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nMatt Akers: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMatt Akers: I wanted to touch on cloud briefly. So kind of with the jet I am moving forward, I mean, number one, when could that open up opportunities for you guys to build more stuff on top of the cloud? And then kind of on the flip side, are you seeing any indications that like the Amazons and the Microsoft of the world could use this to compete more directly with your business? like, are they hiring or competing for cleared personnel, for example?\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me answer the question holistically, which is cloud adoption is one of the major trends across that federal government, not in DoD. we expect that to accelerate, and I think these contract vehicles are in some ways, catching up to that demand as opposed to sort of being ahead of it. We work closely with all of the major cloud providers , because what they do. We cannot do and vice versa. What we do is unique is differentiated and it allows cloud to be deployed into mission in a way that is successful and effective. And we believe that at least for the medium term, those are the positions in the value chain that we and they we will occupy.So we're bullish about the ability, again a lot of what we talked about, we spend a lot of time talking about AI on this call. You need a robust modern cloud infrastructure to deploy those kinds of capabilities. So we see how the strong cloud adoption across the government benefit Booz Allen and it's another I think proofpoint on why we feel we're in the right place in the market at the right time.\nMatt Akers: Got it, thanks. And then I guess just going back to the long-term guidance, I mean the 56% [ph] EDAPS growth you're already kind of in the low threes this year feels kind of conservative, how do you guys feel about that and could we get an update to that in the near future?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah, I mean we're very excited about our performance to date and we never have straight lined our performance. But we have adjusted as it makes sense halfway through this year, which is tracking exactly as we had planned, we've raised and narrowed our guidance and we're on track for another very strong year. As we get closer to the end of this year will assess an update if we feel that there are any other metrics that need to be adjusted.\nMatt Akers: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Christopher Meakim with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSean Christopher Meakim: Okay, thanks very much and good morning what I wanted to ask a little bit about the contract types and I definitely appreciate that it's not contract type that dictates profitability but the fixed price was kind of flattish year-on-year in the first half and up only kind of mid-single digits on a two year basis. So what kind of accounts for the mix shift in contract as type as this growth has accelerated?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's fundamentally driven by the markets in the clients we support as well as their preference as to what contract site they would like to engage Booz Allen. The increase in cost-plus is really driven by our defense market, it's been growing fantastically that is the contract site that they typically turn toward and we've been responding appropriately as it relates to the fixed price, we typically see that in our billion market and obviously in our commercial markets. We have a very conservative approach to the federal fixed price contracts . And so I don't think there is really anything to read into it other than we're responding to our clients based upon their needs.\nSean Christopher Meakim: Okay, thanks. And then as a follow-up, as you think about sort of moving to your next set of targets and capital deployment, do you still think of yield as kind of the right metric to look at, if you saw the dividend increase today, if we saw another dividend increase early next year, it could still be kind of below the 2%, which is kind of a high-class problem to have, because it's the increase in the stock prices that's driving it. But as you think longer term is yields kind of the right target for your cash return strategy.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah, I mean when we put out our investment thesis originally the 2% was really over time. So we think we are deploying our capital and a prudent patient disciplined way we're pulling the levers that I mentioned earlier in the call. We feel that this is one that really, to your point is a somewhat of a high-class problem. But really speaks to the confidence that we have in our business and the returns that we can provide to our shareholders.\nSean Christopher Meakim: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Louis DePalma [ph] with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning Horacio, Lloyd and Nick. Cyber security, commercial and 5G wireless networks is a big steam right now since those networks are currently at the peak days of build out in the US and around the world. Is that a new growth driver for you or is the government leaving protection for those networks up to the wireless carriers themselves?\nHoracio Rozanski: I wouldn't put it off a single thing that we're focused on, but rather as again part of this overall trend where technology accelerating where these platforms are changing rapidly and we're securing these platforms is becoming essential is broadly based and broadly known the theft of intellectual property that our clients are dealing with Asians around run somewhere that our clients are dealing with the issues that our clients face in terms of protecting defensive and often to weapons platforms space and second tested domain cyber a second domain. To me, these are all of the kind and they all speak to both and for us opportunities to serve opportunities to our value to our clients and opportunities to continue to hone our skills and drive certainly 5G is in that mix. But it is not at least at this point a single or area of focus, as I said, these part of these overall picture.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So it's not disproportionate above, and in the other types of platforms that you're protecting?\nHoracio Rozanski: Not at the moment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got you. And one final one. I'm digging deeper into your 12% top line growth roughly how much of that growth is coming from like price inflation from your existing contracts as your existing contracts increase in scope versus new work that you're winning?\nLloyd Howell: Probably be a challenge getting added that specifically, but our win rate in Q2 62% for new work and 85% for a recompete, and that is up from the beginning of year and so that coupled with how we typically [indiscernible] proposals with rate, wage increases high to our more focus for taking to account, pricing as we see it at the time when we make submission.So at this level, of my level I am very excited about our win rate performance and the topline growth of that\u2019s been able to generate.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, Lloyd, and when you\u2019re renewing contracts, is there a general like price inflation upon that renwal/\nLloyd Howell: You know, is varies based upon the circumstances, we obviously take that into account as we\u2019re putting our pricing submissions and the government has been receptive to that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sounds good. Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s Q&A. I\u2019ll now turn it back to Horacio for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you. And thanks everyone. This is been a very robust Q&A session. Feel a lot to close this morning on a different note, I\u2019d like to shift gears and call attention to something that we at Booz Allen are very proud of. Because earlier this month at a special event, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Globe. Our internal business recourse group for LGVTQ colloquies and allies. Its easy forget, given the significant stride towards the quality that our country has made in the past decade, how rate it was in the late in 1990s for company\u2019s to provide benefits to domestic partners under children or to establish an affinity group for employees under allies. But that is exactly what Booz Allen did. And so then we\u2019ve consistory build on our record to support to quality which is why our firm has scored the hundred on the human rights campaign corporate quality index since 2010Our commitment to having every person on our firm come to work as their true authentic sales matters. It matters a great deal. It matter to those we are recruiting, those who are new to Booz Allen and those who been here since the earliest days. And its also one of the most powerful demonstrations of purpose and our values. We firmly believe that the 105 record of success for this institution comes down to people, to purpose and to passion. We take care of our people. We empower them to their best sales and reach their full potential. That\u2019s where our focus was years ago hen a courageous group of colleagues found a globe and its absolutely where our focus will remain.So I didn\u2019t want to let this anniversary past without publicly acknowledging that Globe members and all dimensions of our diversity, our central to who we are and critical to our continued success. And on that note, thanks again, for being with us on the call and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.+",

            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. Today, we have the pleasure of reporting another quarter of excellent operational and financial performance. Our second quarter numbers demonstrate once again, Booz Allen's institutional strength and our leading position in the market.September 30th marked the midpoint of our current fiscal year and of the 3-ear period of our investment thesis. Lloyd and I are extremely pleased with where we are at this point against both our plan for this year and the multi-year objectives we set 18 months ago.Today, we will summarize the firm's performance operationally and financially and discuss our expectations for the remainder of the year. As always, we will put it all in the context of our investment thesis.Let me start at the strategic level. As you know, over the past 7 years, we have transformed our firm into one that is more technically capable, more innovative, and operating in more mission-critical areas. We are showing clients how to get value from technology adoption at a time when they have the need and the resources to do so.Our aim has been to capture rising demand that's driven by fundamental shift from the hardware economy of the past to the software economy of today and the future. This is our Vision 2020 strategy. And as I have said before, Booz Allen is in the pay-off period.Disciplined execution of our strategy has created powerful differentiation in today's market and, equally important, it has created a position of strength for us as we lean into the future.We have the agility, talent, and investment capacity to evolve our firm to meet the emerging demands in the market; demands driven by things like the fast-changing tech stack and the dynamic global strategic environment.We believe our proven ability to operate at the intersection of consulting, technology, and mission, while also anticipating what clients will need next, can sustain into the future of the firm's growth and our consistent record of performance.This is at the core of our value proposition for all stakeholders; from employees, clients, and investors, all the way to the people who are served by the missions we have announced and the problems we solved.This position of strength in the market is also the foundation for our core investment thesis goal of increasing adjusted diluted earnings per share from about $2 in fiscal year 2018 to about $3.30 in fiscal year 2021. The performance we delivered in the second quarter shows we remain on track to achieve our goal.You'll recall that our plan for this fiscal year was to come out of the gates fast, executing a relatively aggressive first half and a more conservative second half. We set this plan in place last spring because of uncertainty about the federal budget. And while there has been progress in the budget and appropriations process, we are in the new government fiscal year and still not at the finish line.But our strong performance in the first half of our own fiscal year gives us confidence that we will end the year at or above our original guidance, for both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share.Turning specifically to the second quarter. The results we report today are exceptional. We achieved a double-digit increase in organic revenue growth with excellent profitability. We had another outstanding quarter for hiring, I think, 600 people to our talent base, which brings us just shy of 27,000 total.Bookings were well diversified across our markets and seasonally strong as the government fiscal year ended, and as of September 30th, we set another record for backlog.As you know, we manage the firm as a single P&L. This fosters agility and collaboration, and allows us to channel resources towards the best opportunities. Through the first half of the fiscal year, growth in Defense & Civil, representing roughly three quarters of our business, is especially strong.In fact, it's ahead of our own expectation. The need for systems integration, digital transformation, and insertion of new technologies in areas such as cyber, data analytics, and immersive is fueling our continued success. Shifting to the intelligence market, demand is also strong, but revenue growth is somewhat constrained by the need to source and hire highly clear talent.In global commercial, which represents 3% of our business, we'll probably be flat this year after three years of growth about 25%. Still, over the medium term, we continue to see great potential for profitable growth in this market. In this time, leaders across our business are managing the business exceptionally well and capturing the right opportunities at the center of clients missions.Our teams, spread across hundreds of clients and locations worldwide, are skillfully delivering high quality services and solutions. They are helping transform organizations and advance innovation.On the strength of their performance in the first half, today, we're excited to announce increases in our fiscal year 2020 guidance for revenue, operating cash, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, as well as an off-cycle increase in our quarterly dividend.Before turning the call over to Lloyd to cover the financials, I want to touch briefly on one aspect of the final piece of our investment thesis, what we call option value. As you know, our firm has been focused in recent years on developing premier offerings in Artificial Intelligence.Because of the investments we have made, today, we have a robust AI services business across many civil, intelligence, and defense lines. We are proud to be helping organizations such as the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center and other parts of DoD overcome the hurdles in moving AI capabilities from the lab to the field.Warfighters are eager to operationalize AI in ways that will maximize efficiency, speed decision making, and improve command and control. We expect continued strong growth in demand as more and more federal agencies work to integrate AI into their missions. This rising demand, and our capacity to meet it, is boosting growth on the services side of our business.And we are also developing new AI business lines and exploring ways to monetize our intellectual property. This is option value, because these new approaches have the potential to augment our labor based business model with new revenue models and enhance our financial performance beyond the goals set in our investment thesis.On this front, Booz Allen will hit a significant milestone next week. Because of our strong partnership - we will announce the limited release of an AI software platform at the NVIDIA GTC Conference next Monday. This is an early access prototype, with expectation that our production product release is about 12 months old. We do not expect a significant number of paying clients for at least a year. Still, this is an exciting step towards providing secure in-mission access to AI solutions for our clients, and we're optimistic about the potential it holds to fuel Booz Allen's future growth.And with that, Lloyd, over to you for the full results of our quarter. Good morning. Sure. Thanks for the question. We feel very good about the market that we're in. And, in particular, we feel good about the position that we have in this market. I think I've been consistent in saying that, for us, this is not about the overall size of the budget; it's about our clients who have the desire and the will to advance their missions especially through inserting [ph] technology, have the means and the resources to do so.And they do, and we expect that posture to continue into the future and we expect that our differentiation will continue to carry us to being to leader in organic revenue growth, continue to allow us to then drop that to the bottom line through strong margins in the way that we have been doing it. And we're confident that given the way our business is operating and our team is driving, that we see -- we believe the picture going forward is quite good. Our booking environment is actually quite strong. As you saw, and as Lloyd mentioned, we have record backlog to report coming out of the first half of this fiscal year. I think, again, at the risk of being boring, we've been very consistent in saying that we don't feel we're demand constraint, that we feel that our continuing challenge is to find the right people with the right skills, to deploy them into clients as quickly as we can to fulfill the backlog that's available.And that we've been doing particularly well certainly this fiscal year and we expect that to continue. So, it's a good picture and, again, we believe that we can operate in this market with quite a bit of confidence, which is why despite some of the current budget scenarios we have raised and narrowed guidance.We declare the $0.04 increase on our dividend off-cycle, our headcount is up 6.5% in the first half, just six months ago we increased the back-end numbers for our investment thesis projection. I think these are all signs of confidence in the market and our capacity to succeed in this market. Well, these are your headlines, Sheila. So, let me give you some color. We think about AI as both a key component of our traditional business, our labor-based business, and as a huge option-value type opportunity for the future. And we're seeing success on both of them. In the prepared remarks, I talked about our work at the JAIC. But that is one of the many places where we are working with clients to figure out how to both create AI solutions, but most importantly, take them to the field.A few months ago, we talked about a win at HHS on AI. This is a broad-based demand increase that we see across most of our clients who are looking to use these technologies to improve mission effectiveness in intelligence, in operational Intelligence for the military, and in anything that has a big data component, which at this point is [indiscernible] of our federal government.And we're seeing the near-term upside of that in our labor-based business. In parallel with that, we've been looking for different ways to monetize our intellectual capital and to take advantage of the fact that we know both these missions and what the mission needs are beyond what is purely labor-based, and this is what this software platform that we'll announce in more detail on Monday does as it gives our clients access to train models in a way that is in mission, that is secure, that they can actually bring to bear in different ways. That's the piece that has more of a longer-term tail to it. We're still in the pre-release limited access period, where we're working with a few clients to test the proposition to improve the proposition to advance it.And about a year from now, we'll go into more of a full-production mode and then we'll begin to see, hopefully, revenues come from that. That's the path we want to be on. But you don't fit inside of these option value portfolio, which isn't one thing, it's a number of things. And at the right time, we'll come back and talk about what that whole group of initiatives looks like and what the potential financials for them are. It's premature to do that now, but it's certainly in our side. Sure. Sure. I guess I'll start and then I'm sure Lloyd is jumping out a bit throughout. The dynamic for us is, our work through Vision 2020 has become increasingly more technical and increasingly more differentiated. And so we're on-boarding work that is at the center of our clients' missions, that is at the center of inserting technology into those missions in a different way, and that affords us actually in many cases better margins if not worst margins than what we have before. That was what we signed up to do through the investment thesis and that's I think what we've seen. That's why margins are up significantly. Frankly, ahead of our own expectations; If you go back 18 months ago what we thought we would do and what we're doing, we're better.I don't know that I can comment on how the rest of the industry behaves. In large part, we've talked in the past about the fact that this industry was bifurcating and that we were looking to occupy this place of differentiation where clients need quality, where quality really matters, and where high-quality and high-impact missions gets rewarded.And I think that's where we are. It allows us to enter this virtuous circle. Because of that, we can invest in new capabilities, we can invest in looking for and retaining the best people in this market, and it then in turn affords us the opportunity to continue to stay ahead.A - Lloyd HowellSo I would just add to that. The 10.5 in Q2, we're ahead of where we were last year and 10.7 for the first half of this year. I think it really points to a couple of things. Certainly, what Horacio mentioned in terms of higher margin, technically focused work being at the center of our clients' mission. And it's working. There is a dynamic that when you look at the percent of our cost-plus increasing, that margin impact, which is typically a little bit lower, has really been offset by our just strong execution on fixed price and time and materials work. And we have been on a mission to operate increasingly at a higher and higher level, and our team and our people have done just that. It's a great question. I think the analogy that I would give; If you look at the car industry, right? I mean, the car I learned to drive on have exactly zero lines of code. It might have had a couple of wires. The car that I drive now is essentially on I-powered wheels. And the same thing is happening across defense, across intelligence. It -- Software is becoming the real source of value added and value creation; whether it's in space, on the ground, under water. And that's what we're seeing. And in that world, protecting that software and cyber security becomes a much bigger deal. Again, not just in the protection of networks, but in the protection of platforms. Analytics changes dramatically the way intelligence, both it gets collective and gets disseminated. And warfighting, changes. And this is the work -- I know, some of you, -- So, what we were doing at AUSA where, for example, we're creating data fabrics that allow multiple components agnostic as to who creates and to talk to each other so that a soldier on a visor can have the information that he or she needs from a satellite, from a drone, from an analyst; all coming into the same place. We're uniquely positioned to create those types of solutions. We're uniquely positioned to create open architectures at the edge and deny [ph] the environment. We believe that this is why we're already winning. This is the pay-off period for Vision 2020. But this is how we're leaning into the future.And I'm just talking now about defense any diligence; I could spend another 20 minutes telling you the same stories around fraud detection in Treasury and the Treasury area, about data and the value of data across the health -- the government health enterprise, about law enforcement, and the importance of all of those things.So, this is a market that, I think, we've been preparing for. This market is here now, and we intend to capture as much opportunity as we can. Well, it would have been worse yesterday because all of us match [ph] plans; would have been a lot more tired. So... Sure. Let me do the last one first, because otherwise I'll forget. In our global commercial business, we had a few contracts that wound down and that's what's driving the numbers this year. If you remember, back a couple of calls ago when we reported 32% annual growth in commercial, I, to be consistent, answered the same way. On the other side, which is a business of that size and of that maturity, a couple of contract going one way or the other; well, as you called it, lumpiness will drive the short-term performance, but the long-term drivers of that business, especially, our work in cyber remain very strong. We believe we're differentiated, and we're confident that it will continue to be accretive to our overall portfolio.On the civil side, that is the business that has done well for quite some time. The anchor player for that business has been our Health business, which we talked about in some detail on Investor Day, as you'll remember, and which has been growing very well and continues to do so. Cai asked the question about ITOPS. That's again the type of win. It's not just the size of the business and the growth rate inside of it; it's that the business has really moved to the intersection of technology and mission. And whether it is cyber protection of a major health agency, whether it is our ability to do agile development at scale, whether it is helping them do fraud detection in a different way and now beginning to implement AI and Process Automation; ***Part 5*** Those are all the drivers of growth. If you look at this year, again, health is growing very strongly; what we call our FED business, which is really Treasury and the associated agencies, is having a banner year; and our law enforcement and transportation business is also doing very well, which is why you get to the strong double-digit performance, which again, it's exciting in its own right, but it's the underlying drivers of it that have me excited and optimistic. Sure. We continue to do what we do on the front -- I'll take the first half of the question; Lloyd is better positioned to take the second half. On the first half, we continue to do what we began to do in 2012, when we formulated the strategic innovation group, which is to lean forward into capturing positions in these new technologies, where we actually get to understand the technology, get to build partnerships with the external players oftentimes in Silicon Valley and beyond, and then bring that expertise and that knowledge to clients. So, that is an area of high demand and scenario where we intend to continue. if anything, we're -- our ccess allows us to open the upper tier beyond the original things we talked about in 2012 to areas like 5G, later communications and a number of other topics that -- at the right time we'll talk about in more depth.But that's a core element of our play and whether exempt through IRI or through simply deploying seniors into understanding these technologies and being able to more than on our clients, that's the game plan. I'll start. We're very excited to raise in there our guidance this fiscal year and at the very beginning of this year, you'll recall we forecasted that we wanted to come out of the gates very strong aggressively. We did that was the right decision at the same time, we said it was prudent to plan for some uncertainty in the back half. So we had a more conservative approach. So we've already taken into account as indicated at the beginning of the year and then with the raise in there o the (inaudible) said, we believe that demonstrates our confidence this year. So the broader end of your question you know that's we're going to address that when we get to a logical point this year. We're just not at that point, we're very excited about where we are in mid year and we believe that the raising narrowing of our ranges is indicative of that. Sure we are focused on really all aspects of making artificial intelligence,operational inside emission and so they starts with building the correct infrastructure to be able to deploy algorithms in a way that if they work in the mission have often said if you haven't intelligence analysts that has to go way outside of there -- their workflow in order to take advantage of a new tool that may not be fully tested that may not be perfect yet. The chances of adoption are much lower than these that can happen inside their workflow. If you have people working out in (inaudible) environment, where they don't have access to communications, how do you put those, how do you create the infrastructure so that technology can be deployed at the edge.That's one aspect of it, the second aspect the actual creation of both the platforms and the algorithms, but actually improve these mission sets. And the final piece is how do you feel them, how do you actually put them in place, working with the operators, so the algorithms themselves can be train, I mean this is dynamic technology, so it needs to be trained in the place where it's going to have impact to be fully deployed. How do you do that and we're working through that entire chain with a number of clients that are at the leading edge on that. And that's the data more is the breadth of our work in terms of the announcement on Monday, I'll ask you to just tune in on Monday and learn more of them. Our global commercial business I have you know, it's about 30% of total revenue. As you know, it has two significant components one here in the US, one more focused in the Middle East, North Africa region. The core of that business on the core of our strength is taking our cyber expertise and know-how and deploying that to help especially private sector clients address the near and longer-term issues that they face. Unfortunately, that is the business that has seen rising demand and I say importantly because it's driven by the threat. In the environment, which continue to increase and it's driven by adversaries who are more and more sophisticated. So the people that our clients need helping that need to be equally increasingly sophisticated and Booz Allen, I believe it's at the top tier of that stack. And so that's the business that we're building work continuously evolving it. We're looking for places where cyber intersects with all the technologies like 5G like AI like everything else, and I think that is going to be the continued source of differentiation for us? So, we obviously very pleased with their performance in the first half across the entirety of the business and very pleased with the hiring and the retention in the first half of the year. This is -- Again, we have a playbook, which we shared with you earlier that our team has executed so far through perfection, which aims to try and get ahead of any potential uncertainty around the federal budget by hiring aggressively in the first half, by putting lots of people to work in the first half. And then that gives us the breathing room to then operate the second half as we see the environment evolve, while at the same time not just meeting our early commitments for the year about narrowing and raising. Good morning. Let me answer the question holistically, which is cloud adoption is one of the major trends across that federal government, not in DoD. we expect that to accelerate, and I think these contract vehicles are in some ways, catching up to that demand as opposed to sort of being ahead of it. We work closely with all of the major cloud providers , because what they do. We cannot do and vice versa. What we do is unique is differentiated and it allows cloud to be deployed into mission in a way that is successful and effective. And we believe that at least for the medium term, those are the positions in the value chain that we and they we will occupy.So we're bullish about the ability, again a lot of what we talked about, we spend a lot of time talking about AI on this call. You need a robust modern cloud infrastructure to deploy those kinds of capabilities. So we see how the strong cloud adoption across the government benefit Booz Allen and it's another I think proofpoint on why we feel we're in the right place in the market at the right time. Yeah, I mean we're very excited about our performance to date and we never have straight lined our performance. But we have adjusted as it makes sense halfway through this year, which is tracking exactly as we had planned, we've raised and narrowed our guidance and we're on track for another very strong year. As we get closer to the end of this year will assess an update if we feel that there are any other metrics that need to be adjusted. It's fundamentally driven by the markets in the clients we support as well as their preference as to what contract site they would like to engage Booz Allen. The increase in cost-plus is really driven by our defense market, it's been growing fantastically that is the contract site that they typically turn toward and we've been responding appropriately as it relates to the fixed price, we typically see that in our billion market and obviously in our commercial markets. We have a very conservative approach to the federal fixed price contracts . And so I don't think there is really anything to read into it other than we're responding to our clients based upon their needs. Yeah, I mean when we put out our investment thesis originally the 2% was really over time. So we think we are deploying our capital and a prudent patient disciplined way we're pulling the levers that I mentioned earlier in the call. We feel that this is one that really, to your point is a somewhat of a high-class problem. But really speaks to the confidence that we have in our business and the returns that we can provide to our shareholders. I wouldn't put it off a single thing that we're focused on, but rather as again part of this overall trend where technology accelerating where these platforms are changing rapidly and we're securing these platforms is becoming essential is broadly based and broadly known the theft of intellectual property that our clients are dealing with Asians around run somewhere that our clients are dealing with the issues that our clients face in terms of protecting defensive and often to weapons platforms space and second tested domain cyber a second domain. To me, these are all of the kind and they all speak to both and for us opportunities to serve opportunities to our value to our clients and opportunities to continue to hone our skills and drive certainly 5G is in that mix. But it is not at least at this point a single or area of focus, as I said, these part of these overall picture. Not at the moment. Thank you. And thanks everyone. This is been a very robust Q&A session. Feel a lot to close this morning on a different note, I'd like to shift gears and call attention to something that we at Booz Allen are very proud of. Because earlier this month at a special event, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Globe. Our internal business recourse group for LGVTQ colloquies and allies. Its easy forget, given the significant stride towards the quality that our country has made in the past decade, how rate it was in the late in 1990s for company's to provide benefits to domestic partners under children or to establish an affinity group for employees under allies. But that is exactly what Booz Allen did. And so then we've consistory build on our record to support to quality which is why our firm has scored the hundred on the human rights campaign corporate quality index since 2010Our commitment to having every person on our firm come to work as their true authentic sales matters. It matters a great deal. It matter to those we are recruiting, those who are new to Booz Allen and those who been here since the earliest days. And its also one of the most powerful demonstrations of purpose and our values. We firmly believe that the 105 record of success for this institution comes down to people, to purpose and to passion. We take care of our people. We empower them to their best sales and reach their full potential. That's where our focus was years ago hen a courageous group of colleagues found a globe and its absolutely where our focus will remain.So I didn't want to let this anniversary past without publicly acknowledging that Globe members and all dimensions of our diversity, our central to who we are and critical to our continued success. And on that note, thanks again, for being with us on the call and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio. And good morning everyone. I'm excited to take you through the details of an excellent second quarter for Booz Allen. We came into the fiscal year planning for an aggressive first half, and that's exactly what we've delivered.Our ability to plan for potential market uncertainty and execute against a proven strategy gives us confidence that we'll deliver another fantastic year of growth. This confidence is reflected in our decision to increase the narrow full-year guidance for revenue and ADEPS, and to increase full year operating cash guidance.Let's go through the numbers. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses, both grew by 12.7% compared to the second quarter last year. The increases were primarily due to sustained client demand, three consecutive quarters of hiring and retaining phenomenal talent, and an extra workday compared to the prior year period. We believe our success and execution in hiring are supported by our unique market position and high quality services.We are very pleased with the breadth and quality of the work we're winning, it's clear that demand for our solutions is diversified and that our strategy to be at the intersection of consulting, mission, and technology has made Booz Allen a valuable partner to an increasingly broad range of clients.Turning to Slide 7. Book-to-bill for the quarter was in line with historical performance at 2.68 times and our trailing 12 month figure is 1.22 times, both excellent outcome supported by a strong award environment and robust proposal activity across all markets.Total backlog as of September 30th was $22.9 billion, 7.2% higher than the end of the prior year period and a new record high for our firm. Funded backlog at $4.4 billion increased by 4,8%. Unfunded backlog at $5.4 billion grew 12.3% and priced options increased 6.1% to $13.2 billion.Headcount, as of the end of the second quarter, was up by 1,640 or 6.5% year-over-year and, as Horacio said, by 600 since the end of June. Our success in hiring to date ensures that we can continue to execute on our backlog and meet our objectives for the second half of the year.Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $192 million, up 17% compared with the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.5%, up 38 basis points year-over-year.Our margin performance continues to be driven by strong contract performance, efficient management of our business, and an ongoing shift towards higher margin, technically focused work.We have become adept at translating industry-leading organic revenue growth into profit, even as we support our businesses and our people for the long term. As is our typical pattern, we do anticipate a lower margin in the second half than in the first due to seasonal increases in unallowable spending, the roughly flat growth in global commercial that Horacio mentioned, and other factors.That said, we believe we will finish the year with EBITDA margins in the low 10% range. Second quarter net income and adjusted net income grew by 23.3% and 17.9% to $114.3 million and $114.8 million respectively. The increases are primarily due to revenue growth and margin expansion.This translated to a $0.13 increase in second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.81. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 2.3 million shares compared to one year ago.Turning to cash. We generated $216 million in operating cash for the quarter, bringing our total first half operating cash generation to $267 million roughly on par with where we were at the end of the first half last year. Additionally, due to the success we've had with the process improvements in cash collection cycle, we anticipate strong cash conversion during the second half, which gives us confidence to increase our full year operating cash guidance.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure, and technology. This includes new secure and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines, and continued growth outside the Washington Metro area.Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong operational and financial performance serves as the foundation for a patient, efficient capital allocation strategy that aims to deliver both near- and long-term value for our shareholders. Consistent with this approach, we returned $32 million to shareholders through dividends during the second quarter.We remain firmly committed to deploying our targeted $1.4 billion from fiscal year 2019 to 2021, in line with our investment thesis. Our capital deployment approach remains disciplined and our priorities unchanged. We continually evaluate all our options to ensure that we are maximizing the value of our capital for shareholders in the near, mid, and long term.This morning, the Company announced the authorization of a 17% off-cycle quarterly dividend increase of $0.04. The quarterly dividend of $0.27 per share is payable on December 2nd to stockholders of record on November 14th. This off-cycle increase reinforces our commitment to quarterly dividend growth as a component of our investment thesis.As you know, our normal annual dividend assessment occurs each January. And we expect to do that assessment as usual this fiscal year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, our exceptional first half performance combined with our record backlog and strong headcount growth support our decision to increase the narrow full-year guidance.Please turn to Slide 9. For fiscal year 2020, we now expect revenue growth to be between 9% and 11%, more than 2 to 4 percentage points above our original guidance due to the exceptional top-line performance and strong bookings in the first half. We also are raising and narrowing our full-year ADEPS guidance given our strong revenue and margin performance to date.The new range is $3 per share to $3.10 per share for the full fiscal year. This revised range is based on a $137 million to a $141 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%.Finally, we have a $50 million increase in our guidance for operating cash. We now expect full-year operating cash to be between $450 million and $500 million. In closing, I'll reiterate that we are extremely pleased with our first half performance. We are executing exactly according to plan and we remain on a strong path.Heading into the second half of the fiscal year, the entire management team is excited about the success we continue to have and remains optimistic about meeting our multi-year financial goals.Nick, let's open the lines for questions. Sure. Historically, if we are growing our headcount as planned, both sourcing and deploying the talent, there is a delay in getting those folks deployed and the conversion of what's in our backlog. So, as a rule of thumb, it typically is a few percentage points higher than what we see in terms of our headcount growth percentage, but historically, it's never been a one-to-one. In terms of protest, Cai, overall, as I said in the past, the environment is heavily protested environment. Now, that being said, for us, we've got minimal amount tied up in protest and on the other end of the -- other side of the coin, also a minimal amount of protest ourselves. Yeah, I mean, we are committed to returning the $1.4 billion through FY '21 and continue to look at all options; share repurchases, tuck-in M&A, our regular recurring dividend as Horacio mentioned, the fact that we did an off-cycle increase of $0.04 is in alignment with that, and the possibility of a special. But bottom line is, we remain patient, we're going to remain disciplined, we're always looking for what and how to maximize the value for our shareholders in the near, mid and long term, and we're in a great position. If you look at our operating performance and the strength of our balance sheet, which we've been working on for a number of years to make as strong as possible, we feel that being patient and being disciplined is ultimately going to return the $1.4 billion. We've never straight-lined our projections. When we put forward the investment thesis, it really was to emphasize the growth in ADEPS over three years, as well as the top-line growth of 6% to 9%. We felt that providing more color around our capital deployment target, that would be good. And as we have also demonstrated in the past, where we see the need to make an adjustment, we'll make that adjustment. So we're not ruling out that it could be or not, but we do feel it's important to stay in alignment with the plan that we have, which we're very excited about this year. Not really. I mean, we have always sort of reacted to what's the market making available to us, what are the broader financial implications of any particular deal. As I mentioned earlier, we're patient and disciplined. We look at over 100 opportunities every year, and given the strength of our organic growth, we don't need to buy revenue. And so, it is very much one of the levers that is at our disposal, just not one to-date that we've pulled a lot. Good morning. Jumping. Good morning, Carter. Thank you. And on the CapEx side of it, our CapEx expenditures are really aimed at continuing to support the growth we've been experiencing and to become more tactical, Just as a context we've been improving our facilities that allows us to source and bring on board the talent we want allows us to work in a manner. That's more collaborative innovative and then infrastructurally really upgrade many of our IT systems, Human Capital Financial will be consistent with that .We're likely to be around 120 million that is at a level that we think will be consistent with the objectives around our capital expenditures. No, I mean you're right, I mean we have been focused on operating as strongly as we can, it's what we're experiencing now, which we also began to experience last fiscal year. As all of our change efforts to operate better and better are kicking in. And so, yes, for sure, there is the mix part of the business and what we do as Horacio has talked about. But our business right now is operating very strongly. I would just add that we have probably four generations of folks at Booz Allen, certainly at the more junior level. Summer internship programs, the changes that we've made there has really improve the yield of the candidates. We see, but we have a tremendous effort and always well with sourcing and hiring at more senior levels is really driven by the requirements and needs of our clients. And at more senior levels we also have an active recruitment underway. Just given their understanding of the various markets and the decision makers in the relationships they have. Probably be a challenge getting added that specifically, but our win rate in Q2 62% for new work and 85% for a recompete, and that is up from the beginning of year and so that coupled with how we typically [indiscernible] proposals with rate, wage increases high to our more focus for taking to account, pricing as we see it at the time when we make submission.So at this level, of my level I am very excited about our win rate performance and the topline growth of that's been able to generate. You know, is varies based upon the circumstances, we obviously take that into account as we're putting our pricing submissions and the government has been receptive to that. Welcome."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions.I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Veasey.\nNick Veasey: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's first quarter 2020 earnings announcement. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We've also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on slide 2.I'm Nick Veasey, Vice President of Investor Relations and with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.As shown on the disclaimer on slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and therefore are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results.Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our Company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer, included in our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release and in our SEC filings.We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call.During today's call, we'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. We included an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter fiscal year 2025 - sic 2020.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO Horacio Rozanski and we are on slide 5.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I are pleased to share another set of very strong quarterly results this morning. On our last earnings call just nine weeks ago, we discussed Booz Allen's outstanding fiscal year 2019 performance and highlighted that we aim to emulate that performance this fiscal year. We also increased the financial goals in our investment thesis, which takes us through fiscal year 2021, having essentially jumped a year ahead on our 3 year time horizon.In sum, we affirmed our confidence in our business going forward. We also provided clear guidance on how we plan to execute this fiscal year with a relatively aggressive first half and a more conservative second half. The operational and financial performance we have reported today aligns precisely to that plan.The fact that we are delivering on an ambitious front-loaded plan, exactly as we said we would, is further proof of the strength of our institution. We are differentiated in the market. We are effectively managing cost across the business and our people are serving clients with dedication and excellence.This morning I\u2019ll focus on these three drivers of our sustained momentum. I\u2019ll also touch on the Federal budget before handing over to Lloyd, who will run through the quarter\u2019s results and our outlook going forward.As you know, our investment thesis begins with our unique position in the market. This is the differentiation we have created by implementing our Vision 2020 growth strategy over the past six years.Clients know us today as a company that operates at the intersection of technology and mission. By coupling consulting expertise and mission knowledge with technical capability, we are helping them transform their organizations, meet today\u2019s challenges, and prepare for the future.Demand for the capabilities we have built is strong and growing and our relentless focus on innovation gives us confidence that we will be well positioned to capture rising demand.In fact, as I detailed in May, we believe demand for our services and solutions will be sustained for years to come by the global strategic environment and the ongoing digital revolution.Translating the differentiated market position into strong financial performance and value for our shareholders requires exceptional management and efficient execution across the business. Our first quarter results show that on this front, we are firing on all cylinders.Credit for the strong performance goes to all the Booz Allen leaders and our broader team who are serving clients with passion and commitment. Market leading organic revenue growth continues to translate to excellent bottom line performance. We're capturing lots of work, attracting and retaining talent, and efficiently delivering on contracts.Adjusted EBITDA margin remains very healthy and solid cash generation and strategic management of our balance sheet continues to support our capital allocation goals. In short, we\u2019re running the business with the high standards that investors and clients expect from Booz Allen, and frankly, that we demand of ourselves.Fundamentally, we\u2019re a people business. The high caliber of our work rests on their diverse expertise and the passion for working together on really tough problems. I believe that the opportunity to work in a culture that values its people and provides opportunities to make the world a better place is what draws people to our firm and keeps them here.There are many things to be proud of in our first quarter numbers, and we are especially pleased to have hit a major milestone. At the end of the first quarter Booz Allen was larger than it\u2019s ever been, with 26,384 talented professionals.It's their work across missions, industries, clients, and across the globe that quarter-after-quarter defines both who we are and how we succeed. I couldn't be more proud of the entire team as we celebrate this milestone.Getting off to a strong start is always important, but it was particularly important this year given that we were coming to the end of a 2 year budget deal. We are encouraged by the progress Congress and the administration are making towards a new 2 year budget deal.While much work remains to ensure that the federal agency funding is approved by September 30th, we are pleased that things appear to be moving in a positive direction.As it relates to Booz Allen, our leaders will continue to execute on our plan for another industry-leading fiscal year and our Q1 results have increased our confidence that we can achieve the ambitious financial goals we have set for the full year.We are also on track to deliver on the updated financial goals in our investment thesis, centered on 66% growth in earnings per share from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2021.Lloyd, let me turn the call over to you for a more in-depth look at our financial performance.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Our first quarter results have set the stage for an aggressive first half of fiscal year 2020. Our strategy is working and we are firmly on track to continue delivering industry-leading operational and financial performance.Let\u2019s go through the numbers. Please turn to slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses grew by 10.8% and 8.9% respectively compared to the first quarter last year.The increases were due to continued strength in client demand, head count growth, and slightly elevated billable expenses compared to the prior year period. Our growth remains strong and well diversified across our core US government markets.Turning to slide 7, book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.29 times and our trailing 12 month figure is 1.4 times. We continue to see a strong award environment and robust proposal activity. Total backlog as of June 30th was $19.9 billion, 16.2% higher than the prior year.Funded backlog at $3.2 billion increased by 13.7%, unfunded backlog at $4.4 billion grew 5.1%, and priced options increased 21.5% to $12.3 billion. The backlog and book-to-bill numbers again show that we are not demand constrained and they support our expectations of continued above market revenue growth.Headcount as of the end of the first quarter was a record - as Horacio mentioned, up by 1,826 or 7.4% year-over-year and by 315 since the end of March. We continue to aggressively hire to maximize our growth potential and we\u2019re on track to meet our targeted 5% headcount growth for the full fiscal year.We are encouraged by the rate at which we grew our team this quarter. We plan for an aggressive first half and our colleagues have done an incredible job hiring in the areas that are immediately impactful for our clients. It's clear that in an extremely competitive labor market, talented people want to work at Booz Allen.Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 12% compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.9%. Our strong first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by many of the same factors that drove our margin performance in fiscal year 2019, including continued strong contract performance and efficient management of our business. And as we've previously said, our adjusted EBITDA margins are also benefiting from our ongoing shift towards higher margin, technically focused work.These results show that the business is set up to translate top line growth into profit, even as we continue to invest in our business and our people. This is a strong position to be in and gives us great confidence in the future.First quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 12.7% and 12.4% respectively to $117.4 million and $117.7 million respectively, both increased primarily due to our revenue growth and higher margins.This translated to an $0.11 increase in the first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.83. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 3.6 million shares compared to one year ago.Turning to cash, we generated $51 million in operating cash for the quarter, an increase of $78 million over the same quarter last year. I am pleased that this quarter\u2019s performance was seasonally strong due to our focus on cash collections in a variety of other working capital initiatives. We remain focused on driving process improvements in areas we can control in the cash collection cycle and in coordination with our government partners.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27.3 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure and technology. This includes new, secured and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines and continued growth outside of the Washington Metro area.Please turn to slide 8. During the first quarter, we continued to execute on our disciplined, efficient capital allocation strategy that aims to deliver both near and long-term shareholder value. We returned $41 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.While our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged, we continuously evaluate all our options, consistent with our commitment to deploy the remaining $1 billion through fiscal year 2021, in line with our investment thesis, in a way that maximizes value for shareholders. The strength of our cash position and balance sheet support this commitment.Today, we are also announcing that the Company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share payable on August 30th to stockholders of record on August 14th.Lastly, I\u2019ll discuss our outlook. One quarter end, our guidance remains unchanged, as shown on slide 9. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth between 6% and 9%, adjusted EBITDA margin in the low 10%s, adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $2.90 and $3.05, and operating cash flow of $400 million to $450 million.In closing, I\u2019ll reiterate that we are extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. Booz Allen is on a strong path. The entire management team is excited about the momentum we have generated to meet our multi-year financial goals. Horacio, back to you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thanks. Lloyd. Each quarter, these goals are rightly focusing our financial performance. But we don\u2019t want to overlook another aspect of our institutional strength important to both internal and external stakeholders.So before we move to Q&A, I want to speak briefly about Booz Allen's corporate citizenship, particularly the impact we have in the communities where we operate.In fiscal year 2019, our people logged more than 88,000 hours of volunteer service for more than 900 non-profit organizations across the globe. That's roughly a 30% increase from the prior year.In addition, we as a firm continue to support many well-known organizations that assist military veterans and their families, promote STEM education, advanced healthcare, and build community resilience especially through disaster recover.Our commitment to service is deep and enduring, which is why we established and support the independent Booz Allen Foundation, even as we continue Booz Allen's own corporate citizenship programs. I am constantly inspired by the generosity and passionate service of our people. Allow me to share just a few examples.We recently became the inaugural corporate donor to the Hiring Our Heroes Military Spouse fellowship program. Our funding will send 100 spouses to six week internships that help them re-launch careers after a move or deployment. Other corporate donors are now joining the effort, which will create a strong pipeline of opportunities and sustainability for this innovative program.In May, we continued our tradition of funding the annual conference for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. TAPS supports families of those who die in the line of duty.Booz Allen provides nearly all the volunteers for National Field Day USA here in DC. This event provides a day of - an evening of care for children, while their parents receive grief counseling and mentoring.Also this spring, a team of our consultants donated their time and expertise in a pro bono project for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The project is only the latest we've done in support of the Kennedy Center and it focuses on helping them further operationalize the strategic growth plan that Booz Allen worked on a couple of years ago.Finally, I\u2019ll mention National Volunteer Month. In April, we set a big goal, in fact a firm-wide challenge of serving 5,000 volunteer hours. We easily surpassed it, recording more than 7,200 hours over 30 days.Our winning office was Fox River in Southern Maryland. Our roughly 400 colleagues there logged a remarkable 946 hours in support of several organizations, including Special Olympics, the Girl Scouts, and the Ocean Conservancy. The challenge was such a success that we are doing it again this summer, and we fully expect to outdo our April performance. There are countless other examples I could share, each demonstrates Booz Allen's purpose to empower people to change the world.So in closing, I will recognize and thank the people of this firm one more time. You define what it means to be Booz Allen through not only the impactful work you do, but also the deep care you show for the people and communities around you.With that, Nick, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.\nNick Veasey: Thanks. Shannon. Please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you and good morning, guys. Good quarter.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: You highlighted hiring would be front end loaded with the budget deal coming together. Could you maybe provide some clarity on how you think about executing on hiring throughout the remainder of the year?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Sheila, good morning. You know a couple of thoughts. First of all on the budget itself, we are cautiously optimistic because of the progress that has been made. But as you know, there is still a road ahead going from where we are now to fully appropriated dollars against all of the major agencies, hopefully by October 1st. So we continue to watch that closely, but we are optimistic that all of that will work as it should.As it relates to our hiring, I am actually very happy about the hiring, not just this quarter, but if you go and look back over the last 12 months for example, north of 7% headcount growth is actually very healthy for us and we intend that to continue. We are pedal to the metal on hiring this quarter as we said we would, and assuming conditions allow we will continue to execute strongly against our hiring for the balance of the year.We have a strong value proposition to offer talent. We\u2019re finding, even though it\u2019s a competitive market, great people to bring on to the firm and we don't intend to stop.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. And maybe just as a follow up to that Horacio, you mentioned a number of comments in your prepared remarks with regards to employee engagement. Does this make it easier to hire professionals? Do you find that your competitors do that or do they have more difficulty in adding head count?\nHoracio Rozanski: You know, I\u2019ll speak to us. I meant absolutely every word that I said, about having a culture that makes people feel valued, that makes people\u2019s passions aligned with their workday and - both at what we do with clients and the missions that we support and our entire effort moving closer to the mission, and what we do for our communities, all these part of the value proposition, that is very attractive.You know a lot can be said about millennials, my experience with millennials in particular is that they are very passionate about making a difference and they\u2019re very mission-focused.And so, I find that we can attract unique technical talent because we have this combination of a great culture, a great mission and the great engagement program both internal and external. And as I said before that we intend to continue all of that.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thanks\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Raviv with Citi. Your line is open.\nJon Raviv: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on that first question. If we do get some dollars appropriated around October 1, where do you expect that to manifest in how you're thinking about the year?Is there a chance to sort of keep on the accelerator in the second half a bit more or is it going to be an - potentially upside to growth and/or the low tens margin for the year? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Absolutely, Jon, you know certainly having a budget deal in place is beneficial to the sector and certainly to Booz Allen. We are increasingly close and getting closer to our client\u2019s mission and I see no, no let down in that. Demand is strong and as you see from our Q1 results, we\u2019re not demand constrained.As it relates to margin, we're off to a very strong start, roughly in line with what we did last year Q1 of FY'19 and we\u2019re going to continue to push forward.When we gave guidance in the low 10%s, we still believe that is where we're going to end up. It's sustainable. We're very happy to be able to sustain that level of profitability, and frankly, we remain ahead of where we thought we would be when you think about our investment thesis that we talked about probably a year ago.\nJon Raviv: And then - and then Lloyd you also mentioned that on the capital deployment front, you\u2019re always evaluating all the options for the remaining plan in terms of cash coming in, you historically tapped on M&A a bit, but can you just sort of re-evaluate or just sort of revisit what all the options are, and what kind of approaches are working versus what you might be considering going forward as the market continues to shift around?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Our capital deployment strategy, we\u2019re very pleased with it. Just to remind everyone, we are committed to a $1.4 billion capital return to maximize our shareholders over the 3 year period, and we're on track with that. We\u2019ve got a very disciplined and efficient strategy. It has four levers; share repurchases capability, tuck-ins, and regular and special dividends.We see many M&A opportunities every fiscal year. We have a strategy that we believe is working for us. And so we\u2019re always looking for assets, pure capability plays as best we can find and we'll continue to do so going forward.\nJon Raviv: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEdward Caso: Great. Good morning. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about your commercial business? In your 10-Q, it looks like it was barely up year-to-year and what the prospects and sort of what\u2019s going on underneath the covers? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey Ed, good morning. It's Horacio. The portfolio is doing well, commercial - global commercial is about 4% of our total revenue base, as you well know. It's a small business by the standards of the totality of Booz Allen.And so one or two contracts, changing dynamics will move around the number. If you look at the longer-term trend, it\u2019s been a strong growth business now growing rapidly, close to 30% for a couple of years and we are confident in the long-term prospects of our global commercial business even if from quarter-to-quarter, there will be some volatility.\nEdward Caso: Can you - and the other question is on the award activity, does it capture that large almost $1 billion VA award that got re-protested, I guess in May, and what are the prospects for the September quarter. Do you sense a typical loss spike up? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Our backlog has - it has always been, it\u2019s very conservative. It does not capture that VA award that's under protest. And as far as looking forward, typically for those of you who have looked at us, there is seasonality to our backlog that closely mirrors the government fiscal year.\nHoracio Rozanski: I just want to put on something that Lloyd said before. We\u2019re very pleased with the market. We are not demand constrained. Our growth prospects are, at this point, largely driven by our willingness and ability to attract and absorb the right kind of people to give a sustainable growth and that\u2019s what we're focused on. The book-to-bill number of this quarter shows it, but more broadly, we are winning in the market in the places where we really want to win.\nEdward Caso: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Morning.\nGavin Parsons: Demand now being - or growth now being demand constrained being a big subject, just wanted to maybe get at the kind of customer environment and sentiment, budget deal or not, a lot of your hardware peers have been talking about accelerated demand pulled forward contracts.So I wanted to maybe get your sense of whether or not there's just more confidence in just kind of the general budget environment from a customer whether deal or no deal if they feel more confident in adding of on-contract growth or exercising options or spending money.\nHoracio Rozanski: So, the dynamic, I'll begin and I am sure Lloyd will want to add. The dynamic that I see is one where now for, frankly more than a couple of years, there has been funding in the system to invest in critical capabilities.At the year end earnings call, I talked about the dynamics around great power competition and how that was shifting the defense investment priorities more broadly across the government, how the digital revolution was coming into the federal government and driving significant change.And those are, to us, the underlying drivers of demand. And that's why we don't feel we're demand constrained close to our client's missions. This type of work is and will continue to be in high demand.Obviously budget stability and budget certainty accelerates that, improves that, makes it less choppy and gives our clients the confidence to plan even longer term. But if you look at our numbers, it talks about the - what's in the Q. Our defense business, our civil business, both growing around 13% this quarter. Our national security business also, great deal of demand. Obviously the supply constrain is there, because of the classification issue are the greatest, but a very strong showing and the strong potential to continue.\nLloyd Howell: And I\u2019d just add that when you look at our backlog performance. Our latest - our trailing-12 months book-to-bill at 1.4 and then for the quarter at 1.29 times, really I think, speaks to the environment that we\u2019re working in.We got a strong start to the summer selling season. We\u2019ve got a record Q1 backlog totals up 16% and fund is up also by a healthy amount of 14%.\nGavin Parsons: Great. And then Horacio, maybe if you could talk a little bit about just the current state of AI investment in the government, where you think that could be in five to ten years and what Booz is doing to position for that? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you for that question. So let me start that, I talked before about, for example, let's start with DoD and great power competition, I think it\u2019s been widely reported that our competitors, for lack of a better term, are investing heavily in technology and AI is one of those areas.China is on the record [Technical Difficulty] We were investing ahead time on that for the last two or three years, but in the last year to 18 months, the notion of artificial intelligence, algorithmic warfare, machine learning has exploded throughout the federal government in terms of need.If you talk about defense that's there, but if you talk about other parts of the government, think about parts of the government that need to seasonally stand up with very large call centers and then they bring them down when the season ends, those are areas that are right for machine intelligence to actually accelerate the opportunity and we are very well positioned because of the investments that we're making not just in talent, which are quite significant, but also in building platforms and architectures that will allow us to monetize our intellectual capital in different ways as part of what we talk about as option value that have me very encouraged.AI is going to be a multi-billion dollar area of investment for the Federal government going forward and Booz Allen is and wants to be at the center of that.\nGavin Parsons: Great. Thanks very much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So at your Investor Day, when you laid out your three-year goals, you talked of improving profitability and a mix shift toward more fixed price business and yet your fixed price was down and your cost-plus business was up very strongly in the first half, and yet you delivered very satisfactory profitability and maybe explain why that happened?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure, Cai. This has been an effort for some time that's been underway and what we believe we're seeing is all that hard work by our team is really paying off. We see the margin performance really resulting from three factors.One being strong contract performance. We\u2019re also managing the business more efficiently than ever and we continue to shift our capabilities and the work that we\u2019re providing toward technically focused type of work. The combination of that certainly kicked in last fiscal year and we believe is sustainable this fiscal year.So we see our larger performance still being in low 10%s. We\u2019re very happy to have that profitability, and then also 10% at the top line and we believe that we can remain in that postures throughout the rest of the year.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you. And so, normally in the past, you haven't hired as aggressively as you have now in the first quarter and you tend to hire more in the second half with associated pressure on the margins.What\u2019s your plan for this year? I mean you've talked about near term continuing to be aggressive, but do you feel there is likely to be enough business that we could see another 7% plus headcount lift in the fourth quarter or are things likely to sort of decelerate a bit? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, for this year. The story actually started in the fourth quarter of last year. If you look back at Q4, you will see that we had a positive net hiring quarter and that momentum certainly flowed into Q1 of this year.Horacio and I've always maintain that we want to consistently hire and deploy our strong candidate across the business and we feel that we're off to a great start. And then if you refer back to our prepared remarks as well as Horacio's previous comments, we're not demand constrained and we've had our foot on the accelerator when it comes to talent for quite some time and we expect that to continue.At the beginning of the year we forecasted 5%. It is what we're shooting for. We\u2019re off to a good start, and at the moment that still remains our target.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Carter.\nCarter Copeland: Just one quick follow-up on that capital deployment discussion. I know you highlighted all the levers, Lloyd. But - I also just sort of gone through the numbers in the Q. The share repurchase is very minimal, and I wondered, do you think back to the levers you talked about, is there any purposeful about that or is this the normal sort of ebbs and flows in how you see your various capital deployment opportunities? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure. I mean we are always looking to maximize shareholder value, given what the market presents to us Carter, and I would say the ebbs and flows of the market and still with an eye toward how do we maximize shareholder value.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with SunTrust. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. So just wanted to ask a question about your long-term growth and kind of differentiated, be able to have - hiring to pockets of future demand such as AI and machine learning that you've talked about already.Is there anything, like a change in the market that would triggering you to press those investments more now and are there any new areas that you see on the horizon that you could add to beyond the themes and pockets that we've discussed already?\nHoracio Rozanski: I ask myself that question all the time and I think the answer has to be, yes. I look at the market, and from our perspective, you want to drive differentiation uniqueness in the market from a position of strength, and that's where we are now.We\u2019re in this pay off period provision 2020. We are where we want to be one quarter into a fiscal year and we're driving across all fronts. We have an innovation agenda that is very robust. It began six or seven years ago before innovation was cool and we have been driving it relentlessly and it\u2019s got a pipeline. It's got certain things that are already deployed. We've talked about those in the past, like recreation.gov, like District Defend.We have other things that are a little bit upstream like some of our solutions work around AI and things that are further upstream and will continue to be, but our goal. This is why we don't talk about these things individually. We talk about them as a portfolio. Our goal is to drive that portfolio to create both unique, differentiated revenue a unique story around Booz Allen with our clients as the combination of these platforms and our talent create solutions and ultimately unique and differentiated financial performance because we believe that these investments actually carry the potential for much higher margin and high profitability.So that's our goal. We're at it -- we're at it every quarter. We're accelerating as much as we can. These things take time and we're going to take the time that's necessary.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. As you look at your business in sort of from a civil and defense perspective, are you seeing a different cadence in tempo to award activity in business wins and I ask that in the context of, just looking at simple treasury outlays and seeing that defense is tracking ahead of civil and wondering whether that's manifesting itself in your business?\nHoracio Rozanski: I honestly don't see it at that level. We see very robust demand across the board, lots of great opportunities, and it's a question of positioning for the right ones, and the definition of the right ones are the ones not just that we can win, but the ones that give us the kinds of economics that Lloyd was talking about before.And most importantly, the ones that leverage our differentiation, so that these are sustainable wins, where we win not just a new work but the re-competes after that.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good Morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Horacio, on the back of that and we talk about this every quarter, but you\u2019ve had outstanding growth here. The backlog expansion is tremendous. It sounds like Lloyd's looking for another strong September bookings quarter.Could you - could we probe a little bit into what that differentiation is or at least the parts that actually translate into sector high backlog and revenue growth? Obviously you guys see yourself as best in class and the number support that, but can we get a little more tangible here, why are you outpacing the others?\nHoracio Rozanski: I\u2019ll speak about us and why do I think we are winning. You know, I am out talking to clients regularly and our conversation with our clients is about what are their major opportunities to drive mission in a different way, and to use technology to accelerate and at times leapfrog where they are on their mission.And that conversation tends to lead to things that haven't been done before and that's frankly where we excel, when we bring a capability that might have worked elsewhere, port it over to a place that hasn't seen it before or completely re-imagine a mission based on leveraging a new capability.We're doing, for example, some recruiting work or one of the mode there, services, and we're bringing our open source understandings to help them understand what is the tenor and the tone in a local market of how potential recruits are looking at that service. That is the kind of thing that is unique to us that we bring together that I don't - I assume others don't because we win work like that regularly and that fuels our growth.And again I think that's what makes it sustainable. What makes it sustainable is that we're not going to rest in our laurels, is that we never compete for a re-compete with the same proposal we had five years earlier. It's a new approach, a new thinking to push the mission forward.And frankly by the way, in a supply constrained environment, that is what excites people and I honestly think that's what brings and keeps people here. It\u2019s the opportunity to not just to work in these great missions, but actually to advance them.\nRobert Spingarn: So you talk about that being sustainable. So really brings up the next part of the question, which is, while we do have some visibility here from a 2021 budget. The second half of that budget is kind of flat. When we look at the FYDP and we look at the O&M, it is kind of flattish from here on out.And so how do you think about your longer-term growth opportunity in a flattening budget or, again, if we go back to what you just said, the end market growth really doesn't necessarily drive your growth?\nHoracio Rozanski: You know, we outgrow the market for as long as I can remember. So what\u2019s really important to us is our clients having a reasonable level of certainty about their ability to invest because then we can win work.And we will take share in the course of doing that as we always have. I mean like I said, we've always outpaced the market and we intend to continuing to do that.\nRobert Spingarn: And last thing is, are there a couple of major contracts we should be on the lookout for as we progress through the fiscal year?\nHoracio Rozanski: We don't talk about individual contracts on this call, when we talk about the entirety of the portfolio, because our portfolio is constructed such that no single contract actually drives the future of the firm.So look across all of it, look at the kinds of wins that we\u2019re having and to the extent that you can ask questions about what is that we're not just the size of it, because I think that's what drives our uniqueness and our sustainability.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Horacio, I guess you sound a little bit more cautious than optimistic in terms of the budget outlook. So can you just talk a little bit about what some of the risks are over the next few months that you're kind of monitoring? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I mean, I don't claim to have a crystal ball around any of these. I am out talking to clients. I'm up on the hill, trying to understand how people are thinking about it and talking to experts who've lived in that world for a lot longer than we have. And it\u2019s a complex process that can be -- that can have hiccups along the way.Think about last year there was a budget - there was a budget deal, there was everything else and then there was -- come January a shutdown. I don't expect that to happen this year. I don't - I am optimistic that all of the positive momentum will translate, but we're looking at it very closely.And as it relates to us, this is why we are running the year the way we are, very strong first quarter, hopefully a very strong first half, so that if things are great in the second half we'll continue on and if there is turbulence, we will be well prepared to deal with it.\nJoseph DeNardi: Got it. And then just lastly, is there any update kind of on District Defend or some of the other opportunities you guys talked about as part of your option value investment strategy and then anything on the legal front to update us on? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: No updates on the legal front. We continue to work with the government, and that process is ongoing. As it relates to our option value portfolio, the portfolio is moving forward. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, any part of that portfolio could actually be a real needle mover for the firm in the medium to long-term, and we don't expect every part of the portfolio to succeed.But we\u2019re investing, we\u2019re managing it very closely, and I'm actually very excited about the progress that we're making on all fronts.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim McHugh with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTim McHugh: Thanks. Most of mine have been answered or asked, but just wanted to follow-up on the contract mix type. There is been a gradual trend and then a more meaningful step towards cost reimbursable, I guess as part of the mix, this quarter. I guess you were asked earlier about the margin. I just wanted to ask, I guess, what's driving that mix shift. Is that a particular part of your client base or type of work you're doing that's driving that mix shift? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Yeah. Tim, it's sort of an outcome of a variety of factors, our defense part of our portfolio has been having a strong performance. And as you may be aware of any of the contract size - saw from the contract size in that market, our cost plus and timely materials and from our analysis, that's what's contributed to the modest shift.\nTim McHugh: Okay. Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, everyone. Thanks for your time, for the dialog and for your questions this morning. Our firm, as you can tell, is off to another great start this fiscal year and the pay off period for Vision 2020 continues. So on behalf of the people at Booz Allen, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and confidence. We are forging ahead with excitement about the future, especially about the positive difference we can make in the world and in our communities. Have a great day and enjoy the rest of the summer.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I are pleased to share another set of very strong quarterly results this morning. On our last earnings call just nine weeks ago, we discussed Booz Allen's outstanding fiscal year 2019 performance and highlighted that we aim to emulate that performance this fiscal year. We also increased the financial goals in our investment thesis, which takes us through fiscal year 2021, having essentially jumped a year ahead on our 3 year time horizon.In sum, we affirmed our confidence in our business going forward. We also provided clear guidance on how we plan to execute this fiscal year with a relatively aggressive first half and a more conservative second half. The operational and financial performance we have reported today aligns precisely to that plan.The fact that we are delivering on an ambitious front-loaded plan, exactly as we said we would, is further proof of the strength of our institution. We are differentiated in the market. We are effectively managing cost across the business and our people are serving clients with dedication and excellence.This morning I'll focus on these three drivers of our sustained momentum. I'll also touch on the Federal budget before handing over to Lloyd, who will run through the quarter's results and our outlook going forward.As you know, our investment thesis begins with our unique position in the market. This is the differentiation we have created by implementing our Vision 2020 growth strategy over the past six years.Clients know us today as a company that operates at the intersection of technology and mission. By coupling consulting expertise and mission knowledge with technical capability, we are helping them transform their organizations, meet today's challenges, and prepare for the future.Demand for the capabilities we have built is strong and growing and our relentless focus on innovation gives us confidence that we will be well positioned to capture rising demand.In fact, as I detailed in May, we believe demand for our services and solutions will be sustained for years to come by the global strategic environment and the ongoing digital revolution.Translating the differentiated market position into strong financial performance and value for our shareholders requires exceptional management and efficient execution across the business. Our first quarter results show that on this front, we are firing on all cylinders.Credit for the strong performance goes to all the Booz Allen leaders and our broader team who are serving clients with passion and commitment. Market leading organic revenue growth continues to translate to excellent bottom line performance. We're capturing lots of work, attracting and retaining talent, and efficiently delivering on contracts.Adjusted EBITDA margin remains very healthy and solid cash generation and strategic management of our balance sheet continues to support our capital allocation goals. In short, we're running the business with the high standards that investors and clients expect from Booz Allen, and frankly, that we demand of ourselves.Fundamentally, we're a people business. The high caliber of our work rests on their diverse expertise and the passion for working together on really tough problems. I believe that the opportunity to work in a culture that values its people and provides opportunities to make the world a better place is what draws people to our firm and keeps them here.There are many things to be proud of in our first quarter numbers, and we are especially pleased to have hit a major milestone. At the end of the first quarter Booz Allen was larger than it's ever been, with 26,384 talented professionals.It's their work across missions, industries, clients, and across the globe that quarter-after-quarter defines both who we are and how we succeed. I couldn't be more proud of the entire team as we celebrate this milestone.Getting off to a strong start is always important, but it was particularly important this year given that we were coming to the end of a 2 year budget deal. We are encouraged by the progress Congress and the administration are making towards a new 2 year budget deal.While much work remains to ensure that the federal agency funding is approved by September 30th, we are pleased that things appear to be moving in a positive direction.As it relates to Booz Allen, our leaders will continue to execute on our plan for another industry-leading fiscal year and our Q1 results have increased our confidence that we can achieve the ambitious financial goals we have set for the full year.We are also on track to deliver on the updated financial goals in our investment thesis, centered on 66% growth in earnings per share from fiscal year 2018 through fiscal year 2021.Lloyd, let me turn the call over to you for a more in-depth look at our financial performance. Thanks. Lloyd. Each quarter, these goals are rightly focusing our financial performance. But we don't want to overlook another aspect of our institutional strength important to both internal and external stakeholders.So before we move to Q&A, I want to speak briefly about Booz Allen's corporate citizenship, particularly the impact we have in the communities where we operate.In fiscal year 2019, our people logged more than 88,000 hours of volunteer service for more than 900 non-profit organizations across the globe. That's roughly a 30% increase from the prior year.In addition, we as a firm continue to support many well-known organizations that assist military veterans and their families, promote STEM education, advanced healthcare, and build community resilience especially through disaster recover.Our commitment to service is deep and enduring, which is why we established and support the independent Booz Allen Foundation, even as we continue Booz Allen's own corporate citizenship programs. I am constantly inspired by the generosity and passionate service of our people. Allow me to share just a few examples.We recently became the inaugural corporate donor to the Hiring Our Heroes Military Spouse fellowship program. Our funding will send 100 spouses to six week internships that help them re-launch careers after a move or deployment. Other corporate donors are now joining the effort, which will create a strong pipeline of opportunities and sustainability for this innovative program.In May, we continued our tradition of funding the annual conference for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. TAPS supports families of those who die in the line of duty.Booz Allen provides nearly all the volunteers for National Field Day USA here in DC. This event provides a day of - an evening of care for children, while their parents receive grief counseling and mentoring.Also this spring, a team of our consultants donated their time and expertise in a pro bono project for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The project is only the latest we've done in support of the Kennedy Center and it focuses on helping them further operationalize the strategic growth plan that Booz Allen worked on a couple of years ago.Finally, I'll mention National Volunteer Month. In April, we set a big goal, in fact a firm-wide challenge of serving 5,000 volunteer hours. We easily surpassed it, recording more than 7,200 hours over 30 days.Our winning office was Fox River in Southern Maryland. Our roughly 400 colleagues there logged a remarkable 946 hours in support of several organizations, including Special Olympics, the Girl Scouts, and the Ocean Conservancy. The challenge was such a success that we are doing it again this summer, and we fully expect to outdo our April performance. There are countless other examples I could share, each demonstrates Booz Allen's purpose to empower people to change the world.So in closing, I will recognize and thank the people of this firm one more time. You define what it means to be Booz Allen through not only the impactful work you do, but also the deep care you show for the people and communities around you.With that, Nick, let's open the lines for questions. Thank you. Sure. Sheila, good morning. You know a couple of thoughts. First of all on the budget itself, we are cautiously optimistic because of the progress that has been made. But as you know, there is still a road ahead going from where we are now to fully appropriated dollars against all of the major agencies, hopefully by October 1st. So we continue to watch that closely, but we are optimistic that all of that will work as it should.As it relates to our hiring, I am actually very happy about the hiring, not just this quarter, but if you go and look back over the last 12 months for example, north of 7% headcount growth is actually very healthy for us and we intend that to continue. We are pedal to the metal on hiring this quarter as we said we would, and assuming conditions allow we will continue to execute strongly against our hiring for the balance of the year.We have a strong value proposition to offer talent. We're finding, even though it's a competitive market, great people to bring on to the firm and we don't intend to stop. You know, I'll speak to us. I meant absolutely every word that I said, about having a culture that makes people feel valued, that makes people's passions aligned with their workday and - both at what we do with clients and the missions that we support and our entire effort moving closer to the mission, and what we do for our communities, all these part of the value proposition, that is very attractive.You know a lot can be said about millennials, my experience with millennials in particular is that they are very passionate about making a difference and they're very mission-focused.And so, I find that we can attract unique technical talent because we have this combination of a great culture, a great mission and the great engagement program both internal and external. And as I said before that we intend to continue all of that. Sure. Absolutely, Jon, you know certainly having a budget deal in place is beneficial to the sector and certainly to Booz Allen. We are increasingly close and getting closer to our client's mission and I see no, no let down in that. Demand is strong and as you see from our Q1 results, we're not demand constrained.As it relates to margin, we're off to a very strong start, roughly in line with what we did last year Q1 of FY'19 and we're going to continue to push forward.When we gave guidance in the low 10%s, we still believe that is where we're going to end up. It's sustainable. We're very happy to be able to sustain that level of profitability, and frankly, we remain ahead of where we thought we would be when you think about our investment thesis that we talked about probably a year ago. Sure. Our capital deployment strategy, we're very pleased with it. Just to remind everyone, we are committed to a $1.4 billion capital return to maximize our shareholders over the 3 year period, and we're on track with that. We've got a very disciplined and efficient strategy. It has four levers; share repurchases capability, tuck-ins, and regular and special dividends.We see many M&A opportunities every fiscal year. We have a strategy that we believe is working for us. And so we're always looking for assets, pure capability plays as best we can find and we'll continue to do so going forward. Hey Ed, good morning. It's Horacio. The portfolio is doing well, commercial - global commercial is about 4% of our total revenue base, as you well know. It's a small business by the standards of the totality of Booz Allen.And so one or two contracts, changing dynamics will move around the number. If you look at the longer-term trend, it's been a strong growth business now growing rapidly, close to 30% for a couple of years and we are confident in the long-term prospects of our global commercial business even if from quarter-to-quarter, there will be some volatility. I just want to put on something that Lloyd said before. We're very pleased with the market. We are not demand constrained. Our growth prospects are, at this point, largely driven by our willingness and ability to attract and absorb the right kind of people to give a sustainable growth and that's what we're focused on. The book-to-bill number of this quarter shows it, but more broadly, we are winning in the market in the places where we really want to win. Morning. So, the dynamic, I'll begin and I am sure Lloyd will want to add. The dynamic that I see is one where now for, frankly more than a couple of years, there has been funding in the system to invest in critical capabilities.At the year end earnings call, I talked about the dynamics around great power competition and how that was shifting the defense investment priorities more broadly across the government, how the digital revolution was coming into the federal government and driving significant change.And those are, to us, the underlying drivers of demand. And that's why we don't feel we're demand constrained close to our client's missions. This type of work is and will continue to be in high demand.Obviously budget stability and budget certainty accelerates that, improves that, makes it less choppy and gives our clients the confidence to plan even longer term. But if you look at our numbers, it talks about the - what's in the Q. Our defense business, our civil business, both growing around 13% this quarter. Our national security business also, great deal of demand. Obviously the supply constrain is there, because of the classification issue are the greatest, but a very strong showing and the strong potential to continue. Thank you for that question. So let me start that, I talked before about, for example, let's start with DoD and great power competition, I think it's been widely reported that our competitors, for lack of a better term, are investing heavily in technology and AI is one of those areas.China is on the record [Technical Difficulty] We were investing ahead time on that for the last two or three years, but in the last year to 18 months, the notion of artificial intelligence, algorithmic warfare, machine learning has exploded throughout the federal government in terms of need.If you talk about defense that's there, but if you talk about other parts of the government, think about parts of the government that need to seasonally stand up with very large call centers and then they bring them down when the season ends, those are areas that are right for machine intelligence to actually accelerate the opportunity and we are very well positioned because of the investments that we're making not just in talent, which are quite significant, but also in building platforms and architectures that will allow us to monetize our intellectual capital in different ways as part of what we talk about as option value that have me very encouraged.AI is going to be a multi-billion dollar area of investment for the Federal government going forward and Booz Allen is and wants to be at the center of that. Thank you. Sure, Cai. This has been an effort for some time that's been underway and what we believe we're seeing is all that hard work by our team is really paying off. We see the margin performance really resulting from three factors.One being strong contract performance. We're also managing the business more efficiently than ever and we continue to shift our capabilities and the work that we're providing toward technically focused type of work. The combination of that certainly kicked in last fiscal year and we believe is sustainable this fiscal year.So we see our larger performance still being in low 10%s. We're very happy to have that profitability, and then also 10% at the top line and we believe that we can remain in that postures throughout the rest of the year. Well, for this year. The story actually started in the fourth quarter of last year. If you look back at Q4, you will see that we had a positive net hiring quarter and that momentum certainly flowed into Q1 of this year.Horacio and I've always maintain that we want to consistently hire and deploy our strong candidate across the business and we feel that we're off to a great start. And then if you refer back to our prepared remarks as well as Horacio's previous comments, we're not demand constrained and we've had our foot on the accelerator when it comes to talent for quite some time and we expect that to continue.At the beginning of the year we forecasted 5%. It is what we're shooting for. We're off to a good start, and at the moment that still remains our target. Hey, Carter. I ask myself that question all the time and I think the answer has to be, yes. I look at the market, and from our perspective, you want to drive differentiation uniqueness in the market from a position of strength, and that's where we are now.We're in this pay off period provision 2020. We are where we want to be one quarter into a fiscal year and we're driving across all fronts. We have an innovation agenda that is very robust. It began six or seven years ago before innovation was cool and we have been driving it relentlessly and it's got a pipeline. It's got certain things that are already deployed. We've talked about those in the past, like recreation.gov, like District Defend.We have other things that are a little bit upstream like some of our solutions work around AI and things that are further upstream and will continue to be, but our goal. This is why we don't talk about these things individually. We talk about them as a portfolio. Our goal is to drive that portfolio to create both unique, differentiated revenue a unique story around Booz Allen with our clients as the combination of these platforms and our talent create solutions and ultimately unique and differentiated financial performance because we believe that these investments actually carry the potential for much higher margin and high profitability.So that's our goal. We're at it -- we're at it every quarter. We're accelerating as much as we can. These things take time and we're going to take the time that's necessary. I honestly don't see it at that level. We see very robust demand across the board, lots of great opportunities, and it's a question of positioning for the right ones, and the definition of the right ones are the ones not just that we can win, but the ones that give us the kinds of economics that Lloyd was talking about before.And most importantly, the ones that leverage our differentiation, so that these are sustainable wins, where we win not just a new work but the re-competes after that. Good Morning. I'll speak about us and why do I think we are winning. You know, I am out talking to clients regularly and our conversation with our clients is about what are their major opportunities to drive mission in a different way, and to use technology to accelerate and at times leapfrog where they are on their mission.And that conversation tends to lead to things that haven't been done before and that's frankly where we excel, when we bring a capability that might have worked elsewhere, port it over to a place that hasn't seen it before or completely re-imagine a mission based on leveraging a new capability.We're doing, for example, some recruiting work or one of the mode there, services, and we're bringing our open source understandings to help them understand what is the tenor and the tone in a local market of how potential recruits are looking at that service. That is the kind of thing that is unique to us that we bring together that I don't - I assume others don't because we win work like that regularly and that fuels our growth.And again I think that's what makes it sustainable. What makes it sustainable is that we're not going to rest in our laurels, is that we never compete for a re-compete with the same proposal we had five years earlier. It's a new approach, a new thinking to push the mission forward.And frankly by the way, in a supply constrained environment, that is what excites people and I honestly think that's what brings and keeps people here. It's the opportunity to not just to work in these great missions, but actually to advance them. You know, we outgrow the market for as long as I can remember. So what's really important to us is our clients having a reasonable level of certainty about their ability to invest because then we can win work.And we will take share in the course of doing that as we always have. I mean like I said, we've always outpaced the market and we intend to continuing to do that. We don't talk about individual contracts on this call, when we talk about the entirety of the portfolio, because our portfolio is constructed such that no single contract actually drives the future of the firm.So look across all of it, look at the kinds of wins that we're having and to the extent that you can ask questions about what is that we're not just the size of it, because I think that's what drives our uniqueness and our sustainability. Thank you. Sure. I mean, I don't claim to have a crystal ball around any of these. I am out talking to clients. I'm up on the hill, trying to understand how people are thinking about it and talking to experts who've lived in that world for a lot longer than we have. And it's a complex process that can be -- that can have hiccups along the way.Think about last year there was a budget - there was a budget deal, there was everything else and then there was -- come January a shutdown. I don't expect that to happen this year. I don't - I am optimistic that all of the positive momentum will translate, but we're looking at it very closely.And as it relates to us, this is why we are running the year the way we are, very strong first quarter, hopefully a very strong first half, so that if things are great in the second half we'll continue on and if there is turbulence, we will be well prepared to deal with it. No updates on the legal front. We continue to work with the government, and that process is ongoing. As it relates to our option value portfolio, the portfolio is moving forward. As I've said repeatedly, any part of that portfolio could actually be a real needle mover for the firm in the medium to long-term, and we don't expect every part of the portfolio to succeed.But we're investing, we're managing it very closely, and I'm actually very excited about the progress that we're making on all fronts. Thank you, everyone. Thanks for your time, for the dialog and for your questions this morning. Our firm, as you can tell, is off to another great start this fiscal year and the pay off period for Vision 2020 continues. So on behalf of the people at Booz Allen, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and confidence. We are forging ahead with excitement about the future, especially about the positive difference we can make in the world and in our communities. Have a great day and enjoy the rest of the summer."

            "content": "Thanks, Horacio. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. Our first quarter results have set the stage for an aggressive first half of fiscal year 2020. Our strategy is working and we are firmly on track to continue delivering industry-leading operational and financial performance.Let's go through the numbers. Please turn to slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses grew by 10.8% and 8.9% respectively compared to the first quarter last year.The increases were due to continued strength in client demand, head count growth, and slightly elevated billable expenses compared to the prior year period. Our growth remains strong and well diversified across our core US government markets.Turning to slide 7, book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.29 times and our trailing 12 month figure is 1.4 times. We continue to see a strong award environment and robust proposal activity. Total backlog as of June 30th was $19.9 billion, 16.2% higher than the prior year.Funded backlog at $3.2 billion increased by 13.7%, unfunded backlog at $4.4 billion grew 5.1%, and priced options increased 21.5% to $12.3 billion. The backlog and book-to-bill numbers again show that we are not demand constrained and they support our expectations of continued above market revenue growth.Headcount as of the end of the first quarter was a record - as Horacio mentioned, up by 1,826 or 7.4% year-over-year and by 315 since the end of March. We continue to aggressively hire to maximize our growth potential and we're on track to meet our targeted 5% headcount growth for the full fiscal year.We are encouraged by the rate at which we grew our team this quarter. We plan for an aggressive first half and our colleagues have done an incredible job hiring in the areas that are immediately impactful for our clients. It's clear that in an extremely competitive labor market, talented people want to work at Booz Allen.Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $199 million, up 12% compared to last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 10.9%. Our strong first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by many of the same factors that drove our margin performance in fiscal year 2019, including continued strong contract performance and efficient management of our business. And as we've previously said, our adjusted EBITDA margins are also benefiting from our ongoing shift towards higher margin, technically focused work.These results show that the business is set up to translate top line growth into profit, even as we continue to invest in our business and our people. This is a strong position to be in and gives us great confidence in the future.First quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 12.7% and 12.4% respectively to $117.4 million and $117.7 million respectively, both increased primarily due to our revenue growth and higher margins.This translated to an $0.11 increase in the first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share to $0.83. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding declined 3.6 million shares compared to one year ago.Turning to cash, we generated $51 million in operating cash for the quarter, an increase of $78 million over the same quarter last year. I am pleased that this quarter's performance was seasonally strong due to our focus on cash collections in a variety of other working capital initiatives. We remain focused on driving process improvements in areas we can control in the cash collection cycle and in coordination with our government partners.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27.3 million as we continue to invest in facilities, infrastructure and technology. This includes new, secured and retrofitted space and technology to support an increasingly technical workforce, new business lines and continued growth outside of the Washington Metro area.Please turn to slide 8. During the first quarter, we continued to execute on our disciplined, efficient capital allocation strategy that aims to deliver both near and long-term shareholder value. We returned $41 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.While our capital deployment priorities remain unchanged, we continuously evaluate all our options, consistent with our commitment to deploy the remaining $1 billion through fiscal year 2021, in line with our investment thesis, in a way that maximizes value for shareholders. The strength of our cash position and balance sheet support this commitment.Today, we are also announcing that the Company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share payable on August 30th to stockholders of record on August 14th.Lastly, I'll discuss our outlook. One quarter end, our guidance remains unchanged, as shown on slide 9. For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth between 6% and 9%, adjusted EBITDA margin in the low 10%s, adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $2.90 and $3.05, and operating cash flow of $400 million to $450 million.In closing, I'll reiterate that we are extremely pleased with our first quarter performance. Booz Allen is on a strong path. The entire management team is excited about the momentum we have generated to meet our multi-year financial goals. Horacio, back to you. Sure. Our backlog has - it has always been, it's very conservative. It does not capture that VA award that's under protest. And as far as looking forward, typically for those of you who have looked at us, there is seasonality to our backlog that closely mirrors the government fiscal year. And I'd just add that when you look at our backlog performance. Our latest - our trailing-12 months book-to-bill at 1.4 and then for the quarter at 1.29 times, really I think, speaks to the environment that we're working in.We got a strong start to the summer selling season. We've got a record Q1 backlog totals up 16% and fund is up also by a healthy amount of 14%. Sure. I mean we are always looking to maximize shareholder value, given what the market presents to us Carter, and I would say the ebbs and flows of the market and still with an eye toward how do we maximize shareholder value. Yeah. Tim, it's sort of an outcome of a variety of factors, our defense part of our portfolio has been having a strong performance. And as you may be aware of any of the contract size - saw from the contract size in that market, our cost plus and timely materials and from our analysis, that's what's contributed to the modest shift. Sure."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Booz Allen Hamilton's earnings call covering fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2021. [Operator Instructions] \n I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rubun Dey. \nRubun Dey: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 earnings announcement. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. \n I'm Rubun Dey, Head of Investor Relations. And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. \n As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and, therefore, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer included in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today, and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call. \n During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2021 slides. \n It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 5. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Rubun, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I are proud to announce Booz Allen's results for fiscal year 2021 this morning, another stellar performance by the people of our firm. \n The past year was unlike any other in this company's 107-year history. That's simple fact. And all the complexity it sums up makes the results we are reporting this morning all the more impressive. But before diving into our latest results and our outlook for the current year, I want to highlight that the fiscal year-end on March 31 also marked the close of the 3-year period covered in our investment thesis. \n When we first shared our thesis in June of 2018, we committed to 50% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over 3 years. We said that growth would be driven by our unique position in the market and the combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and robust capital deployment. With our fiscal year 2021 results now final, Booz Allen has significantly exceeded our 3-year financial objectives. \n ADEPS nearly doubled over the period to $3.90 in fiscal year 2021. Average annual revenue growth was above the midpoint of the 6% to 9% range we originally provided. Adjusted EBITDA margin was above 10% in each of the 3 years. And we deployed $1.3 billion in capital, the majority of which was achieved through increased dividends and a robust share repurchase program. \n During the 3-year period, we navigated through significant budget uncertainty, including the longest government shutdown we've ever experienced, a turbulent presidential transition period and a once-in-a-century pandemic. And throughout, we continued to invest in our people, especially when we set aside $100 million in response to the pandemic to support our employees and help the most vulnerable in our communities. All the while, we also continued to invest in our key technologies and develop elements of our option value portfolio. \n So the story over the last 3 years is certainly about outstanding financial performance. But more importantly, as we look to the future, it is the basis for our optimistic outlook on the business. Over the last decade, we further differentiated Booz Allen's brand and market position to the point that today, federal and commercial clients rely on us for advanced technology solutions that deliver both speed and mission scale. And our unique combination of consulting expertise, mission knowledge, innovation and technology serves as a strategic accelerator for both our firm and our clients. \n I've said many times, Booz Allen learns and evolves continuously. Our next strategy and long-term financial outlook, which we plan to share with you in the fall, will build on Vision 2020's growth and transformation. We are very comfortable with our direction of travel as we anticipate the opportunities of the next decade. \n The most recent example of our confidence in our strategic direction is our agreement to acquire Liberty IT Solutions, LLC. As we discussed when we announced it on May 4, this acquisition is directly on strategy. Liberty is an exceptional company with highly skilled talent, trusted client relationships, closeness to mission, a solid growth trajectory and digital transformation capabilities that augment Booz Allen's extensive set of offerings. The transaction is expected to close in this quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. And we look forward to officially welcoming the Liberty team to the Booz Allen Family. \n Let's turn now to the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year financial results released this morning. Lloyd and I are proud of the team's performance in an unprecedented year. On all metrics, we have met or exceeded the updated guidance we provided at the end of January. \n For the full year, organic revenue growth was strong, albeit slower than recent years due to the pandemic and some delays in funding and awards after the election. We also delivered excellent bottom line results. Full year earnings, profit margins and cash flow are all ahead of expectations. And as the market began to stabilize post transition, our team did a great job in capturing opportunities, driving a record book-to-bill in the fourth quarter and year-end backlog of $24 billion. \n Underlying demand for our services and solutions remain robust, with our defense and civil businesses delivering excellent organic growth in fiscal year 2021, while intelligence and global commercial continue to reshape their portfolios. Lloyd will go into greater depth about market dynamics in a few minutes. \n Next, I am pleased to report that the Department of Justice has closed the criminal investigation that we first disclosed in June 2017. The civil DOJ and SEC investigations remain pending. And we continue to cooperate with the government to bring those matters to an appropriate resolution. \n Let's shift now to how we are thinking about the business in the year ahead. As we open fiscal year 2022, we are very focused on a set of near and midterm priorities. First and foremost, to fully benefit from our strong backlog and demand pipeline, we need to accelerate our recruiting efforts. Second, we must capitalize on the reshaped portfolios in intelligence and commercial to drive growth in both businesses. Third, we will carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment by investing in our people and the advanced capabilities we need for the future. Fourth, having launched our next-generation financial system on April 1, we are making strong progress, and we'll keep focused on a seamless implementation. And fifth, upon close of the Liberty acquisition, we will work closely together on a smooth and successful integration. \n As we look further out, we're also focused on positioning for growth beyond the current fiscal year. Our overriding goal is to accelerate into the next wave of changes in our market, from monetizing the option value portfolio; to investing in new areas like low-code, 5G, AI or quantum; to finalizing our strategic review. Booz Allen is committed to being a leader in ensuring our clients can scale new technologies into their missions faster than ever. \n Turning now specifically to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Lloyd will walk you through the guidance in a few minutes, but I will note that the growth pattern will be different from recent years. This is due to a number of factors from productivity and PTO trends to the Liberty acquisition and the timing of headcount gains. We expect these factors together to produce a revenue profile with low single-digit growth in the first half, followed by a significant acceleration in the second half. \n We plan to the full year, and as our guidance indicates, we expect another year of significant revenue growth in FY '22. Continued excellence in operational performance is also expected to produce strong EBITDA growth, continued cash generation and strategic capital deployment. \n So to sum up, I am excited and optimistic about the coming year and beyond. Our clients have clear priorities and the ability to marshal resources towards them. We have an exceptional team, an exceptional team tested and successful through good times and challenging ones. Our balance sheet is strong. Our unwavering commitment to people over the past year has bolstered our already strong brand in the market for talent. And all of us are committed to and focused on serving clients with excellence and living our purpose and our values. \n So while we may still see some choppiness and we have work to do on hiring in the coming months, I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to deliver growth in the near and the long term. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lloyd for the full financial results and the outlook for fiscal year 2022. \nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Horacio's comments on the closeout of our investment thesis. Last quarter marked the end of a 3-year period with ADEPS growth of 96%, an increase that was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion. This performance resulted from investments related to Vision 2020 and our early positioning in core areas of rising demand for our clients. Booz Allen has proven its ability to outperform competitors even in some of the toughest macro environments. Moving forward, we will keep a sharp focus on positioning Booz Allen for long-term success, building on the excellent performance of the last 3 years. \n As we look back over the past year, we are proud of the resilience and dedication shown by our people in close collaboration with our clients. Their excellent work resulted in another strong year of operational and financial performance. As we begin fiscal year 2022 and anticipate moving toward a post-pandemic operating rhythm, we expect some choppiness, but we have clear operational focus areas. Our confidence in our continued success is grounded in our record of consistent performance and the strong foundation we have built to deliver on near- and long-term objectives. \n Let's turn to our fiscal year 2021 results. Please turn to Slide 6. At the top line, revenue increased 5.3% for the full year to $7.9 billion. Revenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 7.1% to $5.5 billion. This organic top line growth largely reflects strong execution on sustained demand for our services, helped by higher-than-normal staff utilization in the first half of the year. \n As a reminder, in January, we adjusted our revenue guidance to a range of 4.8% to 6% due to 3 factors: first, programmatic shift in the presidential transition period; second, a snapback to more typical PTO usage; and third, lower expectations for billable expenses as a percentage of revenue, which landed in the low end of our 29% to 31% range. These factors played out in the fourth quarter as expected. \n Let me step through the market performance. Revenue growth for the full year was led by our defense and civil businesses, which grew 9% and 8%, respectively. In defense, growth slowed in the second half of the year due to the factors I noted earlier. However, underlying long-term demand for our services and solutions remain strong as evidenced by recent business wins and continued tactical sales execution. \n Growth in our civil business also slowed in the second half of the year. This was largely related to a pause on a large cyber program due to funding availability, which occurred in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. Given the importance and criticality of this program for the client, we believe work will ramp up again in the coming quarters. \n Revenue from our intelligence business declined 3% for the full year. Our focused effort to reshape that portfolio continues, and we are pleased with the results so far. We expect to see our intelligence business return to growth in this fiscal year as we ramp up recent contract wins. Furthermore, the pandemic-related headwind we faced in fiscal year 2021 and inability to bill for fee will continue to abate as more and more of our employees return to work at client facilities. \n Lastly, revenue in global commercial, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021, declined 22% year-over-year. The drop was primarily driven by our decision to exit from parts of our Middle East business due to market dynamics and geopolitical trends and to focus strategically on our U.S.-based cyber business. \n Please turn to Slide 7. We are pleased with our excellent book-to-bill performance for the quarter and the full year. Book-to-bill of 1.38x was a fourth quarter record, resulting in a full year book-to-bill of 1.42x. Total backlog grew 16%, yielding our largest ever fiscal year-end backlog of $24 billion. Funded backlog grew 3% to $3.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 35% to $6.1 billion. And price options grew 13% to $14.4 billion. \n Throughout the year, the team did a great job sustaining our historical win rates for recompetes and new work even as we navigated the pandemic and a presidential transition period. As we've noted previously, we continue to augment our traditional foundation of diversified, smaller awards by pursuing larger and more complex bids that, by their very nature, cause quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill. Our record backlog speaks to ongoing robust demand for our services, the quality of our people and our closeness to clients' missions. \n Pivoting to headcount. As of March 31, we had 27,727 employees, up by 554 year-over-year or 2%. Excluding the impact of our contract divestiture in the third quarter, headcount would have been up 2.4%. As Horacio emphasized, we are focused on accelerating headcount growth to meet strong demand signals and execute our backlog. \n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 was $840 million, up 11.4% from the previous year. This increase was driven primarily by our top line growth, strong cost management and lower-than-expected billable expense mix in what was truly an anomalous year. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 10.7%. \n Full year net income, diluted EPS and ADEPS also grew significantly. Net income increased 26% year-over-year to $609 million. Adjusted net income was $542 million, up 21% from the previous year. Diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $4.37 from $3.41 the year prior. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $3.90 from $3.18 the year prior. These increases were primarily driven by strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count in fiscal year 2021 due to our share repurchase program. \n Regarding our effective tax rate, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a tax benefit under the CARES Act that allowed tax loss carrybacks to prior tax years. As a result, we recognized approximately $77 million in remeasurement tax benefit this quarter, which we excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. \n Turning to cash. We put a plan in place 3 years ago to improve cash generation. We are extremely proud of our team's performance this year, which we see as the culmination of this multiyear effort. We generated $719 million in operating cash during fiscal year 2021, representing 30% growth over the previous year. That put us above the top end of our forecasted range, and we ended the year with $991 million of cash on hand. \n Strong cash performance was largely driven by collections growth in excess of revenue growth. Higher cash taxes on the year were offset by relatively light disbursements related to operating in the COVID-19 environment. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $87 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to support virtual work. \n April was a key month for us as we went live with our new next-gen financial system. Our year-end reporting close went smoothly, and we have not encountered any material issues to date. As can be expected, we experienced a few minor issues, which were addressed promptly. We have already been reaping the benefits in the form of increased data access and improved productivity. We expect this to translate into cost savings over time, which will be reinvested to help drive future growth. \n I want to thank all of my colleagues who worked tirelessly to make this a seamless and successful transition. I will touch on this topic again in our outlook for fiscal year 2022. \n Please turn to Slide 8. In fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute on a prudent capital allocation strategy designed to deliver both near- and long-term shareholder value. We returned approximately $181 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends, which included a 19% year-over-year dividend increase in the fourth quarter. This was the eighth consecutive fiscal year of double-digit growth in our quarterly dividend. \n We also repurchased 4.1 million shares for $318 million during the fiscal year with 2.3 million shares repurchased for $185 million in the fourth quarter. In combination with our third quarter investment in Tracepoint, we deployed a total of $571 million in capital in fiscal year 2021. \n Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: reinvesting in our business; securing our quarterly dividend; strategic acquisitions; and share repurchases. Today, we are also announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15. Dividends remain an important component of our strategy to create value for shareholders. \n Lastly, I want to briefly touch on our recently announced acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions. This transaction, upon close, will be our largest acquisition to date and will be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For us, this transaction represents exactly what we look for in acquisitions: cultural, strategic and financial fit. \n As we look ahead, we are focused on 3 objectives: first, a smooth and successful integration; second, continued hiring to help scale up Liberty's recent wins; and third, maintaining excellence in contract delivery. As Horacio noted, we are excited about the acquisition and the long-term value it will create for our shareholders and the people of both Booz Allen and Liberty. We look forward to sharing updates in the months to come. \n Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of unprecedented challenges for our people and clients. This resulted in several puts and takes to our fiscal year 2021 financial results, which influence year-over-year comparisons as we move into fiscal year 2022. Most of these factors are temporary in nature. However, we expect them to constrain top line growth for the next couple of quarters before an acceleration into the back half of the fiscal year. \n Let me step through these factors. First, there is a natural ramp-up that needs to occur in both execution of work on recently won contracts and on recruiting and hiring. As Horacio noted, we are focused on both of those priorities. They take time to ramp up, which creates a momentum built towards the back half of the year. \n Second, we saw unusually high productivity in the first half of fiscal year 2021, driving up revenue growth then slowing growth in the second half as staff utilization and PTO trends normalize. This dynamic will create challenging comps in the first half of fiscal year 2022. \n Third, we expect PTO trends to have an ongoing impact for the next few months. Although we executed a successful onetime PTO buyback program in the fourth quarter, we know that many of our employees still have elevated balances due to the pandemic. With vaccinations increasing and some are on the way, we expect and have been encouraging our people to take well-deserved time off. \n Lastly, our implementation of the new financial system will result in minor timing differences in the costing of labor. We do not expect this dynamic to materially impact our full year results. However, we do forecast approximately 50 basis points of revenue growth headwinds in each of our second and third quarters, recovered through a roughly 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter. \n Putting it all together, we expect organic top line growth in the low single-digit range in the first half of fiscal year 2022 with a significant ramp into the third and fourth quarters. From an EBITDA perspective, a return to more normal indirect spending patterns and billable expense mix post-pandemic will drive some volatility in our quarterly margin profile. \n Now let me take you through our fiscal year 2022 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow between 7% and 10%, which is inclusive of a partial year contribution from our announced Liberty acquisition, assuming a first quarter 2022 close. The variance between the top and bottom end of our revenue growth outlook will largely depend on the successful execution and timing of our hiring and onboarding. \n We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-10% range. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30. This range reflects strong organic growth, incremental D&A expense related to our new financial system, a higher effective tax rate and $0.20 to $0.24 of anticipated accretion from our acquisition of Liberty IT. This guidance is based on 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 22% to 24%. \n We expect operating cash flow to be between $800 million and $850 million, largely driven by our operational performance, lower cash tax payments and contributions from Liberty IT. And finally, we expect CapEx to be between $80 million and $100 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. \n In closing, we are extremely proud of our fiscal year 2021 performance. I want to thank our clients and the entire Booz Allen family for managing through a complex year. We have once again demonstrated our ability to effectively manage the business, invest in our people and deliver strong returns to our shareholders. We did all of this while weathering a tough macro environment, which gives us confidence in our strategy and positioning to succeed through any market condition. \n With that, Rubun, let's open the lines for questions. \nRubun Dey: Thanks, Lloyd. Operator, please open the lines. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. \nRobert Spingarn: Horacio, a question on a couple of areas of opportunity. The new administration has talked about raising the IRS budget pretty significantly. And that's a big customer for you, I think, a long-term customer. Could that present an opportunity for more work? And then I wanted to ask a similar question on cyber. \nHoracio Rozanski: Rob, I think we are very excited about the opportunities we see in front of us across the board. On your specific question, we are definitely working with the IRS. They've been a client for 30, 40 years. And we do a lot of great work with them around their digital transformation, around fraud detection, around cyber and a number of other things. So we see upside there, for sure. But we really see upside across the entirety of the portfolio. \n On the demand side, you saw the book-to-bill numbers. They are stellar for the quarter and more importantly, the type of work that we're winning. If you look at our defense business, the digital transformation of the Department of Defense is accelerating. And I believe they view Booz Allen as a real partner in making that happen. In the intelligence community, we're doing some amazing work around cyber, around AI, around 5G in -- across the civil space, beyond the areas. We've talked about health. We've talked about Liberty. I'm very excited about what's going on and the possibilities for growth in the near and the medium term. \nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just a quick one for Lloyd. How should we think about wage inflation risk at this point? And if it happens on a multiyear fixed price contract, are you limited in how quickly you can pass that through? \nLloyd Howell: We don't think so. Historically, let's say, past 5 years, certainly, as these higher solution, IT solution capabilities have been in demand, clients have been willing to accept higher compensated folks in the labor categories as well as with the escalations tied to that. \n So from a fixed price standpoint, we manage our contracts well. We have the right risk mitigation oversight in place and have not experienced any unfortunate results in executing those types of contracts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. \nSeth Seifman: As a first question, I wonder if you could talk about the ramp-up in hiring that's coming in the first half. Should we think about that as being sort of commensurate with the kind of revenue growth that we're looking for? And then just the environment in terms of acquiring new talent in this kind of labor market that we're in now, whether things have become any tougher or easier. \nHoracio Rozanski: Why don't I start and Lloyd might want to add as well. I'll take you back to last fall. And in the middle of the pandemic, we have a number of operating priorities, and we were operating at very high productivity levels. So while hiring is always a priority at Booz Allen, it probably wasn't top 3. \n We shifted that stance. It really -- in the mid-winter months, and we are now very focused on that. So I fully expect our hiring to ramp up strongly. And we'll get to the numbers we want to get to probably by the second half of the year. We -- there's some choppiness as we accelerate into it. But it's a question of timing, not a question of -- there's no structural issue. \n As I look further out into the fall and beyond, I've been talking to a lot of people and -- both in our industry and across industries about what they view of the market as post-pandemic. And I think everybody is thinking about how the labor market is going to change. But frankly, I think Booz Allen is somewhere out in front on those conversations. We have a very strong talent brand that was, if anything, burnished over the last year with everything that we did that we described in the prepared remarks to support our people, to have challenging conversations, to get us to the place where we are today. \n We're having really good discussions with some of our clients about the opportunity for more flexibility and to distribute our labor force differently in support of them, and there's more receptivity to those discussions than there was pre-pandemic. And we are imagining new ways of working that leverage our footprint differently that give people more flexibility that, I think, all of which is going to put us in an even better stead, not just for this year but beyond as we look to attract the right kind of talent to our firm. \nLloyd Howell: The only point I would add is that ramping up our headcount is going to take some time. And it sort of speaks to Horacio's comment about choppiness. And we've built that into our guidance range. So if you look at the 4% to 7% organic portion of the 7% to 10%, where we will end up within that is really a timing of the headcount gain. But we're confident, our leaders are on it and we expect to do well. \nSeth Seifman: Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, Lloyd, with a quick numbers question. If I just look at what seems to be embedded in the P&L guidance, you take the EBITDA and you take out the interest expense and the taxes, it looks like maybe you convert about 70% to 75% of your EBITDA to operating cash flow. But it looks like you really convert more like 90%. Is the difference there just cash versus booked taxes? Or is there a significant working capital reduction that you're looking for? Or something else involving timing? \nLloyd Howell: No, we don't see any differences from how we've operated the business in the past. It's really probably just a function of timing. But we expect strong conversion as we always have. And as you have seen historically, our cash generation has been really well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss with Barclays. \nDavid Strauss: I guess just to put a finer point on the hiring question. What do you have embedded in the 4% to 7% organic revenue growth, Lloyd? What do you have embedded for headcount gains this year? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. We -- every year, we go into it targeting mid-single digits. But as Horacio and I said last quarter, it's going to take some time to crank up to that point. So our commentary about first half buildup into sort of hitting our stride in the second half is reflective of this buildup. But we expect, as we go into every year, to improve on what we -- how we exited '21, and we're targeting mid-single digits. \nDavid Strauss: Okay. And from an absolute EBITDA margin standpoint, it looks like ex Liberty, the guidance for this year embeds about 4% to 5% adjusted EBITDA growth. Do you still see this as a longer-term, mid- to high single-digit absolute EBITDA growth kind of company? \nLloyd Howell: We do. We do. We've been consistently adding to our portfolio capabilities that are certainly in higher demand. Clients are rewarding us for that. And we see the profitability also improving, the execution of the work being stronger and stronger year-over-year. So we definitely see us remaining in that range going forward. \nHoracio Rozanski: David, just to build or foot stomp what Lloyd is saying, we're guiding to a year of strong growth in FY '22 at the top line, and we are confident of our ability to continue to drive high margins and drive EBITDA dollar growth as a result. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: So could you give us some more details on Liberty? You're assuming $0.24 of accretion, but what are you assuming for the single point revenue number? When exactly do you expect to close it? What's the amortization? Give us some details on that, please? \nLloyd Howell: Sure. Cai, as you may recall, we paid $725 million. The numbers I'm about to run through are assuming an all-cash financing. We expect to close in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We expect a partial year contribution of $300 million to $340 million annualized from Liberty. The adjusted EBITDA contribution will be somewhere between $46 million and $50 million. And the adjusted diluted EPS which you said is somewhere between $0.20 and $0.24. \nCai Von Rumohr: Okay. So maybe turning to book-to-bill, you had a very strong book-to-bill in what traditionally is not such a hot quarter, almost 2x what you'd normally do. Could you give us some color on what the bookings outlook is like now that we're starting to fill some of the slots in the federal government? How does Q2 look? How does the June quarter and September quarter look? Normally, September is the peak, but give us some color there, if you could. \nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, I'll start. It's Horacio. The -- as you know, we've been saying for quite a while that we're not demand constrained. And in fact, we see a very good market in front of us. Something shifted to the right from our third quarter of last year to our fourth quarter of last year, and we shared some of those views with all of you on the last earnings call. And I think the book-to-bill numbers that we're putting up are in part that dynamic and in part the fact that the team has really done a spectacular job at capturing competitive work right at the center of our strategy, the things we've all been wanting to do. \n That gives me optimism and confidence that we are on strategy and on trend to continue to capture opportunity as the Biden administration ramps up. The pipeline is strong. The types of work that we're going after is exciting. You might have seen the announcements on Rainmaker, for example, in the Army. I mean there's a lot of really good work that Booz Allen is bringing into our portfolio that positions us in the center of this digital transformation as a partner and a catalyst of all of our clients. So we see a lot of room to run and a lot of room to grow on the demand side. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Konrad with Jefferies. \nGreg Konrad: Just to touch on commercial, I mean, I know it's relatively small, but you talked about kind of the shift away from the Middle East and focus on the U.S. But just in light of the Colonial Pipeline attack, what type of activity are you seeing in that business either from inquiries or just the overall pipeline? \nHoracio Rozanski: We're excited about what we're seeing. Both in our own business and in this investment we've made in Tracepoint. We are seeing demand driven by an environment that is increasingly more challenging for our commercial clients. And they view Booz Allen as a serious player with unique capabilities to help them, especially against some of these more sophisticated types of attacks. \n So we're well positioned in our U.S. commercial business, centered on cybersecurity. As we said, we made some transitions out of some of our work in the Middle East. And we see growth in the year ahead. \nGreg Konrad: And then just as a follow-up, just on guidance. I mean the billable expenses kind of returned to a normalized range. And should we think of those as kind of the same cadence as revenue where you kind of have a ramp in the second half? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean it's hard to truly forecast billable expenses. But we do expect it to start to move more to the middle of our range, which has historically been 29% to 31%. So we certainly see the momentum picking up throughout the year and expect that when we get to the second half of the year, it will be maybe pre-pandemic, slightly less than pre-pandemic levels. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. \nMatthew Akers: I was wondering if there's a way to think about kind of like a normalized or maybe like a second half kind of exit margin rate for the business? Just trying to get a feel for, once we get through some of this noise in the first half and you have Liberty IT, kind of a way to think of the ongoing profitability of the business? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean we did our best to reflect that in the guidance of 10.5%. We think that captures sort of the annual kind of puts and takes that we'll see as things start to return to normal. So we haven't -- I'm not going to try to give you a quarter-by-quarter sort of exits, but the 10.5%, I think, really captures our strong margins, and we're really happy about that. \nMatthew Akers: Got it. Okay. And then I guess just kind of a broader question on M&A. I mean it sounds like Liberty IT really kind of hit all the things you were looking for, but is, I guess, still a little bit kind of out of character to do a deal this size for Booz. So I guess does that imply anything in terms of what the future mix of capital deployment could be? Or is this really just kind of a one-off instance where it was just a great asset that really fit well? \nHoracio Rozanski: I guess the way I would characterize our posture towards M&A is we've said over the last year, we increasingly view our balance sheet as a strategic asset. We have a lot of strength there. We have the ability to deploy capital against strong opportunities and we're not in a rush. We have an approach. We're disciplined. And I believe it's an approach that will actually create value for our shareholders in the near and the long term. \n And importantly, from a strategy standpoint, I talked about the acceleration of digital transformation. I view M&A, when done right, as a strategic accelerator for us. The ability to leapfrog some of our own development and scaling of some of our own capabilities to get them there a couple of years faster, Liberty is a good example of that. We have -- we're always in the market looking for things that will let us do that. And to the extent that we find them, to the extent that they make sense strategically, financially and culturally, we will do more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons of Goldman Sachs. \nGavin Parsons: Horacio, when I think about your revenue growth and unique capabilities, over the last few years, our peers have scaled up, refocused their R&D, they've acquired more unique technologies and so on and so forth. So from a qualitative standpoint, do you feel like you've been able to maintain your capability gap relative to peers? And then from a quantitative standpoint, do you think you can continue to outgrow revenue by a similar magnitude as you have in the past? \nHoracio Rozanski: The short form of the answer, Gavin, is yes to both. So I can stop there. I can give you a little more. Honestly, I am very proud of what the team has done. And even during a pandemic year, we continue to invest. We're always out in front. It's an exciting time to be at Booz Allen. \n We're having discussions with clients unlike discussions we ever had before about not just some of these technologies, but how they really can transform mission. And we're doing this not just at the working level, but at the very senior level in these agencies. And because we're having these discussions, because we are confident that we understand what our clients need to do, we continue to invest in the next generation of technologies, not just the current generation. \n So while we're scaling cloud, we're working on low-code. While we're working on cyber, we're thinking about 5G and quantum and the impact on cyber. We're already, as you know, a leader on AI. And we continue to, if anything, extend that gap. \n So there's no birthright here. You have to show up every day and make it happen for your clients, for your people, on the contracts for our investors. And we're very focused on that. But I am very optimistic. \nGavin Parsons: Yes. It was a very clear answer, but I definitely appreciate the detail. When I think about just the impact of COVID this year on revenue and margins, obviously, last year, you had the tailwind in the first half of the year, but then the billables headwind in the second half and maybe some margin puts and takes as well. \n Should we think of this year as still having a margin headwind from elevated medical or so expenses? And then is there -- what is the net revenue impact of COVID this year? Is it a tailwind or a headwind? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. We haven't itemized it in terms of the dollar amount. But this is what I would offer to you. Certainly, in the first half of the year, we expect unallowables to remain low. We expect a return to average. CARES Act is sunsetting, so we expect to be able to invoice for fee going forward. So there will be, over the course of the year, this sort of shift from the midst of COVID to sort of pre-COVID dynamics. \n And then what I would say on the revenue side, I think you've heard it in Horacio's commentary, we're not demand constrained. I mean this is all about us bringing on the talent to convert the strong backlog performance and just solid client execution. So that's our top operational priority, and we'll work through the choppiness that we spoke about this morning, but we remain very optimistic. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. \nTobey Sommer: Can you help us reconcile the high priority that cyber holds for your customers with the contract you have that's kind of put on hold because of funding? Because it seems like in most circumstances, cyber might win out funding and something else may lose. \nHoracio Rozanski: Tobey, I think this is -- there was an unexpected slowdown in funding towards the end of last year. And it's -- with the transition of administration, people still coming in, priorities being realigned, we believe, like you, that the direction of travel is towards fully funding those areas and prioritizing them. \n But it's a process. And it's a process that has its own timing, and we are very close to our clients on this. We're working with them every day. We want to make sure they get not just the amount, but the quality of the work that they need, and we will continue to do that. \nTobey Sommer: Within the civil space, the President's budget request is pretty exciting. Where do you see the biggest opportunities for growth within your civil book? And is the company adequately sized? Or could we assume that in your answer, you would direct a disproportionate amount of your headcount growth in that direction? \nHoracio Rozanski: I think we're always looking for opportunities to grow. And as you know, one of the things about our operating model that allows us to do that is the single P&L and the ability to shift resources. So we're making these decisions dynamically and almost daily. There's clearly opportunities in our health business and where health care access is a significant priority. \n We talked before about the IRS, about our entire citizen services portfolio is being transformed by digital technologies, and we're in the midst of that. Our work at DHS is -- has opportunity and upside, especially around cybersecurity. \n So I believe we're well positioned. And civil is obviously an area of interest and an area of strength for us. But I believe I could tell you a similar story about intelligence and about defense about our positioning for the coming months. We have work to do, we're on it and our teams are doing really well. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. \nRonald Epstein: Defense and intel represents about 70% of the current revenues, correct? And that's down from almost 80% if you go back to kind of 2013, 2014 time frame. If we think about the... \nHoracio Rozanski: You broke up at the beginning of the question, we're having a hard time hearing you. Do you mind starting from the top again? Sorry. \nRonald Epstein: Yes. Sure. Is that better? Can you hear me better? \nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. \nLloyd Howell: Yes. \nRonald Epstein: Sure. So defense and intel represents about 70% of the current revenues. And that's down from maybe 80% if you go back, say, 6, 7 years ago. What do you see that -- where do you see the split between defense versus civil 5 to 10 years from now, particularly in light of some of the M&A you've done already with Liberty and some of the emerging technologies? \nHoracio Rozanski: We don't honestly think about the business that way. We are going -- we have a robust presence across the entirety of the federal government. We pick and choose and curate the agencies and the places that we serve, to the places where we believe what we do will add the most value to clients. And then we dynamically manage the business as the priorities emerge and change over time. So I don't know that I could tell you exactly where our business is going to be 5 or 10 years from now on a market breakdown. \n What I can tell you is that our ambition, our expectation is that as the digital transformation accelerates, Booz Allen will accelerate with it. We'll stay out in front and across all of the clients that are really in the thick of it, be it defense, intelligence and civil, Booz Allen will be a meaningful scale presence and an innovator. \nRonald Epstein: And then maybe one follow on if I may. Can you discuss the competitive dynamics right now with the defense budget flattening, right? I mean it seems like the defense budget might not necessarily go down, but it seems like we're kind of maybe in an inflationary growth environment for a while. \nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. No. I think you heard us say that, that was, in some ways, our anticipation for the next few years. And I think what we tried to do -- I know what we've tried to do is to really be positioned as a digital innovator, as a digital integrator around all of these technologies that are going to be in high demand. Even in any agency, a flattening budget doesn't mean that everything grows at the same rate. Some things are going to get prioritized and continue to grow. I think we're well positioned against those. Some areas are probably not going to grow as much or may even decline in order to fund the priorities. \n And I think our job is to, a, stay very close to our clients and understand that as quickly as they do. And I believe we're doing a good job of that. And b, to make sure that our operating model and the flexibility in our operating model gives us an edge as we migrate from place to place in order to capture the growth areas. And so that's why when you sort of sum it all up, our strong organic growth is always above market, and we have an expectation to continue to grow well above market on the back of all of those things. \nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Horacio Rozanski for any further remarks. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you. Thank you all for your questions this morning. I hope this discussion put FY '21 results in context and it added to your perspective about FY '22 and beyond. \n Before I close, I would like to acknowledge that May is Military Appreciation Month. And at Booz Allen, our partnership with our military clients is a source of deep pride and a big part of our purpose. So on behalf of the entire leadership team of our firm, I want to thank all who currently serve and all who have served in the armed forces, and that includes thousands of our colleagues. Your service and your sacrifice are deeply appreciated by all of us and by a grateful nation. And with that, have a great day, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rubun, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I are proud to announce Booz Allen's results for fiscal year 2021 this morning, another stellar performance by the people of our firm. \n The past year was unlike any other in this company's 107-year history. That's simple fact. And all the complexity it sums up makes the results we are reporting this morning all the more impressive. But before diving into our latest results and our outlook for the current year, I want to highlight that the fiscal year-end on March 31 also marked the close of the 3-year period covered in our investment thesis. \n When we first shared our thesis in June of 2018, we committed to 50% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share over 3 years. We said that growth would be driven by our unique position in the market and the combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and robust capital deployment. With our fiscal year 2021 results now final, Booz Allen has significantly exceeded our 3-year financial objectives. \n ADEPS nearly doubled over the period to $3.90 in fiscal year 2021. Average annual revenue growth was above the midpoint of the 6% to 9% range we originally provided. Adjusted EBITDA margin was above 10% in each of the 3 years. And we deployed $1.3 billion in capital, the majority of which was achieved through increased dividends and a robust share repurchase program. \n During the 3-year period, we navigated through significant budget uncertainty, including the longest government shutdown we've ever experienced, a turbulent presidential transition period and a once-in-a-century pandemic. And throughout, we continued to invest in our people, especially when we set aside $100 million in response to the pandemic to support our employees and help the most vulnerable in our communities. All the while, we also continued to invest in our key technologies and develop elements of our option value portfolio. \n So the story over the last 3 years is certainly about outstanding financial performance. But more importantly, as we look to the future, it is the basis for our optimistic outlook on the business. Over the last decade, we further differentiated Booz Allen's brand and market position to the point that today, federal and commercial clients rely on us for advanced technology solutions that deliver both speed and mission scale. And our unique combination of consulting expertise, mission knowledge, innovation and technology serves as a strategic accelerator for both our firm and our clients. \n I've said many times, Booz Allen learns and evolves continuously. Our next strategy and long-term financial outlook, which we plan to share with you in the fall, will build on Vision 2020's growth and transformation. We are very comfortable with our direction of travel as we anticipate the opportunities of the next decade. \n The most recent example of our confidence in our strategic direction is our agreement to acquire Liberty IT Solutions, LLC. As we discussed when we announced it on May 4, this acquisition is directly on strategy. Liberty is an exceptional company with highly skilled talent, trusted client relationships, closeness to mission, a solid growth trajectory and digital transformation capabilities that augment Booz Allen's extensive set of offerings. The transaction is expected to close in this quarter, subject to customary closing conditions. And we look forward to officially welcoming the Liberty team to the Booz Allen Family. \n Let's turn now to the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year financial results released this morning. Lloyd and I are proud of the team's performance in an unprecedented year. On all metrics, we have met or exceeded the updated guidance we provided at the end of January. \n For the full year, organic revenue growth was strong, albeit slower than recent years due to the pandemic and some delays in funding and awards after the election. We also delivered excellent bottom line results. Full year earnings, profit margins and cash flow are all ahead of expectations. And as the market began to stabilize post transition, our team did a great job in capturing opportunities, driving a record book-to-bill in the fourth quarter and year-end backlog of $24 billion. \n Underlying demand for our services and solutions remain robust, with our defense and civil businesses delivering excellent organic growth in fiscal year 2021, while intelligence and global commercial continue to reshape their portfolios. Lloyd will go into greater depth about market dynamics in a few minutes. \n Next, I am pleased to report that the Department of Justice has closed the criminal investigation that we first disclosed in June 2017. The civil DOJ and SEC investigations remain pending. And we continue to cooperate with the government to bring those matters to an appropriate resolution. \n Let's shift now to how we are thinking about the business in the year ahead. As we open fiscal year 2022, we are very focused on a set of near and midterm priorities. First and foremost, to fully benefit from our strong backlog and demand pipeline, we need to accelerate our recruiting efforts. Second, we must capitalize on the reshaped portfolios in intelligence and commercial to drive growth in both businesses. Third, we will carefully manage the transition to a post-COVID environment by investing in our people and the advanced capabilities we need for the future. Fourth, having launched our next-generation financial system on April 1, we are making strong progress, and we'll keep focused on a seamless implementation. And fifth, upon close of the Liberty acquisition, we will work closely together on a smooth and successful integration. \n As we look further out, we're also focused on positioning for growth beyond the current fiscal year. Our overriding goal is to accelerate into the next wave of changes in our market, from monetizing the option value portfolio; to investing in new areas like low-code, 5G, AI or quantum; to finalizing our strategic review. Booz Allen is committed to being a leader in ensuring our clients can scale new technologies into their missions faster than ever. \n Turning now specifically to our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Lloyd will walk you through the guidance in a few minutes, but I will note that the growth pattern will be different from recent years. This is due to a number of factors from productivity and PTO trends to the Liberty acquisition and the timing of headcount gains. We expect these factors together to produce a revenue profile with low single-digit growth in the first half, followed by a significant acceleration in the second half. \n We plan to the full year, and as our guidance indicates, we expect another year of significant revenue growth in FY '22. Continued excellence in operational performance is also expected to produce strong EBITDA growth, continued cash generation and strategic capital deployment. \n So to sum up, I am excited and optimistic about the coming year and beyond. Our clients have clear priorities and the ability to marshal resources towards them. We have an exceptional team, an exceptional team tested and successful through good times and challenging ones. Our balance sheet is strong. Our unwavering commitment to people over the past year has bolstered our already strong brand in the market for talent. And all of us are committed to and focused on serving clients with excellence and living our purpose and our values. \n So while we may still see some choppiness and we have work to do on hiring in the coming months, I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to deliver growth in the near and the long term. \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Lloyd for the full financial results and the outlook for fiscal year 2022. Rob, I think we are very excited about the opportunities we see in front of us across the board. On your specific question, we are definitely working with the IRS. They've been a client for 30, 40 years. And we do a lot of great work with them around their digital transformation, around fraud detection, around cyber and a number of other things. So we see upside there, for sure. But we really see upside across the entirety of the portfolio. \n On the demand side, you saw the book-to-bill numbers. They are stellar for the quarter and more importantly, the type of work that we're winning. If you look at our defense business, the digital transformation of the Department of Defense is accelerating. And I believe they view Booz Allen as a real partner in making that happen. In the intelligence community, we're doing some amazing work around cyber, around AI, around 5G in -- across the civil space, beyond the areas. We've talked about health. We've talked about Liberty. I'm very excited about what's going on and the possibilities for growth in the near and the medium term. Why don't I start and Lloyd might want to add as well. I'll take you back to last fall. And in the middle of the pandemic, we have a number of operating priorities, and we were operating at very high productivity levels. So while hiring is always a priority at Booz Allen, it probably wasn't top 3. \n We shifted that stance. It really -- in the mid-winter months, and we are now very focused on that. So I fully expect our hiring to ramp up strongly. And we'll get to the numbers we want to get to probably by the second half of the year. We -- there's some choppiness as we accelerate into it. But it's a question of timing, not a question of -- there's no structural issue. \n As I look further out into the fall and beyond, I've been talking to a lot of people and -- both in our industry and across industries about what they view of the market as post-pandemic. And I think everybody is thinking about how the labor market is going to change. But frankly, I think Booz Allen is somewhere out in front on those conversations. We have a very strong talent brand that was, if anything, burnished over the last year with everything that we did that we described in the prepared remarks to support our people, to have challenging conversations, to get us to the place where we are today. \n We're having really good discussions with some of our clients about the opportunity for more flexibility and to distribute our labor force differently in support of them, and there's more receptivity to those discussions than there was pre-pandemic. And we are imagining new ways of working that leverage our footprint differently that give people more flexibility that, I think, all of which is going to put us in an even better stead, not just for this year but beyond as we look to attract the right kind of talent to our firm. David, just to build or foot stomp what Lloyd is saying, we're guiding to a year of strong growth in FY '22 at the top line, and we are confident of our ability to continue to drive high margins and drive EBITDA dollar growth as a result. Cai, I'll start. It's Horacio. The -- as you know, we've been saying for quite a while that we're not demand constrained. And in fact, we see a very good market in front of us. Something shifted to the right from our third quarter of last year to our fourth quarter of last year, and we shared some of those views with all of you on the last earnings call. And I think the book-to-bill numbers that we're putting up are in part that dynamic and in part the fact that the team has really done a spectacular job at capturing competitive work right at the center of our strategy, the things we've all been wanting to do. \n That gives me optimism and confidence that we are on strategy and on trend to continue to capture opportunity as the Biden administration ramps up. The pipeline is strong. The types of work that we're going after is exciting. You might have seen the announcements on Rainmaker, for example, in the Army. I mean there's a lot of really good work that Booz Allen is bringing into our portfolio that positions us in the center of this digital transformation as a partner and a catalyst of all of our clients. So we see a lot of room to run and a lot of room to grow on the demand side. We're excited about what we're seeing. Both in our own business and in this investment we've made in Tracepoint. We are seeing demand driven by an environment that is increasingly more challenging for our commercial clients. And they view Booz Allen as a serious player with unique capabilities to help them, especially against some of these more sophisticated types of attacks. \n So we're well positioned in our U.S. commercial business, centered on cybersecurity. As we said, we made some transitions out of some of our work in the Middle East. And we see growth in the year ahead. I guess the way I would characterize our posture towards M&A is we've said over the last year, we increasingly view our balance sheet as a strategic asset. We have a lot of strength there. We have the ability to deploy capital against strong opportunities and we're not in a rush. We have an approach. We're disciplined. And I believe it's an approach that will actually create value for our shareholders in the near and the long term. \n And importantly, from a strategy standpoint, I talked about the acceleration of digital transformation. I view M&A, when done right, as a strategic accelerator for us. The ability to leapfrog some of our own development and scaling of some of our own capabilities to get them there a couple of years faster, Liberty is a good example of that. We have -- we're always in the market looking for things that will let us do that. And to the extent that we find them, to the extent that they make sense strategically, financially and culturally, we will do more. The short form of the answer, Gavin, is yes to both. So I can stop there. I can give you a little more. Honestly, I am very proud of what the team has done. And even during a pandemic year, we continue to invest. We're always out in front. It's an exciting time to be at Booz Allen. \n We're having discussions with clients unlike discussions we ever had before about not just some of these technologies, but how they really can transform mission. And we're doing this not just at the working level, but at the very senior level in these agencies. And because we're having these discussions, because we are confident that we understand what our clients need to do, we continue to invest in the next generation of technologies, not just the current generation. \n So while we're scaling cloud, we're working on low-code. While we're working on cyber, we're thinking about 5G and quantum and the impact on cyber. We're already, as you know, a leader on AI. And we continue to, if anything, extend that gap. \n So there's no birthright here. You have to show up every day and make it happen for your clients, for your people, on the contracts for our investors. And we're very focused on that. But I am very optimistic. Tobey, I think this is -- there was an unexpected slowdown in funding towards the end of last year. And it's -- with the transition of administration, people still coming in, priorities being realigned, we believe, like you, that the direction of travel is towards fully funding those areas and prioritizing them. \n But it's a process. And it's a process that has its own timing, and we are very close to our clients on this. We're working with them every day. We want to make sure they get not just the amount, but the quality of the work that they need, and we will continue to do that. I think we're always looking for opportunities to grow. And as you know, one of the things about our operating model that allows us to do that is the single P&L and the ability to shift resources. So we're making these decisions dynamically and almost daily. There's clearly opportunities in our health business and where health care access is a significant priority. \n We talked before about the IRS, about our entire citizen services portfolio is being transformed by digital technologies, and we're in the midst of that. Our work at DHS is -- has opportunity and upside, especially around cybersecurity. \n So I believe we're well positioned. And civil is obviously an area of interest and an area of strength for us. But I believe I could tell you a similar story about intelligence and about defense about our positioning for the coming months. We have work to do, we're on it and our teams are doing really well. You broke up at the beginning of the question, we're having a hard time hearing you. Do you mind starting from the top again? Sorry. Yes. We don't honestly think about the business that way. We are going -- we have a robust presence across the entirety of the federal government. We pick and choose and curate the agencies and the places that we serve, to the places where we believe what we do will add the most value to clients. And then we dynamically manage the business as the priorities emerge and change over time. So I don't know that I could tell you exactly where our business is going to be 5 or 10 years from now on a market breakdown. \n What I can tell you is that our ambition, our expectation is that as the digital transformation accelerates, Booz Allen will accelerate with it. We'll stay out in front and across all of the clients that are really in the thick of it, be it defense, intelligence and civil, Booz Allen will be a meaningful scale presence and an innovator. Yes. No. I think you heard us say that, that was, in some ways, our anticipation for the next few years. And I think what we tried to do -- I know what we've tried to do is to really be positioned as a digital innovator, as a digital integrator around all of these technologies that are going to be in high demand. Even in any agency, a flattening budget doesn't mean that everything grows at the same rate. Some things are going to get prioritized and continue to grow. I think we're well positioned against those. Some areas are probably not going to grow as much or may even decline in order to fund the priorities. \n And I think our job is to, a, stay very close to our clients and understand that as quickly as they do. And I believe we're doing a good job of that. And b, to make sure that our operating model and the flexibility in our operating model gives us an edge as we migrate from place to place in order to capture the growth areas. And so that's why when you sort of sum it all up, our strong organic growth is always above market, and we have an expectation to continue to grow well above market on the back of all of those things. Thank you. Thank you all for your questions this morning. I hope this discussion put FY '21 results in context and it added to your perspective about FY '22 and beyond. \n Before I close, I would like to acknowledge that May is Military Appreciation Month. And at Booz Allen, our partnership with our military clients is a source of deep pride and a big part of our purpose. So on behalf of the entire leadership team of our firm, I want to thank all who currently serve and all who have served in the armed forces, and that includes thousands of our colleagues. Your service and your sacrifice are deeply appreciated by all of us and by a grateful nation. And with that, have a great day, everyone."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Horacio's comments on the closeout of our investment thesis. Last quarter marked the end of a 3-year period with ADEPS growth of 96%, an increase that was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and sustained margin expansion. This performance resulted from investments related to Vision 2020 and our early positioning in core areas of rising demand for our clients. Booz Allen has proven its ability to outperform competitors even in some of the toughest macro environments. Moving forward, we will keep a sharp focus on positioning Booz Allen for long-term success, building on the excellent performance of the last 3 years. \n As we look back over the past year, we are proud of the resilience and dedication shown by our people in close collaboration with our clients. Their excellent work resulted in another strong year of operational and financial performance. As we begin fiscal year 2022 and anticipate moving toward a post-pandemic operating rhythm, we expect some choppiness, but we have clear operational focus areas. Our confidence in our continued success is grounded in our record of consistent performance and the strong foundation we have built to deliver on near- and long-term objectives. \n Let's turn to our fiscal year 2021 results. Please turn to Slide 6. At the top line, revenue increased 5.3% for the full year to $7.9 billion. Revenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 7.1% to $5.5 billion. This organic top line growth largely reflects strong execution on sustained demand for our services, helped by higher-than-normal staff utilization in the first half of the year. \n As a reminder, in January, we adjusted our revenue guidance to a range of 4.8% to 6% due to 3 factors: first, programmatic shift in the presidential transition period; second, a snapback to more typical PTO usage; and third, lower expectations for billable expenses as a percentage of revenue, which landed in the low end of our 29% to 31% range. These factors played out in the fourth quarter as expected. \n Let me step through the market performance. Revenue growth for the full year was led by our defense and civil businesses, which grew 9% and 8%, respectively. In defense, growth slowed in the second half of the year due to the factors I noted earlier. However, underlying long-term demand for our services and solutions remain strong as evidenced by recent business wins and continued tactical sales execution. \n Growth in our civil business also slowed in the second half of the year. This was largely related to a pause on a large cyber program due to funding availability, which occurred in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter. Given the importance and criticality of this program for the client, we believe work will ramp up again in the coming quarters. \n Revenue from our intelligence business declined 3% for the full year. Our focused effort to reshape that portfolio continues, and we are pleased with the results so far. We expect to see our intelligence business return to growth in this fiscal year as we ramp up recent contract wins. Furthermore, the pandemic-related headwind we faced in fiscal year 2021 and inability to bill for fee will continue to abate as more and more of our employees return to work at client facilities. \n Lastly, revenue in global commercial, which accounted for approximately 3% of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021, declined 22% year-over-year. The drop was primarily driven by our decision to exit from parts of our Middle East business due to market dynamics and geopolitical trends and to focus strategically on our U.S.-based cyber business. \n Please turn to Slide 7. We are pleased with our excellent book-to-bill performance for the quarter and the full year. Book-to-bill of 1.38x was a fourth quarter record, resulting in a full year book-to-bill of 1.42x. Total backlog grew 16%, yielding our largest ever fiscal year-end backlog of $24 billion. Funded backlog grew 3% to $3.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 35% to $6.1 billion. And price options grew 13% to $14.4 billion. \n Throughout the year, the team did a great job sustaining our historical win rates for recompetes and new work even as we navigated the pandemic and a presidential transition period. As we've noted previously, we continue to augment our traditional foundation of diversified, smaller awards by pursuing larger and more complex bids that, by their very nature, cause quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill. Our record backlog speaks to ongoing robust demand for our services, the quality of our people and our closeness to clients' missions. \n Pivoting to headcount. As of March 31, we had 27,727 employees, up by 554 year-over-year or 2%. Excluding the impact of our contract divestiture in the third quarter, headcount would have been up 2.4%. As Horacio emphasized, we are focused on accelerating headcount growth to meet strong demand signals and execute our backlog. \n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2021 was $840 million, up 11.4% from the previous year. This increase was driven primarily by our top line growth, strong cost management and lower-than-expected billable expense mix in what was truly an anomalous year. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 10.7%. \n Full year net income, diluted EPS and ADEPS also grew significantly. Net income increased 26% year-over-year to $609 million. Adjusted net income was $542 million, up 21% from the previous year. Diluted earnings per share increased 28% to $4.37 from $3.41 the year prior. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $3.90 from $3.18 the year prior. These increases were primarily driven by strong operating performance, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count in fiscal year 2021 due to our share repurchase program. \n Regarding our effective tax rate, during the fourth quarter, we recognized a tax benefit under the CARES Act that allowed tax loss carrybacks to prior tax years. As a result, we recognized approximately $77 million in remeasurement tax benefit this quarter, which we excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. \n Turning to cash. We put a plan in place 3 years ago to improve cash generation. We are extremely proud of our team's performance this year, which we see as the culmination of this multiyear effort. We generated $719 million in operating cash during fiscal year 2021, representing 30% growth over the previous year. That put us above the top end of our forecasted range, and we ended the year with $991 million of cash on hand. \n Strong cash performance was largely driven by collections growth in excess of revenue growth. Higher cash taxes on the year were offset by relatively light disbursements related to operating in the COVID-19 environment. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $87 million, in line with our expectations as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to support virtual work. \n April was a key month for us as we went live with our new next-gen financial system. Our year-end reporting close went smoothly, and we have not encountered any material issues to date. As can be expected, we experienced a few minor issues, which were addressed promptly. We have already been reaping the benefits in the form of increased data access and improved productivity. We expect this to translate into cost savings over time, which will be reinvested to help drive future growth. \n I want to thank all of my colleagues who worked tirelessly to make this a seamless and successful transition. I will touch on this topic again in our outlook for fiscal year 2022. \n Please turn to Slide 8. In fiscal year 2021, we continued to execute on a prudent capital allocation strategy designed to deliver both near- and long-term shareholder value. We returned approximately $181 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends, which included a 19% year-over-year dividend increase in the fourth quarter. This was the eighth consecutive fiscal year of double-digit growth in our quarterly dividend. \n We also repurchased 4.1 million shares for $318 million during the fiscal year with 2.3 million shares repurchased for $185 million in the fourth quarter. In combination with our third quarter investment in Tracepoint, we deployed a total of $571 million in capital in fiscal year 2021. \n Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: reinvesting in our business; securing our quarterly dividend; strategic acquisitions; and share repurchases. Today, we are also announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15. Dividends remain an important component of our strategy to create value for shareholders. \n Lastly, I want to briefly touch on our recently announced acquisition of Liberty IT Solutions. This transaction, upon close, will be our largest acquisition to date and will be immediately accretive to revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. For us, this transaction represents exactly what we look for in acquisitions: cultural, strategic and financial fit. \n As we look ahead, we are focused on 3 objectives: first, a smooth and successful integration; second, continued hiring to help scale up Liberty's recent wins; and third, maintaining excellence in contract delivery. As Horacio noted, we are excited about the acquisition and the long-term value it will create for our shareholders and the people of both Booz Allen and Liberty. We look forward to sharing updates in the months to come. \n Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. Fiscal year 2021 was certainly a year of unprecedented challenges for our people and clients. This resulted in several puts and takes to our fiscal year 2021 financial results, which influence year-over-year comparisons as we move into fiscal year 2022. Most of these factors are temporary in nature. However, we expect them to constrain top line growth for the next couple of quarters before an acceleration into the back half of the fiscal year. \n Let me step through these factors. First, there is a natural ramp-up that needs to occur in both execution of work on recently won contracts and on recruiting and hiring. As Horacio noted, we are focused on both of those priorities. They take time to ramp up, which creates a momentum built towards the back half of the year. \n Second, we saw unusually high productivity in the first half of fiscal year 2021, driving up revenue growth then slowing growth in the second half as staff utilization and PTO trends normalize. This dynamic will create challenging comps in the first half of fiscal year 2022. \n Third, we expect PTO trends to have an ongoing impact for the next few months. Although we executed a successful onetime PTO buyback program in the fourth quarter, we know that many of our employees still have elevated balances due to the pandemic. With vaccinations increasing and some are on the way, we expect and have been encouraging our people to take well-deserved time off. \n Lastly, our implementation of the new financial system will result in minor timing differences in the costing of labor. We do not expect this dynamic to materially impact our full year results. However, we do forecast approximately 50 basis points of revenue growth headwinds in each of our second and third quarters, recovered through a roughly 100 basis point tailwind in the fourth quarter. \n Putting it all together, we expect organic top line growth in the low single-digit range in the first half of fiscal year 2022 with a significant ramp into the third and fourth quarters. From an EBITDA perspective, a return to more normal indirect spending patterns and billable expense mix post-pandemic will drive some volatility in our quarterly margin profile. \n Now let me take you through our fiscal year 2022 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow between 7% and 10%, which is inclusive of a partial year contribution from our announced Liberty acquisition, assuming a first quarter 2022 close. The variance between the top and bottom end of our revenue growth outlook will largely depend on the successful execution and timing of our hiring and onboarding. \n We expect adjusted EBITDA margin to remain in the mid-10% range. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30. This range reflects strong organic growth, incremental D&A expense related to our new financial system, a higher effective tax rate and $0.20 to $0.24 of anticipated accretion from our acquisition of Liberty IT. This guidance is based on 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 22% to 24%. \n We expect operating cash flow to be between $800 million and $850 million, largely driven by our operational performance, lower cash tax payments and contributions from Liberty IT. And finally, we expect CapEx to be between $80 million and $100 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. \n In closing, we are extremely proud of our fiscal year 2021 performance. I want to thank our clients and the entire Booz Allen family for managing through a complex year. We have once again demonstrated our ability to effectively manage the business, invest in our people and deliver strong returns to our shareholders. We did all of this while weathering a tough macro environment, which gives us confidence in our strategy and positioning to succeed through any market condition. \n With that, Rubun, let's open the lines for questions. We don't think so. Historically, let's say, past 5 years, certainly, as these higher solution, IT solution capabilities have been in demand, clients have been willing to accept higher compensated folks in the labor categories as well as with the escalations tied to that. \n So from a fixed price standpoint, we manage our contracts well. We have the right risk mitigation oversight in place and have not experienced any unfortunate results in executing those types of contracts. The only point I would add is that ramping up our headcount is going to take some time. And it sort of speaks to Horacio's comment about choppiness. And we've built that into our guidance range. So if you look at the 4% to 7% organic portion of the 7% to 10%, where we will end up within that is really a timing of the headcount gain. But we're confident, our leaders are on it and we expect to do well. No, we don't see any differences from how we've operated the business in the past. It's really probably just a function of timing. But we expect strong conversion as we always have. And as you have seen historically, our cash generation has been really well. Yes. We -- every year, we go into it targeting mid-single digits. But as Horacio and I said last quarter, it's going to take some time to crank up to that point. So our commentary about first half buildup into sort of hitting our stride in the second half is reflective of this buildup. But we expect, as we go into every year, to improve on what we -- how we exited '21, and we're targeting mid-single digits. We do. We do. We've been consistently adding to our portfolio capabilities that are certainly in higher demand. Clients are rewarding us for that. And we see the profitability also improving, the execution of the work being stronger and stronger year-over-year. So we definitely see us remaining in that range going forward. Sure. Cai, as you may recall, we paid $725 million. The numbers I'm about to run through are assuming an all-cash financing. We expect to close in the first quarter of this fiscal year. We expect a partial year contribution of $300 million to $340 million annualized from Liberty. The adjusted EBITDA contribution will be somewhere between $46 million and $50 million. And the adjusted diluted EPS which you said is somewhere between $0.20 and $0.24. Yes. I mean it's hard to truly forecast billable expenses. But we do expect it to start to move more to the middle of our range, which has historically been 29% to 31%. So we certainly see the momentum picking up throughout the year and expect that when we get to the second half of the year, it will be maybe pre-pandemic, slightly less than pre-pandemic levels. Yes. I mean we did our best to reflect that in the guidance of 10.5%. We think that captures sort of the annual kind of puts and takes that we'll see as things start to return to normal. So we haven't -- I'm not going to try to give you a quarter-by-quarter sort of exits, but the 10.5%, I think, really captures our strong margins, and we're really happy about that. Yes. We haven't itemized it in terms of the dollar amount. But this is what I would offer to you. Certainly, in the first half of the year, we expect unallowables to remain low. We expect a return to average. CARES Act is sunsetting, so we expect to be able to invoice for fee going forward. So there will be, over the course of the year, this sort of shift from the midst of COVID to sort of pre-COVID dynamics. \n And then what I would say on the revenue side, I think you've heard it in Horacio's commentary, we're not demand constrained. I mean this is all about us bringing on the talent to convert the strong backlog performance and just solid client execution. So that's our top operational priority, and we'll work through the choppiness that we spoke about this morning, but we remain very optimistic. Yes."

Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's third quarter 2021 earnings announcement. We hope you have had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Rubun. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Today Lloyd and I will take you through our third quarter results and the dynamics that drove them and we will put the results in the context of the successful culmination of our three-year investment thesis and the strength of our business in the near and long-term. As you saw in our press release, we had a mixed quarter. Our revenue grew more slowly than expected. Conversely, our bottom line results, profit margins and cash flow are excellent and ahead of expectations. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have described three macro environmental factors that created uncertainty about our second half; the outcome of election, the status and outlook for the federal budget and the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me talk specifically about how those are playing out on the demand front, on the supply front and the impact on revenue and profits. Underlying demand for our services and solutions remains quite strong. In the third quarter, we saw delays in some procurement in the intelligence market largely due to the pandemic and in the civil market; we saw movement to the right  on awards and even some pull back on funding which we believe is due to turmoil surrounding the Presidential election.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks Horacio and good morning, everyone. As we approach the end of our 2021 fiscal year, a year of unprecedented challenge, we're proud of how well our people have consistently executed on our clients most important missions. As Horacio mentioned earlier in outlining our 2021 annual operating plan, we identified three major sources of uncertainty. The November election, the budget outlook and the COVID-19 pandemic. After an exceptional top line performance in the first half held by unusually strong staff utilization, we expected slower growth in the second half as PTO trends began to normalize. We also anticipated the potential for a slowdown in award activities following the November Presidential election. We factored these elements into the annual guidance we provided at the end of the second quarter. However, we did not correctly anticipate the timing and magnitude of the top line impact of those dynamics. Our cost management efforts to-date enabled us to hold the lines at adjusted EBITDA.\nRubun Dey: Thanks Lloyd. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator:  our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nCarter Copeland: Just two quick ones from me. One of these seems sort of strange to ask, but given the importance on the top line I guess it's important to know how it work. On the PTO impact to the extent, there's unused PTO for the staff on the year and you rolled that forward to next year. I realized you're not guiding for next year yet. But how should we think about, is there an impact of shifting some of that productivity impact into the following year that we should we mindful of as we think about next year's growth?\nLloyd Howell: I'll start, Carter. As we said, there were three main reasons for slower growth in Q3 and one of those is definitely tied to lower productivity than what we were running in the first half. If you look at the reasons for that, not only is entire PTO driven by lower available labor. But also lower staff utilization. So we definitely saw a snap back with productivity faster than what we expected. We think as things normalize, it will go back to as we said in our prepared remarks historic levels and we think that will occur over the next couple of quarters.\nCarter Copeland: Yes, I guess my question is Lloyd. Is there a way for thinking mathematically about it is there a way for to go beyond normalized because you've got built up balances of PTO then suddenly need to get burned down, if you know what I mean? So I guess I'm just asking what normalize mean I suppose.\nLloyd Howell: Yes, I mean for the balance of this year. We think its $50 million range and we're not at the moment seeing it any different than what we said or what we're seeing occur for the balance of this fiscal year.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. And then on the headcount impact of the getting out of the program. The strategic decision to get out of defense program. Can you quantify how big that was?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, it impacted about 300 of our folks most of which we redeployed onto other programs in our portfolio. But as we also indicated, we expect that it will continue to grow overtime. With regard to the divestiture that was about 120 people tied in our army account.\nCarter Copeland: Okay, thanks for the color, Lloyd.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Raviv of Citi. Your line is open.\nJon Raviv: So switching from sales to margin rate, Lloyd just your thoughts on the margin run rate clearly very strong here point higher for the year. Is that a new sort of base off of which you guys could improve this new efforts that you're making in new lines of business or maybe talk about the pressure perhaps as some of this COVID rolls off and people start to travel again and you start to spend all  money.\nLloyd Howell: Sure so, we're very pleased with our margin performance year-to-date. From our perspective it's a combination of strong execution of the portfolio as well as proven management of discretionary expenses. We didn't get here as you appreciate, overnight. It's been work in progress. But we believe that the things and the dynamics that have contributed to this will remain which is solid contract performance, management among allowable and also as we've made comments in our prepared remarks lower billable expense. Going forward, we're going to continue to invest long-term and in terms of hiring, rewarding our people, the infrastructure improvements that we mentioned and investing in capabilities. So we believe that the mid-to-high 10 range is sustainable and we're going to continue doing things that got us in this position.\nHoracio Rozanski: Jon, I'll just add couple of quick points. First one is, in some ways the margin percentage can be tied to the volatility of the billable expenses because as you know most of our margin comes from our labor. Having said that, I agree completely with Lloyd that our focus is on EBITDA dollar growth and that has been solid. It's been running ahead of revenue and even revenue its billable growth and that is conservative effort becoming more efficient and we're going to keep on that.\nJon Raviv: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: To go back to PTO, do you allow employees to carry PTO over from one year to the next or do they use it or lose it?\nLloyd Howell: We have a couple of programs, we have a use it or lose it by the end of this fiscal year and then on accrual basis, it sort of grows with the level and seniority of the individual. So portion of it will go away by the end of March.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it and then cyber clearly is a priority we had the Russian hack, Biden is basically putting $9 billion to update Federal IT infrastructure. Could you give us some color? I mean you say you're Ranked # 1 by Frost & Sullivan. But obviously you've got - any color you can give us on your business. Therefore example your position in the intel business which isn't covered by Frost & Sullivan. And maybe some metrics like what percent of your employees roughly are involved in cyber. And given the focus, I apologize the long question. How come we have the slip in the cyber program given the increasing priority?\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me try and start with that. I think Lloyd will probably want to chime in on your multi-part question, Cai. The first thing I would say is, our position in cyber is in fact even stronger in the intelligence community than it is broadly across the government or the commercial sector. The work that we do in intelligence is in some ways the crown jewel. Our cyber programs, we are very bullish on the medium term, long-term outlook for our entire cyber business including commercial which is why and we can talk later about the Tracepoint investment as a part of that. It's actually difficult to break down the specific numbers of how many people do this and how many people do that? Which is why we don't do it because we approach cyber from an all-admission approach. We look at the intersections between cyber and cloud, cyber and AI, cyber and 5G, cyber and intelligence and so forth. On the specific contract that you were asking about, what actually happened is, that contract was actually burning at a faster rate than it was programmed to do because of - frankly because of the increasing the attack surface  from so many people in the government working from home and alike and there was an expectation that the last administration would ramp up the funding to keep up with that and the last minute they chose not to do so. We believe that is temporary as you pointed out. The Biden administration is looking to make investments in cyber. We're talking to lot of our clients about the remediation from SolarWinds and so we see a lot of opportunity in that space and we're pursuing that opportunity very aggressively.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: I wanted to carry through on the cyber question. But maybe a little bit more on the commercial market. It's always been a little surprising to me that companies haven't utilized yourselves or other government contractors, cyber offerings more given you were the ones who were actually doing cyber for the US government and for the Department of Defense and the intel community presumably you've got some of the best capabilities in the world. So curios if you could talk about that dynamic if you think that nation states sponsored type attacks increase the commercial opportunity and how that could play out?\nHoracio Rozanski: We do Gavin. I think as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we're actually shifting our global commercial focus more back to the US and much more double down on cyber for this very reason. I think as the adversaries get more sophisticated and as clients get more sophisticated the demand for what we do grows. Quite frankly when we first go into commercial cyber, I think we were so far ahead of many of our clients that it was hard for them to consume, the type of cyber services, cyber capability that we could offer. Our clients are moving very fast or catching up. A lot of them are super sophisticated and so that's why we see significant opportunity and increase in demand. The Tracepoint investment is directly related to our desire to be more involved in incident response. We do a good level of incident response but that is a business that has evolved towards needing to have channel with insurance companies where early players obviously when an incident happens and so forth and Tracepoint does a spectacular job of that and we believe that, their ability to access our channel and our expertise can create real synergies and acceleration.\nGavin Parsons: Great, that's helpful. And then just coming up in your three-year plan and they're not guiding. I imagine it's difficult to predict the priorities - or how the priorities of the new administration will play out. What's your anticipation of what budgets will look like over the next few years and what that means for your top line growth relative to the last few years of elevated budget growth? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I think it's trying to predict too far out with the new administration just coming in and everything else is beyond what we should try to do. We are thinking in general that budgets are not going to grow as fast in the next few years as they grew in the last few years and so this is why we continue to invest and double down on these key technologies and capabilities that I talked about before cloud, cyber, AI, 5G because we believe that demand for those types of services will remain strong and in fact accelerate even as the overall budget gets potentially more constrained than it's been in the past and we believe that on two dynamics. One is because you can actually save a lot of money by implementing these technologies right and two, which is we'll focus on so far. You can enhance mission success again some of these very critical missions that. They're not going away if anything are becoming more important.\nGavin Parsons: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Was wondering if you could talk to the hiring plans and sort of reaccelerates your headcount growth and how that may influence continued margin expansions as part of your sort of next three-year plan? Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Sure I'll start. We have always pride ourselves on being a people first business, our employee value proposition plays into that. And we clearly are going to accelerate, pick up the pace from where we ended in Q3. There are couple of reasons we're confident that we're going to get there. The first as I mentioned is our employee value proposition the constant  of the work that we provide to our clients. The second, more of a mechanical point, over 30% of our  come from our existing workforce. So  have familiarity with Booz Allen understand what we're doing and accelerates the recruiting process. This is critically important because the labor market as we often appreciate was very competitive, pre-pandemic and in the midst of COVID as it remained so. So we're going to be even more so on the levers that we've historically done and then also increase the pipeline as I've mentioned. On a margin basis, this investment is going to put a little bit of downward pressure on where we are currently and this is historically what we've done in the fourth quarter anyway, which is really ramping up our people, our bench as we go into the next fiscal year. But even with that being said, we still are confident we're going to end up in the mid-to-high tens with margin.\nHoracio Rozanski: One other things I just to add - one last thought on this is, that I think is really interesting a good way about the fiscal year that we're about to end. Is we have managed to lower our overall cost position while increasing our investment in people? And I think that tells you how we're thinking about the business, what our priorities are and what we think about for the future.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you for that. My second question, could you speak to the most promising areas in the civil business under the Biden administration and discuss how your current portfolio lines up against those and maybe the areas where you have to position yourselves slightly different in order to capitalize on them. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I'll give you maybe a bird eye view on that. The largest part of our civil portfolio has been our health business and it continues to be - we saw during the Obama year significant investment by the country and significant agenda against healthcare access. We expect some version of that to reaccelerate under the Biden administration and that scenario where again I think Booz Allen is in a very good position to assist our clients, should things move in that direction. Our citizen's services business is going to be underpinning the overall digital transformation of our civil government which is also something that's being talked about not just from a cyber perspective but from the ability to move online. Many of the services that we citizens demand and are now expecting to see online. We need to think to step back and think about what role, we think we can play, if there's a significant environment agenda that has - we have a digital play into that. We need to consider whether we need or want a broader play in that area. But that is again under our consideration and as we think about our strategy. These are the kinds of questions we're asking ourselves but I keep coming back. We don't want to underpin all infrastructure, all technology. We want to leverage new technology into some of these areas of expansion and continue to be viewed by all of our clients as the people who insert new technology, new thinking, commercial best practices into their missions.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joseph Denardi of Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph Denardi: Lloyd, can you speak to M&A a bit maybe the nature of your pipeline, is that still a priority for capital deployment? Would you characterize the pipeline as smaller opportunities or larger and maybe just kind of your level of comfort in using equity to finance anything there? Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Sure, we believe as we said our balance sheet is certainly a strategic asset uncoupled with our strong generation of cash really puts us in a good position to not only pursue M&A opportunities but also as we did this quarter the uptick with the dividend and the increased authorization with our share repurchase program. Specifically regarding M&A, our pipeline has been growing consistent with the capabilities Horacio and I long talked about. Software systems development, AI, digital, data analytics and we're looking at a variety of opportunities and different ways to deploy that capital as we did with the Tracepoint investment. These are all different maturation points increasingly these are opportunities that we've cultivated which is been really good and consistent with the individual market strategies and where we think increased demands going to come with our clients. So as you know we have a pretty high bar, we have historically looked for capability tuck-ins. I'd characterize them as that's very much consistent with what we've always said. But I'm very pleased with the volume and remained confident that the inorganic contribution will pick up overtime.\nJoseph Denardi: Okay that's helpful. And then Horacio, can you just update us on the classified intel business or customer set there. Maybe how that's going with the semi recent leadership changes at this point and visibility you have been to - that customer again being a driver of growth for you all? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. It's always difficult on these calls to talk our intel business in any detail. But let me say the following, we're seeing more pick up in both proposal, opportunity and even some really interesting awards albeit small. Again the use of technology to help drive those missions. I think if we have fallen behind a little bit on that part of the business. Is we were not implementing or absorbing these new technologies into that business as quickly as we were in our defense and our civilian portfolio and that has changed?  over hand with some old contracts that frankly we were going to out of one way or the other and so the numbers as you see them right now reflect that mix shift that is working its way through the system. But I'm very optimistic about where that business is going. I think once the awards that we are expecting finally stop moving to the right and get awarded. I think in the next year see that business - I'd like to see for sure see that business return to a healthy growth rate. It's a good business and we do some really just extraordinary work there for our clients and our clients value it, which is really where it all begins for us. Is if our client value, we need to figure how to do more of it, how to do better and how to grow the business overtime.\nJoseph Denardi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma of William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Horacio, you've demonstrated a leadership in dating analytics in addition to AI and in 2018, you announced that you won a very strategic $885 million eMAPS contract or Machine Learning and Data Analytics. We have heard that there will be an eMAPS sequel contract that is significantly larger than the existing eMAPS contract something in the $1.5 billion range. And I was wondering because I thought your existing eMAPS contract had a five-year duration. Are they re-competing your existing contract and is the DoD happy and satisfied with your existing performance with machine learning, data analytics and AI in general? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me answer the sort of the last question first and work my back to the front of your question. The answer is yes. Across all of our work, we continue our leadership on AI, on data analytics, on machine learning and on being able to deliver those kinds of capabilities to mission, eMAPS being one of those examples our work at the J  demonstrates that and so many other places. I don't want to speak specifically about any one contract on this call. But I will say this, it is not unusual for contracts to run out of ceiling ahead of the five-year timeline and I think that is in some ways a demonstration that there's so much value being created that was originally expect a ceiling that was originally expected to last five years. Sometimes gets work through in three or four. Again not because the clients see so much value that the missions that expands and then recomplete will come along and the recomplete will be larger to accommodate. Call it the higher annual burn rate in the contract and so, we have a good number of contracts in our portfolio some very large ones that actually will get competed early and almost every time it's because again there's been mission expansion because of the quality of the services being provided in the contract not because the client is dissatisfied with the services.\nLouie DiPalma: Thanks Horacio, that's all I had. That was very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nBen Arnstein: This is actually Ben on for Seth. I guess I wanted to go back to the questions about revenue. The high end of the guidance for this year implies another quarter of growth at about 3% in Q4. I guess how should we think about the trajectory of organic growth beyond this year. It sounds like some of the issues are going to last couple of quarters. So any color you can give on that. And then is it still reasonable to think about getting to inorganic growth rate that was something closer to the original guidance for this year as you moved past some of these headwinds?\nLloyd Howell: The balance of the year as we said in our prepared remarks. There are couple of dynamics that would have to be less than what we're expecting. Certainly the impact of billable expenses that we have launched that were focused on revenue ex-billable expenses that has an impact on revenue as you know. So that is not as much of a headwind than what we're expecting that sort of helps a lot and then the productivity topic that we talked about, where we're seeing a normalization with available labor and PTO usage. If that were to slow down or feather down like we had originally expected we could see that become a contribution to getting toward the high end of the range. And then lastly, the one that Horacio and I feel we have a fair amount of control on is recruiting. If we execute in a manner that we expect to, it will slowly build back up and would also be a tailwind to pushing us to the top end of the range. I think it's too early to get into looking out beyond the next couple of quarters and as we've said, we expect this to be a building process. But at the appropriate time we'll give guidance as to what FY 2022 is going to look like.\nHoracio Rozanski:  let me build on that and leave you with three thoughts perhaps. The first one is, as we've discussed during this whole call. We view our business as very robust with lots of opportunities in the pipeline. Timing is a bit uncertain but we're well positioned to win in the market and the medium and long-term trends we believe are in our favor. Point number two as Lloyd said, we expect top line performance to be a little choppy for the next couple of quarters potentially into the early quarters of next year. But we have some work to do both around capturing the opportunities that are out there and ramping them up as quickly as our clients will allow us and hiring aggressively against them and we are all over that. And then the last point that I don't want to lose is, how strong our bottom line performance has been, how solid it is even with some volatility at the top line and the expectation that will also continue overtime.\nBen Arnstein: Great, thank you.\nOperator: There are no further question. I'd like to turn the call back over to Horacio Rozanski for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you everyone for your questions. I hope the discussion today gives you a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving our third quarter performance and our areas of focus going forward both in the near and in the long-term. As an institution that has evolved and succeeded for more than a century. Booz Allen is constantly striving to improve and we are especially focused on living up to our purpose, empowering people to change the world. So on that note, I'd like to close today by calling attention to our recently released environmental, social and governance impact report. It is another way for us to convey our firm's aspirations, our vision and our impact. Today our stakeholders have broad expectations for transparency. Our clients and our investors, non-profits and community partners, regulators and suppliers and especially our employees. They all want to understand a company's values and performance as a corporate citizen. Our 2020 EGS impact report takes a fresh approach to providing that transparency. It's informed by our stakeholders and is aligned to the GRI standards. The world's most widely used standards for corporate sustainability reporting. It's a snapshot in time and will evolve as we mature the governance and measurement of our corporate impact. If you haven't yet seen it, the report is called The Future Can't Wait and it is available on our website. I invite you to take a look. Once again thank you for your time and your participation this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Today Lloyd and I will take you through our third quarter results and the dynamics that drove them and we will put the results in the context of the successful culmination of our three-year investment thesis and the strength of our business in the near and long-term.

Timing is a bit uncertain but we're well positioned to win in the market and the medium and long-term trends we believe are in our favor. Point number two as Lloyd said, we expect top line performance to be a little choppy for the next couple of quarters potentially into the early quarters of next year. But we have some work to do both around capturing the opportunities that are out there and ramping them up as quickly as our clients will allow us and hiring aggressively against them and we are all over that. And then the last point that I don't want to lose is, how strong our bottom line performance has been, how solid it is even with some volatility at the top line and the expectation that will also continue overtime. Thank you everyone for your questions. I hope the discussion today gives you a deeper understanding of the dynamics driving our third quarter performance and our areas of focus going forward both in the near and in the long-term. As an institution that has evolved and succeeded for more than a century. Booz Allen is constantly striving to improve and we are especially focused on living up to our purpose, empowering people to change the world. So on that note, I'd like to close today by calling attention to our recently released environmental, social and governance impact report. It is another way for us to convey our firm's aspirations, our vision and our impact. Today our stakeholders have broad expectations for transparency. Our clients and our investors, non-profits and community partners, regulators and suppliers and especially our employees. They all want to understand a company's values and performance as a corporate citizen. Our 2020 EGS impact report takes a fresh approach to providing that transparency. It's informed by our stakeholders and is aligned to the GRI standards. The world's most widely used standards for corporate sustainability reporting. It's a snapshot in time and will evolve as we mature the governance and measurement of our corporate impact. If you haven't yet seen it, the report is called The Future Can't Wait and it is available on our website. I invite you to take a look. Once again thank you for your time and your participation this morning and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks Horacio and good morning, everyone. As we approach the end of our 2021 fiscal year, a year of unprecedented challenge, we're proud of how well our people have consistently executed on our clients most important missions. As Horacio mentioned earlier in outlining our 2021 annual operating plan, we identified three major sources of uncertainty. The November election, the budget outlook and the COVID-19 pandemic. After an exceptional top line performance in the first half held by unusually strong staff utilization, we expected slower growth in the second half as PTO trends began to normalize. We also anticipated the potential for a slowdown in award activities following the November Presidential election. We factored these elements into the annual guidance we provided at the end of the second quarter. However, we did not correctly anticipate the timing and magnitude of the top line impact of those dynamics. Our cost management efforts to-date enabled us to hold the lines at adjusted EBITDA. I'll start, Carter. As we said, there were three main reasons for slower growth in Q3 and one of those is definitely tied to lower productivity than what we were running in the first half. If you look at the reasons for that, not only is entire PTO driven by lower available labor. But also lower staff utilization. So we definitely saw a snap back with productivity faster than what we expected. We think as things normalize, it will go back to as we said in our prepared remarks historic levels and we think that will occur over the next couple of quarters. Yes, I mean for the balance of this year. We think its $50 million range and we're not at the moment seeing it any different than what we said or what we're seeing occur for the balance of this fiscal year. Yes, it impacted about 300 of our folks most of which we redeployed onto other programs in our portfolio. But as we also indicated, we expect that it will continue to grow overtime. With regard to the divestiture that was about 120 people tied in our army account. Sure so, we're very pleased with our margin performance year-to-date. From our perspective it's a combination of strong execution of the portfolio as well as proven management of discretionary expenses. We didn't get here as you appreciate, overnight. It's been work in progress. But we believe that the things and the dynamics that have contributed to this will remain which is solid contract performance, management among allowable and also as we've made comments in our prepared remarks lower billable expense. Going forward, we're going to continue to invest long-term and in terms of hiring, rewarding our people, the infrastructure improvements that we mentioned and investing in capabilities. So we believe that the mid-to-high 10 range is sustainable and we're going to continue doing things that got us in this position. We have a couple of programs, we have a use it or lose it by the end of this fiscal year and then on accrual basis, it sort of grows with the level and seniority of the individual. So portion of it will go away by the end of March. Sure I'll start. We have always pride ourselves on being a people first business, our employee value proposition plays into that. And we clearly are going to accelerate, pick up the pace from where we ended in Q3. There are couple of reasons we're confident that we're going to get there. The first as I mentioned is our employee value proposition the constant  of the work that we provide to our clients. The second, more of a mechanical point, over 30% of our  come from our existing workforce. So  have familiarity with Booz Allen understand what we're doing and accelerates the recruiting process. This is critically important because the labor market as we often appreciate was very competitive, pre-pandemic and in the midst of COVID as it remained so. So we're going to be even more so on the levers that we've historically done and then also increase the pipeline as I've mentioned. On a margin basis, this investment is going to put a little bit of downward pressure on where we are currently and this is historically what we've done in the fourth quarter anyway, which is really ramping up our people, our bench as we go into the next fiscal year. But even with that being said, we still are confident we're going to end up in the mid-to-high tens with margin. Sure, we believe as we said our balance sheet is certainly a strategic asset uncoupled with our strong generation of cash really puts us in a good position to not only pursue M&A opportunities but also as we did this quarter the uptick with the dividend and the increased authorization with our share repurchase program. Specifically regarding M&A, our pipeline has been growing consistent with the capabilities Horacio and I long talked about. Software systems development, AI, digital, data analytics and we're looking at a variety of opportunities and different ways to deploy that capital as we did with the Tracepoint investment. These are all different maturation points increasingly these are opportunities that we've cultivated which is been really good and consistent with the individual market strategies and where we think increased demands going to come with our clients. So as you know we have a pretty high bar, we have historically looked for capability tuck-ins. I'd characterize them as that's very much consistent with what we've always said. But I'm very pleased with the volume and remained confident that the inorganic contribution will pick up overtime. The balance of the year as we said in our prepared remarks. There are couple of dynamics that would have to be less than what we're expecting. Certainly the impact of billable expenses that we have launched that were focused on revenue ex-billable expenses that has an impact on revenue as you know. So that is not as much of a headwind than what we're expecting that sort of helps a lot and then the productivity topic that we talked about, where we're seeing a normalization with available labor and PTO usage. If that were to slow down or feather down like we had originally expected we could see that become a contribution to getting toward the high end of the range. And then lastly, the one that Horacio and I feel we have a fair amount of control on is recruiting. If we execute in a manner that we expect to, it will slowly build back up and would also be a tailwind to pushing us to the top end of the range. I think it's too early to get into looking out beyond the next couple of quarters and as we've said, we expect this to be a building process. But at the appropriate time we'll give guidance as to what FY 2022 is going to look like."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Booz Allen Hamilton's earnings call covering second quarter results for fiscal year 2021. [Operator Instructions]\n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rubun Dey. \nRubun Dey: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's second quarter 2021 earnings announcement. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2.\n I'm Rubun Dey, Head of Investor Relations. And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\n As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and, therefore, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer included in our second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings.\n We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call.\n During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2021 slides.\n It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 5. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Rubun, and welcome to our team. We're glad to have you on board. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call.\n Lloyd and I are excited to announce Booz Allen's fiscal year 2021 second quarter results this morning. Our firm's performance in this very challenging year has been truly outstanding, and we are proud to discuss the collective accomplishments of the more than 27,000 professionals who work every day in support of our clients, each other and this institution.\n As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered excellent second quarter results across all metrics. The numbers support our 3-year investment thesis objectives and our growth plan for this fiscal year.\n When our fiscal year opened, only weeks into the disruptions of COVID-19, we recommitted to flawless execution even amid uncertainty, and that's exactly what we have delivered: strong growth at the top and bottom lines, a profit margin that is above historical norms, strong cash generation and continued success in recruiting talent, building our pipeline and capturing opportunities.\n Our growth in the second quarter was fueled by continued strength in our defense and civil businesses. This reflects the value clients place on our offerings and on the talent of our team. Our intelligence business has stabilized in the first half of this fiscal year despite facing unique challenges due to the pandemic. We have a new leader in place and feel confident about future growth. And finally, in global commercial, we expect a modest decline this fiscal year driven by overall economic conditions.\n Looking at the first half of the fiscal year, our financial results show that, to date, Booz Allen has successfully navigated the complexities of COVID-19. We continued to execute against the proven strategy, made operational adjustments as needed and supported our people in new ways so they could focus on clients' critical missions.\n Our unique combination of the right strategy, operating model, people and culture created a first half performance that exceeded even our own expectations. And so today, we are pleased to narrow our guidance range for fiscal year 2021 revenue and raise guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operating cash. Lloyd will walk through our performance and updated guidance in more detail in a few minutes.\n First, I'll talk briefly about where our management team is focused, both near and long term. Let's start with the near term.\n Since our fiscal year began, we have talked with you about 3 areas of uncertainty in the second half. First, the course and impacts of COVID-19 in the fall and winter, and especially now, as infections are spiking again across the country; second, the potential for funding disruption after the current continuing resolution expires December 11; and third, the outcome and implications of next week's election. These macro variables are major sources of uncertainty for both our country and our industry. But based on our operating and financial performance in the first half and the strength of our balance sheet, I believe Booz Allen is well positioned to outperform our market despite the potential turbulence in the coming months.\n As I noted last quarter, we believe these dynamics in the macro environment could create opportunities as well. This year, we anticipated and planned for increased volatility in the economy, financial markets and federal budget outlook. This allows us to scan the market from a position of strength, looking for opportunities to build our business, forge strategic partnerships, invest in capabilities, deploy capital and so on. As always, the overriding objective is to maximize value for our firm and our shareholders. With that as a segue, let me shift to the long term.\n Here at Booz Allen, our work is never done. Beyond the excellent operational performance of our team, our business leaders are making great progress on several future-oriented initiatives. For example, we continue to shape our portfolio of business towards high-value work where emerging technologies meet needs at the center of clients' missions. Our strategic review is progressing and we expect to share results with you next summer.\n We continue to develop and deploy our option value initiatives. We are constantly evaluating and strengthening our employee value proposition, including making good progress against the race and social equity agenda we shared with you last quarter. And we are modernizing and investing in our IT and financial infrastructure to support new ways of working, new business lines and additional growth.\n Taken together, these efforts are designed to make our firm even stronger and more successful in the years to come. Staying focused on the future, while at the same time, managing unexpected disruptions and normal ups and downs of business cycles is the job of every leader in this firm.\n Having said that, none of this, none of this would be possible without the entire Booz Allen team. They deserve tremendous credit for our first half performance, our position of strength as we head into what could be a challenging few months and our continued progress on strategic initiatives.\n So before I turn the call over to Lloyd, let me close with a few words directly to my colleagues who are listening. You'll remember, back in April, with our pandemic resilience fund, we made a safe bet. If the firm had your back, you would have the firm's back. You would give Booz Allen and our clients your very best. And in the last 7 months, you've done that and then some. You invented new ways of working practically overnight. You continued to go into critical client facilities with masks and all the right precautions to make sure important missions got done without interruption. You came up with creative ways to connect with each other and build community. You showed courage to both ask for help and to give help to those in need. And you executed all business functions with great precision and skill.\n Truth is what we've faced together in 2020 was simply unthinkable a year ago. As problem solvers, you have risen to the challenge. You have persevered through it all. And that's great. As we knew you to be, you've exceeded our expectations.\n So on behalf of the entire leadership team and in front of our external stakeholders, please accept our gratitude. We are in it together and our firm is better for it. Thank you for all you have done and all you will continue to do.\n And with that, Lloyd, over to you. \nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing your thanks to our colleagues. This firm has truly rallied to meet the challenges of 2020. It shows in the financial results we're announcing this morning and in many other ways that numbers can't easily capture. We are now halfway through our fiscal year, an extraordinary 6-month period for the country as well as our company. In these challenging times, our clients have continued to rely on Booz Allen's leadership and capabilities in support of their missions. I am enormously proud of our performance.\n Our outstanding second quarter results maintain and build on our first quarter performance, showcasing our reliability and execution. Consistent with our position as the industry leader, we continue to see robust organic growth, with headcount expanding and total backlog reaching a new record high. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and this gives us great confidence that our firm can manage any potential challenges in the next few months. Thanks to our prudent financial management, we also have the ability to take advantage of opportunities as they emerge, whether in the debt, equity or M&A markets.\n I'll now run through our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 11% and 10.6%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year. The primary driver of our growth was ongoing demand for our services. We benefited from staff utilization above historic norms that was driven by fewer PTO days taken by our employees.\n Turning to headcount. We ended the quarter with 27,638 employees, up 654 or 2.4% year-over-year and up 257 since the end of June. In a challenging labor market, we are pleased with our performance to date.\n On Slide 7, you'll see that total backlog increased 7% to $24.6 billion. Funded backlog was up 2% to $4.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 15% to $6.2 billion, and priced options rose 6% to $13.9 billion.\n Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.8x, and our last 12 months book-to-bill was 1.2x. The quarterly number is lower than our recent second quarters and, frankly, slightly lower than our expectations. That said, we expect continued volatility with our quarterly book-to-bill pattern as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids.\n First half book-to-bill was 2.0x, in line with our historical norm. Our bookings expectation for the full fiscal year remains unchanged with a number of large award opportunities in our second half pipeline.\n Year-to-date, COVID-19 has not slowed the award environment. While credit is due to the diligence of our team at Booz Allen, we must also acknowledge the efforts of our clients and contracting officers, many of whom continue to work remotely through the busy government year-end procurement season.\n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $228 million, up 19% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, our highest quarterly result since 2015. These increases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin were driven by top line growth, strong contract level performance, ongoing cost management efforts and reductions in certain types of expenses like travel and meetings. These were partially offset by our inability to bill for fee on shift work performed in our defense and intelligence markets.\n In the quarter, the negative fee impact was approximately $7 million. Going forward, we expect unbilled fee to have a negligible impact to earnings as the majority of affected staff have returned to client site offices or are expected to do so shortly.\n Second quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 19% and 25% year-over-year to $136 million and $143 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.98, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.03. These increases were primarily due to revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement, with support from lower interest expenses and reduced share count due to our share repurchase program.\n Transitioning to cash. We generated $426 million in operating cash during the second quarter, an increase of 97% over the prior year. This represents the strongest quarterly operating cash result since our IPO. Cash ended the quarter at $1.3 billion.\n Operating cash flow performance was primarily due to the overall growth of the business, working capital management and lower cash taxes due to the carryover of R&D credits we claimed at the end of last year. Lower cash disbursements also contributed to the second quarter performance driven by cost management and lower expenses attributable to COVID.\n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $18 million. This year, we continue to prioritize technology and tools that enable a virtual work environment. Also, we are nearing implementation of our next-generation financial system, which will support the company's growth into the future. Please turn to Slide 8.\n During the quarter, we repurchased $30 million worth of shares at an average price of $76 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $73 million to shareholders. We are exiting the second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet. We continue to view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, especially in times of volatility. We are committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through patient, disciplined capital allocation. We see ourselves as well placed to quickly capitalize upon opportunities as they may arise over the coming months.\n In our investment thesis, we set a 70% to 80% ADEPS growth target over a 3-year period ending this fiscal year, supported by $1.4 billion in capital deployment. We are well positioned to meet our ADEPS goal organically as reflected in our updated fiscal year guidance. As a result, while deploying the remainder of our capital target remains our objective, we will remain patient and disciplined toward our deployment strategy to meet this objective.\n Today, we are announcing that the company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 16. On August 24, we issued $700 million in senior notes that are due in 2028. We used the proceeds to pay down our $350 million in senior notes due in 2025 and to strengthen our balance sheet while meaningfully reducing the interest rate.\n Before opening the line for questions, I'll briefly touch on our view of the rest of the year and our guidance. Please move to Slide 9.\n We are very pleased to be raising our expectations for the fiscal year, even with ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19, the federal budget and next week's election. This improved outlook is the product of several things: our excellent first half performance, the fundamental strength of our institution and our confidence in the skill and agility of our leaders and teams. Throughout the rest of the fiscal year, we'll make operational adjustments as needed and stand ready to jump on opportunities that emerge. Let me run through the numbers.\n For the full fiscal year, we are tightening our revenue range and expect growth between 7% and 9%. We now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be in the low to mid-10% range. We have raised and narrowed the range for adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.60 and $3.75. The ADEPS guidance is based on 136 million to 140 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%.\n On operating cash, we are forecasting between $600 million and $650 million for the full year. And finally, our outlook for capital expenditures is unchanged at $80 million to $100 million.\n As we look into our fiscal year second half and prepare for an eventual return to normalcy, we will spend a portion of the funding that we previously set aside for weathering the pandemic. We expect to hire aggressively to sustain our growth and plan to reward our talent for their impressive execution to date. We will also implement our new financial system that further supports our business leaders. In short, we will continue to invest in our people and our long-term growth initiatives.\n Our updated guidance reflects the traditional seasonality of some of our expenses and anticipated return to more typical patterns of labor utilization, ongoing strategic investments, and the aforementioned uncertainty around COVID, the elections and the overall budget and funding environment. The next few months will be difficult to navigate. However, as our new guidance indicates, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, execute and win regardless of the environment.\n In closing, we are extremely proud of our second quarter results. Despite the challenges we all now face daily, our people have responded with energy and dedication. As we head into the second half, the entire management team is excited about our continued success and focused on maintaining our industry leadership for the remainder of the year and beyond.\n With that, Rubun, let's open the lines for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: Maybe one question for you, Horacio. What's driving profitability increases, not only in the quarter but your 3-year framework? Can you talk about some of the option value programs? Or have they not been embedded into the near-term outlook just yet? \nHoracio Rozanski: Great question, and thank you for -- let me set maybe a little bit of context and then go deeper into that question. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the business in the first half, especially under the current circumstances. I think it speaks to, certainly, the commitment that our clients have to the mission, to the brains and the heart that our people brought forward. And I think it also speaks to the fact that we have both an operating model and a strategy that works well in good times but really can shine in challenging times. So I think that's what we're beginning to see.\n In that context, over the last 3 years, as Lloyd always points out, it's really been disciplined execution, operational excellence and the ability to drive the business towards this Vision 2020 target of mission technology intersection at the center of what's most important to our clients that has really driven both our growth and our profitability. And I think that's what continues to drive it today.\n I'm excited about the options value portfolio. There's a number of initiatives there. We're making good progress across the portfolio. And I think we'll have more to say about that in the future. I'll tell you, as an anecdote, for example, we were concerned going into the year about Rec.gov because it's a tourism-driven business. It turns out the national parks has been the one area of tourism that has really done well. And so we have, in fact, leapfrogged a little bit of what we expected to see in terms of both growth and profitability in that program.\n But having said that, the option value portfolio still is a very small portion of our business and one where we are optimistic will grow and become more relevant in the coming years. Right now, this is really being driven by the excellent performance of the team. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Melius Research. \nPhillip Copeland: Just a couple of quick ones. Horacio, just -- I wonder if you could speak to kind of what this ongoing environment is revealing in terms of trends around retention and any challenges around hiring or if that's all going as usual despite the challenge.\n And then as a follow-up, a second question. In terms of commercial and your comments there, do you expect a bounce in that portion of the business next year? Or is that just going to take longer as we sort our way on the back end of COVID? \nHoracio Rozanski: I'll get started. Lloyd might want to jump in as well. Carter, on your first question, I'll say, nothing is business as usual at this point. Everything has had to be reinvented and retooled to match the current environment. We saw some decreases in attrition as a result of the environment. Obviously pleased with those. And it's a challenging labor market. It continues to be. I know some sectors of the economy don't look this way, but the talent that we look for, especially the technology talent, is still in very high demand.\n And I'm pleased with the performance through the first 6 months. I think we've hired a lot of great people, again, a lot of the right people to help us grow our business. And I think the future looks bright as it relates to the talent pool that we are looking for. I think what we've done, frankly, over the last 6 months, if anything, has strengthened our brand in the talent markets, and I think that will pay dividends not just now but in the out years.\n What was your -- sorry, global commercial. So we expected going into this year to be challenging for our global commercial business, both in our international, which is mostly Middle East footprint, and our U.S. domestic footprint. I think we -- what happened in the international business, in some ways, has been a little more dire than we expected, especially given the disruptions in Beirut where a lot of our talent resides. And that's a business that is in transition for us.\n But having said that, the results in the U.S., which is largely a cyber business, have been potentially better than we expected. So when you put it all together, I think that, that business is balancing itself in the right direction. It's still only about 3% of our total revenue base, but it plays an important strategic role and important branding role to the overall portfolio. And as we've always said, the margins are also strong. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sharpe from Morgan Stanley. \nMatthew Sharpe: Nice quarter. Horacio, a question for you. With 5G becoming a top priority for the DoD and Booz Allen's strength and systems integration, how are you thinking about the opportunity there? Could we see this potentially emerge as an option value initiative for the company? And are there any other emerging areas within the DoD or broader federal government that you see as potentially rising to that sort of option value initiative level for the company? \nHoracio Rozanski: Matt, just to be sure, you're asking about 5G? \nMatthew Sharpe: Yes, sir. \nHoracio Rozanski: Okay. Great. Absolutely, you are breaking up a little bit. I think Lloyd is feeling a little lonely here in the Q&A section, but I'll get started. I'll get us started. I think the answer is absolutely. I think 5G is emerging as an important set of technology. It's really a family of technologies. It's not one thing. It's not just millimeter wave. And that family of technologies is of increased importance, not just in the commercial market but across the government, including DoD. There are cyber implications of 5G. There's operational implications of 5G. There's the ability to move both processing and information to the edge in a way that it would advantage many missions.\n And I am proud of the fact that, much like everything else in our innovation agenda, we saw this relatively early. We began to position for it, and we have some really interesting work going on across the government that, in my mind, begins to define us as a thought leader in this area, much like we are a thought leader in AI. And by the way, these 2 technologies ultimately do travel together.\n So more to think about that, more to say about that. If you ask me, is that a big part of the portfolio? They're not. We're not scaling there like we have scaled in AI already. But I think the future is bright, and I think we're well positioned. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons from Goldman Sachs. \nGavin Parsons: Horacio, maybe a bit of a higher-level question. In the past, you said your growth is not constrained by demand but kind of more so by your ability to hire and then ramp up the work. So I'm just curious, when you think about growth pacing or maybe planning for growth, do you say we want to grow 6% to 10% this year and we'll hire to make that happen? Or is it -- we think we can hire and integrate enough people to grow 6% to 10%, so that's our target? \nHoracio Rozanski: That's a really good question, and I think the answer is yes. We've narrowed to 7% to 9%. We're proud of the fact that we're going to have a strong growth year in the middle of a pandemic and with very strong profitability.\n But I think that sort of the broader answer to the question is we still see very strong demand signals for the type of work that we're doing, for the type of capability that we bring to our clients. We are being choosy, if you will, in terms of both the work that we choose to pursue and the people that we're hiring to make sure that they are consistent with this intersection of core mission issues and next-generation technology because we believe that it's both the most promising and the most resilient part of the market as the market experiences some turbulence.\n And so the numbers that we're putting out are not the very most we could possibly grow if we were more sort of -- if we were less discriminate about the work that we're doing, these are the numbers that give us both excellent financial performance in the near term but we believe sustainability into the medium and long term. \nGavin Parsons: Cool. And then maybe following on that, just -- and looking at backlog growth over the last few years and just a lot of that being driven by price options. Do those price options have a finite life that you need to execute on within a certain time frame or funding expires? And I'm just kind of thinking about that in the context of maybe a more challenged budget environment ahead where the contracting officers might have to make more difficult decisions on what to fund. \nLloyd Howell: I'll jump in here. We see priced options as a leading indicator in a couple of different ways: one, our clients' confidence regarding what they'd like to do or tasks they'd like to turn on; and then secondly, their satisfaction with Booz Allen and our delivery up to that point.\n The timing of them is really dictated by the contract -- the underlying contract. So there's some variability depending upon the period of performance. But by and large, if you look at the unfunded and priced options portions of our backlog, they tend to convert anywhere between 60% and 70%, funded obviously at or near 100%.\n And so as Horacio has always said, we don't feel demand constrained at all. In fact, this quarter indicates with an increase to $24.6 billion, we've got the work. It then turns to can we attract, onboard and deploy the talent to convert that backlog. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair. \nLouie Dipalma: During the quarter, you announced SnapAttack, and this followed your previous internal development of Modzy. If you experience significant success with these types of internal development effort, should we expect for you to double down on internal R&D? And is the defense department and the overall federal government growing more receptive to this type of procurement versus traditional procurement? \nHoracio Rozanski: I think the short form of the answer is yes with the following color to it. There's -- we've been talking for quite some time about the fact that the digital assets, whether it's data or software, are becoming a bigger part of the value that is created in -- for our clients. And so the -- we're -- and we've been part of this digital transformation that is sweeping through the federal government. And the government and DoD, in particular, are trying to think hard about how to procure these types of capabilities and these types of assets in a way that they can do it faster, more reliably, more repeatably because this moves at digital speed.\n And I think Booz Allen is, honestly, maybe a little modestly, doing a great job across the board, not just in terms of coming up with our own proprietary solutions but of partnering with other technology firms to make sure that their proprietary solutions can actually add mission value. It's this intersection of mission and technology. Where we excel is the ability to take not just one piece of software or one technology but a portfolio to solve a meaningful mission problem, whether it is a cyber defense of critical infrastructure, whether it is using AI to improve customer service or to improve intelligence production. It's never really one thing, it's a combination of a number of things.\n And inside that combination, technology such as Modzy can play both an important role in advancing the mission but also give us an additional layer of differentiation. So that's how we look at it. It's in the overall context as opposed to -- we have this one piece of software or this one unique capability. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: Horacio, terrific results, as usual. So Lloyd, you have terrific revenue growth, and yet this is the sixth quarter in a row that your year-over-year headcount growth has decelerated. 2.4%, that's way below where your revenues are. Where does that have to be to kind of keep the revenues more or less in the range you're talking about? And what are you doing to hire that in what has to be a very tough environment? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. Well, thank you, Cai. First, let me say, we're very pleased with our ability to source and attract the talent that we have, and particularly given the unique circumstances that I think we're all facing into. From an arithmetic standpoint, even at 2.4%, with a combination of increased salary, a broader base of staff that's available and, frankly, utilization rates that are unprecedented, the conversion of that certainly places us in our forecasted range of 7% to 9%.\n Our work is never done. We know that we're going to have to remain as aggressive and diligent in finding this technical staff. We're working closely with our business leaders, our recruiting engine to increase the yield. But given how we forecasted the rest of the remainder of the year, we're confident that we'll be able to bring on the right talent. \nCai Von Rumohr: Terrific. And the second question is your G&A ratios are really terrific. And you mentioned that there is a benefit to COVID in terms of less travel and less meeting expense. Can you talk a little bit about the net benefits of COVID to your P&L? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. It's a great question, awkward one to answer without sounding callous regarding the impact that it's had on our workforce and people. But the bottom line financially is that our people are not taking PTO as they were pre-COVID. That translates into higher utilization. As you mentioned in your question, there are savings on travel, conferences, meals, other discretionary expenses. And ultimately, we're seeing a reduction in overhead expenses.\n We feel we're well positioned from a P&L perspective for the balance of the year. Certainly, as we weigh into the uncertainties that Horacio and I have talked about, our resilient program that we stood up at the beginning of the year, we still have a significant portion that remains to ride through the next spike if it comes to that. And we've learned a lot in terms of the current environment regarding telework, as you've heard in my prepared remarks around CapEx, our investment in our infrastructure. So we see a strong P&L, which will give us the strength and the resiliency as we navigate the next few months. \nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, if I can jump in. I would connect actually your 2 questions in the following way. It's -- the strength of the first half and the way in which we've managed the business with focus and with discipline actually allows us to do 2 things in the second half. One, we're happy to raise ADEPS guidance, of course. But two, it also frees up resources for us to recruit more aggressively, to invest in key capabilities more aggressive and to position us for future growth, even more aggressively than we would have otherwise. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers from Barclays. \nMatthew Akers: Maybe one for you, Lloyd. I was wondering if you could just comment on free cash flow kind of beyond fiscal '21. I'm sure you don't want to give guidance yet for '22, but just thinking of this year, there's working capital benefit, potentially some onetime items around the CARES Act that maybe don't repeat next year. So maybe if you could just talk about confidence and ability to grow free cash flow beyond '21 and kind of where the big moving pieces are there. \nLloyd Howell: Sure. Thank you. I'm going to keep my comments to this fiscal year, but let me say that I couldn't be pleased with our ability to generate cash. It really has been helped by onetime events, but also our core cash growth and effective working capital has really been the underlying story.\n What we see now is that elections were very high. We saw less in cash taxes that were paid, flat payables and then reduction in disbursements, be it PTO, medical, travel and corporate salaries. We expect in the second half for that to normalize a bit. So when you look at what we are forecasting in terms of operating cash for the year, that's how we get to the $600 million to $650 million.\n I believe that with the improvements that we've made over the past couple of years, that they truly are now institutionalized. We're always never satisfied, so we'll be looking for ways to continue to improve on that. But I think it tees us up well for the future. \nMatthew Akers: Okay. And then I guess -- apologize if I missed this earlier, but I guess the run rate impact you're seeing now from the employees on kind of ready state, you're just getting reimbursed at cost versus earning a profit. I think that was like a $6 million a month run rate earlier in the year. Can you give us an update where that is at this point? \nLloyd Howell: Are you referring to our inability to invoice for fee tied to the CARES Act? \nMatthew Akers: Yes. \nLloyd Howell: Oh, yes. So we originally forecasted -- I think it was $5 million to $7 million per month. And we saw in Q1 that it was more like $4 million per month. And in Q2, it dropped off even more. And that's really a function of folks returning to support their clients in their space as well as our space originally in a shift to work arrangement.\n And so as we said in our prepared remarks, we don't see that being significant going forward. We're in close discussions with our clients and contracting officers to make sure we're both seeing it the same way, but all credit due to our clients and our people to manage that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv from Citi. \nColin Canfield: It's Colin Canfield on for Jon. If you can just talk a little bit about your underlying health portfolio with respect to the capabilities that you have there and how they're positioned to address any potential shift in spending priorities. And then kind of zooming out back a little bit to capital deployment, the types of capabilities that you guys are looking for and can add opportunistically. \nHoracio Rozanski: I guess I'll start. We were -- nested in our civil business primarily is an outstanding health business that is really a leader in this industry, especially in helping our clients drive their digital transformation, which is, of course, a major issue affecting health care. It also has a tremendous level of actual health expertise on the science side, on the epidemiology side, on the care delivery side and then the insurance payment and so forth. And so it's been called to help already as COVID has redrawn the health environment around the nation, and it will continue to do so. So we see continued growth and opportunity in our health portfolio, certainly, over the many coming years as this is a national priority, together with the other national priorities we support.\n And I think -- I can't remember what the second question was. I think that was for you. \nLloyd Howell: Horacio, I'll take the capital deployment. Jon, we continue to deploy capital, as we say, in a patient and disciplined manner, both in the short, near and long term. And with the balance sheet that we view as a strategic asset, it really tees us up well.\n Our priorities around capital deployment haven't changed regarding M&A. As we've always said, we've got a traditional focus on capability tuck-ins. In today's environment, we're looking at a lot of potential deals, and we're leaning forward in trying to source additional deals but holding the bar high. The nature of the companies that we're looking at has always been -- are technical in nature, supporting the areas that we've long focused on, be it cybersecurity, most recently, AI, digital and so forth. And I don't see that changing. Our clients are demanding more and more support in those areas. And then rounding out our capital deployment strategy. Of course, it includes share repurchases and dividends.\n So we're looking at all options. We maintain that given the increase in volatility and the strength of our balance sheet, that will tee us up well to meet our capital deployment objectives. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Arnstein from JPMorgan. \nBenjamin Arnstein: I wanted to kind of ask about the election that's coming up in just a couple of days here. I mean, how have you kind of prepared for the outcome of the election and the potential change in administration and leadership in Washington? And maybe how do you kind of think about how you approach the back half of the year if there is a change in leadership for your customers? \nHoracio Rozanski: The -- let me start, and maybe Lloyd will want to add as well. We've been looking -- we look very closely the priorities that both campaigns are talking about, how they're thinking about the future or a country what a new administration or a second term would look like. And of course, there's differences, and those are widely reported and we are aware of those.\n But there's also some issues and that when we talk to our clients are top of mind to them and will not change. The cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure is a great example. Just in the last couple of days, you probably saw the headlines about nation-state attacks on hospital networks in this country as COVID cases and hospitalization surge. 5G, we talked a little bit about before; and the rise of China and the technological competition with China; the importance of AI as a transformative force, both in national defense and in civil society over the coming years; the need to digitally transform our government, both for effectiveness of mission but also for efficiencies. And then that's just the [ wait ] ops. Then you get into the directed energy and space and so many other issues. \n Those issues are here to stay. And Booz Allen has been working for many years now to be a thought leader and a driver of creation of value inside the mission across all those issues and so -- and then some. So that's what we're focused on. We're focused on making sure that we're working with our clients directly on their most important problems, directly on their most resilient and sustained problems, and that we have real value to those. And that's always been our approach to it.\n If -- we'll know more about the election next week, of course. But come what may. We're very focused on serving our clients against our most durable challenges and, like I said, making a real difference for them. \nLloyd Howell: I would just add that given our years of experience, decades, this is not a new dynamic to our business, for a lot of the reasons that Horacio just pointed to, but just the pragmatics of what a transition, should it come to that, looks like. The government doesn't pivot on a dime. And a lot of the programs that we currently support, to Horacio's point, are increasingly tied to their missions, which is politically agnostic.\n In cases where we have seen a party transition with our single P&L, our portfolio where we have a very robust civil federal business, if the agenda were to shift, we have a history of also shifting resources to where the puck is going to be, so to speak.\n So we feel that we've got a very resilient model, years of experience and relationships with our clients to allow us to ride through any transitions that may occur. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. \nJoseph DeNardi: Lloyd, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that 2Q bookings were lower than expected, but the expectation for full year bookings is still intact. So can you just explain that a little bit, like what happened in the quarter that you weren't expecting? And then when should we assume that you guys kind of return to industry-leading book-to-bill in order to support industry-leading organic growth? \nLloyd Howell: Sure. Well, first thing, Joe, as Horacio has always maintained, we're not demand constrained at all. And the timing of bookings is really a consequence of these increased number of large awards that will come and go depending upon a different timing than what we've seen in our historic pattern.\n So in Q1, we had a big couple of wins that bumped up book-to-bill. Those larger procurements didn't come to pass in Q2. But we don't see that -- the problem as much as just a timing issue. So we feel that we've got plenty of demand, strength in the market that's really going to, over time, keep us in the pole position, if you will, in terms of our top line performance. And the challenge is always going to be can we bring on the talent that sort of backs up these larger pursuits and supports our clients. \nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That's helpful. And I think the initial expectation to start the year was that COVID would weigh on margins and that contributed to the initial 10% guidance. Now given where you are, is that largely because COVID has not been impactful? And how should we think about kind of the margin headwind that you all face next year assuming we get back to a more normal environment? Can you continue to grow margins off this higher base? \nLloyd Howell: Sure. I mean, well, we're very pleased with our margins, especially in this sort of unprecedented time. And I think there are a couple of drivers that have gotten us there. Certainly, our top line growth and contract global performance, the fact that in this time, we're seeing very high employee utilization, which is also driving margin, and then the management of unallowables and other discretionary costs that I've talked about are a lot lower.\n We are -- always have maintained that we're interested in top and bottom line growth, and we see margins as a means to that end, not the end. And so we're expecting, over time, and I think there's a national debate now around the virus and its impact, that we will eventually return to something that's a new normal sort of pre-COVID, but the timing of which is hard to really estimate. But for the balance of this fiscal year, our reforecast of low to mid-10s, we feel very confident that we'll be able to finish the year in that range. \nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Horacio Rozanski, President and CEO, for closing remarks. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, everyone, for the conversation this morning. We're entering November, and with it comes not only an election and a holiday season but actually also a meaningful anniversary for our firm. Tuesday, November 17, marks 10 years since our initial public offering, when Booz Allen Hamilton shares opened at $17 a share. I'll never forget going out on the road in December of 2010 with our former CEO and CFO, Ralph Shrader and Sam Strickland, to tell potential investors the story of this company that Ed Booz founded in 1914.\n As I reflected on this recently, 2 things came to mind. The first is just how transformative the last decade has been. Through our Vision 2020 strategy, we carefully positioned ourselves right at the intersection of technology and mission. And over 10 years, this market differentiation significantly expanded our revenues, our profit margins and our earnings, as you saw this morning. In fact, from an investor's perspective, total shareholder returns, adjusted for reinvested dividends, have been in excess of 900% over the decade.\n And the second point I reflected on was how much Booz Allen has not changed since our IPO. The core of this institution, our commitment to clients and to people, our purpose, our values, they carry through history because each generation of leaders is the steward of these fundamentals. These qualities set the standard for success at Booz Allen and are the foundation of our financial strength.\n So as we celebrate this incredible journey, I want to conclude today's call by thanking our analysts and our investors for your insights and support over the last decade. And I'm especially grateful to those of you who've been following us since the IPO. We have learned from each interaction with you, and the past 10 years have made us a better firm.\n And as we said this morning, our work is never done. So with energy and optimism, Booz Allen will strive in the coming decade to continue building on this proud record.\n So thank you again for joining us this morning. Have a great day, and a happy Halloween. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Rubun, and welcome to our team. We're glad to have you on board. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call.\n Lloyd and I are excited to announce Booz Allen's fiscal year 2021 second quarter results this morning. Our firm's performance in this very challenging year has been truly outstanding, and we are proud to discuss the collective accomplishments of the more than 27,000 professionals who work every day in support of our clients, each other and this institution.\n As you saw in our press release this morning, we delivered excellent second quarter results across all metrics. The numbers support our 3-year investment thesis objectives and our growth plan for this fiscal year.\n When our fiscal year opened, only weeks into the disruptions of COVID-19, we recommitted to flawless execution even amid uncertainty, and that's exactly what we have delivered: strong growth at the top and bottom lines, a profit margin that is above historical norms, strong cash generation and continued success in recruiting talent, building our pipeline and capturing opportunities.\n Our growth in the second quarter was fueled by continued strength in our defense and civil businesses. This reflects the value clients place on our offerings and on the talent of our team. Our intelligence business has stabilized in the first half of this fiscal year despite facing unique challenges due to the pandemic. We have a new leader in place and feel confident about future growth. And finally, in global commercial, we expect a modest decline this fiscal year driven by overall economic conditions.\n Looking at the first half of the fiscal year, our financial results show that, to date, Booz Allen has successfully navigated the complexities of COVID-19. We continued to execute against the proven strategy, made operational adjustments as needed and supported our people in new ways so they could focus on clients' critical missions.\n Our unique combination of the right strategy, operating model, people and culture created a first half performance that exceeded even our own expectations. And so today, we are pleased to narrow our guidance range for fiscal year 2021 revenue and raise guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share and operating cash. Lloyd will walk through our performance and updated guidance in more detail in a few minutes.\n First, I'll talk briefly about where our management team is focused, both near and long term. Let's start with the near term.\n Since our fiscal year began, we have talked with you about 3 areas of uncertainty in the second half. First, the course and impacts of COVID-19 in the fall and winter, and especially now, as infections are spiking again across the country; second, the potential for funding disruption after the current continuing resolution expires December 11; and third, the outcome and implications of next week's election. These macro variables are major sources of uncertainty for both our country and our industry. But based on our operating and financial performance in the first half and the strength of our balance sheet, I believe Booz Allen is well positioned to outperform our market despite the potential turbulence in the coming months.\n As I noted last quarter, we believe these dynamics in the macro environment could create opportunities as well. This year, we anticipated and planned for increased volatility in the economy, financial markets and federal budget outlook. This allows us to scan the market from a position of strength, looking for opportunities to build our business, forge strategic partnerships, invest in capabilities, deploy capital and so on. As always, the overriding objective is to maximize value for our firm and our shareholders. With that as a segue, let me shift to the long term.\n Here at Booz Allen, our work is never done. Beyond the excellent operational performance of our team, our business leaders are making great progress on several future-oriented initiatives. For example, we continue to shape our portfolio of business towards high-value work where emerging technologies meet needs at the center of clients' missions. Our strategic review is progressing and we expect to share results with you next summer.\n We continue to develop and deploy our option value initiatives. We are constantly evaluating and strengthening our employee value proposition, including making good progress against the race and social equity agenda we shared with you last quarter. And we are modernizing and investing in our IT and financial infrastructure to support new ways of working, new business lines and additional growth.\n Taken together, these efforts are designed to make our firm even stronger and more successful in the years to come. Staying focused on the future, while at the same time, managing unexpected disruptions and normal ups and downs of business cycles is the job of every leader in this firm.\n Having said that, none of this, none of this would be possible without the entire Booz Allen team. They deserve tremendous credit for our first half performance, our position of strength as we head into what could be a challenging few months and our continued progress on strategic initiatives.\n So before I turn the call over to Lloyd, let me close with a few words directly to my colleagues who are listening. You'll remember, back in April, with our pandemic resilience fund, we made a safe bet. If the firm had your back, you would have the firm's back. You would give Booz Allen and our clients your very best. And in the last 7 months, you've done that and then some. You invented new ways of working practically overnight. You continued to go into critical client facilities with masks and all the right precautions to make sure important missions got done without interruption. You came up with creative ways to connect with each other and build community. You showed courage to both ask for help and to give help to those in need. And you executed all business functions with great precision and skill.\n Truth is what we've faced together in 2020 was simply unthinkable a year ago. As problem solvers, you have risen to the challenge. You have persevered through it all. And that's great. As we knew you to be, you've exceeded our expectations.\n So on behalf of the entire leadership team and in front of our external stakeholders, please accept our gratitude. We are in it together and our firm is better for it. Thank you for all you have done and all you will continue to do.\n And with that, Lloyd, over to you. Great question, and thank you for -- let me set maybe a little bit of context and then go deeper into that question. I couldn't be more pleased with the performance of the business in the first half, especially under the current circumstances. I think it speaks to, certainly, the commitment that our clients have to the mission, to the brains and the heart that our people brought forward. And I think it also speaks to the fact that we have both an operating model and a strategy that works well in good times but really can shine in challenging times. So I think that's what we're beginning to see.\n In that context, over the last 3 years, as Lloyd always points out, it's really been disciplined execution, operational excellence and the ability to drive the business towards this Vision 2020 target of mission technology intersection at the center of what's most important to our clients that has really driven both our growth and our profitability. And I think that's what continues to drive it today.\n I'm excited about the options value portfolio. There's a number of initiatives there. We're making good progress across the portfolio. And I think we'll have more to say about that in the future. I'll tell you, as an anecdote, for example, we were concerned going into the year about Rec.gov because it's a tourism-driven business. It turns out the national parks has been the one area of tourism that has really done well. And so we have, in fact, leapfrogged a little bit of what we expected to see in terms of both growth and profitability in that program.\n But having said that, the option value portfolio still is a very small portion of our business and one where we are optimistic will grow and become more relevant in the coming years. Right now, this is really being driven by the excellent performance of the team. I'll get started. Lloyd might want to jump in as well. Carter, on your first question, I'll say, nothing is business as usual at this point. Everything has had to be reinvented and retooled to match the current environment. We saw some decreases in attrition as a result of the environment. Obviously pleased with those. And it's a challenging labor market. It continues to be. I know some sectors of the economy don't look this way, but the talent that we look for, especially the technology talent, is still in very high demand.\n And I'm pleased with the performance through the first 6 months. I think we've hired a lot of great people, again, a lot of the right people to help us grow our business. And I think the future looks bright as it relates to the talent pool that we are looking for. I think what we've done, frankly, over the last 6 months, if anything, has strengthened our brand in the talent markets, and I think that will pay dividends not just now but in the out years.\n What was your -- sorry, global commercial. So we expected going into this year to be challenging for our global commercial business, both in our international, which is mostly Middle East footprint, and our U.S. domestic footprint. I think we -- what happened in the international business, in some ways, has been a little more dire than we expected, especially given the disruptions in Beirut where a lot of our talent resides. And that's a business that is in transition for us.\n But having said that, the results in the U.S., which is largely a cyber business, have been potentially better than we expected. So when you put it all together, I think that, that business is balancing itself in the right direction. It's still only about 3% of our total revenue base, but it plays an important strategic role and important branding role to the overall portfolio. And as we've always said, the margins are also strong. Matt, just to be sure, you're asking about 5G? Okay. Great. Absolutely, you are breaking up a little bit. I think Lloyd is feeling a little lonely here in the Q&A section, but I'll get started. I'll get us started. I think the answer is absolutely. I think 5G is emerging as an important set of technology. It's really a family of technologies. It's not one thing. It's not just millimeter wave. And that family of technologies is of increased importance, not just in the commercial market but across the government, including DoD. There are cyber implications of 5G. There's operational implications of 5G. There's the ability to move both processing and information to the edge in a way that it would advantage many missions.\n And I am proud of the fact that, much like everything else in our innovation agenda, we saw this relatively early. We began to position for it, and we have some really interesting work going on across the government that, in my mind, begins to define us as a thought leader in this area, much like we are a thought leader in AI. And by the way, these 2 technologies ultimately do travel together.\n So more to think about that, more to say about that. If you ask me, is that a big part of the portfolio? They're not. We're not scaling there like we have scaled in AI already. But I think the future is bright, and I think we're well positioned. That's a really good question, and I think the answer is yes. We've narrowed to 7% to 9%. We're proud of the fact that we're going to have a strong growth year in the middle of a pandemic and with very strong profitability.\n But I think that sort of the broader answer to the question is we still see very strong demand signals for the type of work that we're doing, for the type of capability that we bring to our clients. We are being choosy, if you will, in terms of both the work that we choose to pursue and the people that we're hiring to make sure that they are consistent with this intersection of core mission issues and next-generation technology because we believe that it's both the most promising and the most resilient part of the market as the market experiences some turbulence.\n And so the numbers that we're putting out are not the very most we could possibly grow if we were more sort of -- if we were less discriminate about the work that we're doing, these are the numbers that give us both excellent financial performance in the near term but we believe sustainability into the medium and long term. I think the short form of the answer is yes with the following color to it. There's -- we've been talking for quite some time about the fact that the digital assets, whether it's data or software, are becoming a bigger part of the value that is created in -- for our clients. And so the -- we're -- and we've been part of this digital transformation that is sweeping through the federal government. And the government and DoD, in particular, are trying to think hard about how to procure these types of capabilities and these types of assets in a way that they can do it faster, more reliably, more repeatably because this moves at digital speed.\n And I think Booz Allen is, honestly, maybe a little modestly, doing a great job across the board, not just in terms of coming up with our own proprietary solutions but of partnering with other technology firms to make sure that their proprietary solutions can actually add mission value. It's this intersection of mission and technology. Where we excel is the ability to take not just one piece of software or one technology but a portfolio to solve a meaningful mission problem, whether it is a cyber defense of critical infrastructure, whether it is using AI to improve customer service or to improve intelligence production. It's never really one thing, it's a combination of a number of things.\n And inside that combination, technology such as Modzy can play both an important role in advancing the mission but also give us an additional layer of differentiation. So that's how we look at it. It's in the overall context as opposed to -- we have this one piece of software or this one unique capability. Cai, if I can jump in. I would connect actually your 2 questions in the following way. It's -- the strength of the first half and the way in which we've managed the business with focus and with discipline actually allows us to do 2 things in the second half. One, we're happy to raise ADEPS guidance, of course. But two, it also frees up resources for us to recruit more aggressively, to invest in key capabilities more aggressive and to position us for future growth, even more aggressively than we would have otherwise. I guess I'll start. We were -- nested in our civil business primarily is an outstanding health business that is really a leader in this industry, especially in helping our clients drive their digital transformation, which is, of course, a major issue affecting health care. It also has a tremendous level of actual health expertise on the science side, on the epidemiology side, on the care delivery side and then the insurance payment and so forth. And so it's been called to help already as COVID has redrawn the health environment around the nation, and it will continue to do so. So we see continued growth and opportunity in our health portfolio, certainly, over the many coming years as this is a national priority, together with the other national priorities we support.\n And I think -- I can't remember what the second question was. I think that was for you. The -- let me start, and maybe Lloyd will want to add as well. We've been looking -- we look very closely the priorities that both campaigns are talking about, how they're thinking about the future or a country what a new administration or a second term would look like. And of course, there's differences, and those are widely reported and we are aware of those.\n But there's also some issues and that when we talk to our clients are top of mind to them and will not change. The cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure is a great example. Just in the last couple of days, you probably saw the headlines about nation-state attacks on hospital networks in this country as COVID cases and hospitalization surge. 5G, we talked a little bit about before; and the rise of China and the technological competition with China; the importance of AI as a transformative force, both in national defense and in civil society over the coming years; the need to digitally transform our government, both for effectiveness of mission but also for efficiencies. And then that's just the [ wait ] ops. Then you get into the directed energy and space and so many other issues. \n Those issues are here to stay. And Booz Allen has been working for many years now to be a thought leader and a driver of creation of value inside the mission across all those issues and so -- and then some. So that's what we're focused on. We're focused on making sure that we're working with our clients directly on their most important problems, directly on their most resilient and sustained problems, and that we have real value to those. And that's always been our approach to it.\n If -- we'll know more about the election next week, of course. But come what may. We're very focused on serving our clients against our most durable challenges and, like I said, making a real difference for them. Thank you, everyone, for the conversation this morning. We're entering November, and with it comes not only an election and a holiday season but actually also a meaningful anniversary for our firm. Tuesday, November 17, marks 10 years since our initial public offering, when Booz Allen Hamilton shares opened at $17 a share. I'll never forget going out on the road in December of 2010 with our former CEO and CFO, Ralph Shrader and Sam Strickland, to tell potential investors the story of this company that Ed Booz founded in 1914.\n As I reflected on this recently, 2 things came to mind. The first is just how transformative the last decade has been. Through our Vision 2020 strategy, we carefully positioned ourselves right at the intersection of technology and mission. And over 10 years, this market differentiation significantly expanded our revenues, our profit margins and our earnings, as you saw this morning. In fact, from an investor's perspective, total shareholder returns, adjusted for reinvested dividends, have been in excess of 900% over the decade.\n And the second point I reflected on was how much Booz Allen has not changed since our IPO. The core of this institution, our commitment to clients and to people, our purpose, our values, they carry through history because each generation of leaders is the steward of these fundamentals. These qualities set the standard for success at Booz Allen and are the foundation of our financial strength.\n So as we celebrate this incredible journey, I want to conclude today's call by thanking our analysts and our investors for your insights and support over the last decade. And I'm especially grateful to those of you who've been following us since the IPO. We have learned from each interaction with you, and the past 10 years have made us a better firm.\n And as we said this morning, our work is never done. So with energy and optimism, Booz Allen will strive in the coming decade to continue building on this proud record.\n So thank you again for joining us this morning. Have a great day, and a happy Halloween."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing your thanks to our colleagues. This firm has truly rallied to meet the challenges of 2020. It shows in the financial results we're announcing this morning and in many other ways that numbers can't easily capture. We are now halfway through our fiscal year, an extraordinary 6-month period for the country as well as our company. In these challenging times, our clients have continued to rely on Booz Allen's leadership and capabilities in support of their missions. I am enormously proud of our performance.\n Our outstanding second quarter results maintain and build on our first quarter performance, showcasing our reliability and execution. Consistent with our position as the industry leader, we continue to see robust organic growth, with headcount expanding and total backlog reaching a new record high. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and this gives us great confidence that our firm can manage any potential challenges in the next few months. Thanks to our prudent financial management, we also have the ability to take advantage of opportunities as they emerge, whether in the debt, equity or M&A markets.\n I'll now run through our second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 11% and 10.6%, respectively, compared to the same quarter last year. The primary driver of our growth was ongoing demand for our services. We benefited from staff utilization above historic norms that was driven by fewer PTO days taken by our employees.\n Turning to headcount. We ended the quarter with 27,638 employees, up 654 or 2.4% year-over-year and up 257 since the end of June. In a challenging labor market, we are pleased with our performance to date.\n On Slide 7, you'll see that total backlog increased 7% to $24.6 billion. Funded backlog was up 2% to $4.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 15% to $6.2 billion, and priced options rose 6% to $13.9 billion.\n Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.8x, and our last 12 months book-to-bill was 1.2x. The quarterly number is lower than our recent second quarters and, frankly, slightly lower than our expectations. That said, we expect continued volatility with our quarterly book-to-bill pattern as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids.\n First half book-to-bill was 2.0x, in line with our historical norm. Our bookings expectation for the full fiscal year remains unchanged with a number of large award opportunities in our second half pipeline.\n Year-to-date, COVID-19 has not slowed the award environment. While credit is due to the diligence of our team at Booz Allen, we must also acknowledge the efforts of our clients and contracting officers, many of whom continue to work remotely through the busy government year-end procurement season.\n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $228 million, up 19% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.3%, our highest quarterly result since 2015. These increases in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin were driven by top line growth, strong contract level performance, ongoing cost management efforts and reductions in certain types of expenses like travel and meetings. These were partially offset by our inability to bill for fee on shift work performed in our defense and intelligence markets.\n In the quarter, the negative fee impact was approximately $7 million. Going forward, we expect unbilled fee to have a negligible impact to earnings as the majority of affected staff have returned to client site offices or are expected to do so shortly.\n Second quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 19% and 25% year-over-year to $136 million and $143 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 23% to $0.98, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.03. These increases were primarily due to revenue growth and adjusted EBITDA margin improvement, with support from lower interest expenses and reduced share count due to our share repurchase program.\n Transitioning to cash. We generated $426 million in operating cash during the second quarter, an increase of 97% over the prior year. This represents the strongest quarterly operating cash result since our IPO. Cash ended the quarter at $1.3 billion.\n Operating cash flow performance was primarily due to the overall growth of the business, working capital management and lower cash taxes due to the carryover of R&D credits we claimed at the end of last year. Lower cash disbursements also contributed to the second quarter performance driven by cost management and lower expenses attributable to COVID.\n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $18 million. This year, we continue to prioritize technology and tools that enable a virtual work environment. Also, we are nearing implementation of our next-generation financial system, which will support the company's growth into the future. Please turn to Slide 8.\n During the quarter, we repurchased $30 million worth of shares at an average price of $76 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $73 million to shareholders. We are exiting the second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash on the balance sheet. We continue to view our balance sheet as a strategic asset, especially in times of volatility. We are committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through patient, disciplined capital allocation. We see ourselves as well placed to quickly capitalize upon opportunities as they may arise over the coming months.\n In our investment thesis, we set a 70% to 80% ADEPS growth target over a 3-year period ending this fiscal year, supported by $1.4 billion in capital deployment. We are well positioned to meet our ADEPS goal organically as reflected in our updated fiscal year guidance. As a result, while deploying the remainder of our capital target remains our objective, we will remain patient and disciplined toward our deployment strategy to meet this objective.\n Today, we are announcing that the company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 16. On August 24, we issued $700 million in senior notes that are due in 2028. We used the proceeds to pay down our $350 million in senior notes due in 2025 and to strengthen our balance sheet while meaningfully reducing the interest rate.\n Before opening the line for questions, I'll briefly touch on our view of the rest of the year and our guidance. Please move to Slide 9.\n We are very pleased to be raising our expectations for the fiscal year, even with ongoing uncertainties related to COVID-19, the federal budget and next week's election. This improved outlook is the product of several things: our excellent first half performance, the fundamental strength of our institution and our confidence in the skill and agility of our leaders and teams. Throughout the rest of the fiscal year, we'll make operational adjustments as needed and stand ready to jump on opportunities that emerge. Let me run through the numbers.\n For the full fiscal year, we are tightening our revenue range and expect growth between 7% and 9%. We now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be in the low to mid-10% range. We have raised and narrowed the range for adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $3.60 and $3.75. The ADEPS guidance is based on 136 million to 140 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%.\n On operating cash, we are forecasting between $600 million and $650 million for the full year. And finally, our outlook for capital expenditures is unchanged at $80 million to $100 million.\n As we look into our fiscal year second half and prepare for an eventual return to normalcy, we will spend a portion of the funding that we previously set aside for weathering the pandemic. We expect to hire aggressively to sustain our growth and plan to reward our talent for their impressive execution to date. We will also implement our new financial system that further supports our business leaders. In short, we will continue to invest in our people and our long-term growth initiatives.\n Our updated guidance reflects the traditional seasonality of some of our expenses and anticipated return to more typical patterns of labor utilization, ongoing strategic investments, and the aforementioned uncertainty around COVID, the elections and the overall budget and funding environment. The next few months will be difficult to navigate. However, as our new guidance indicates, we remain confident in our ability to adapt, execute and win regardless of the environment.\n In closing, we are extremely proud of our second quarter results. Despite the challenges we all now face daily, our people have responded with energy and dedication. As we head into the second half, the entire management team is excited about our continued success and focused on maintaining our industry leadership for the remainder of the year and beyond.\n With that, Rubun, let's open the lines for questions. I'll jump in here. We see priced options as a leading indicator in a couple of different ways: one, our clients' confidence regarding what they'd like to do or tasks they'd like to turn on; and then secondly, their satisfaction with Booz Allen and our delivery up to that point.\n The timing of them is really dictated by the contract -- the underlying contract. So there's some variability depending upon the period of performance. But by and large, if you look at the unfunded and priced options portions of our backlog, they tend to convert anywhere between 60% and 70%, funded obviously at or near 100%.\n And so as Horacio has always said, we don't feel demand constrained at all. In fact, this quarter indicates with an increase to $24.6 billion, we've got the work. It then turns to can we attract, onboard and deploy the talent to convert that backlog. Yes. Well, thank you, Cai. First, let me say, we're very pleased with our ability to source and attract the talent that we have, and particularly given the unique circumstances that I think we're all facing into. From an arithmetic standpoint, even at 2.4%, with a combination of increased salary, a broader base of staff that's available and, frankly, utilization rates that are unprecedented, the conversion of that certainly places us in our forecasted range of 7% to 9%.\n Our work is never done. We know that we're going to have to remain as aggressive and diligent in finding this technical staff. We're working closely with our business leaders, our recruiting engine to increase the yield. But given how we forecasted the rest of the remainder of the year, we're confident that we'll be able to bring on the right talent. Yes. It's a great question, awkward one to answer without sounding callous regarding the impact that it's had on our workforce and people. But the bottom line financially is that our people are not taking PTO as they were pre-COVID. That translates into higher utilization. As you mentioned in your question, there are savings on travel, conferences, meals, other discretionary expenses. And ultimately, we're seeing a reduction in overhead expenses.\n We feel we're well positioned from a P&L perspective for the balance of the year. Certainly, as we weigh into the uncertainties that Horacio and I have talked about, our resilient program that we stood up at the beginning of the year, we still have a significant portion that remains to ride through the next spike if it comes to that. And we've learned a lot in terms of the current environment regarding telework, as you've heard in my prepared remarks around CapEx, our investment in our infrastructure. So we see a strong P&L, which will give us the strength and the resiliency as we navigate the next few months. Sure. Thank you. I'm going to keep my comments to this fiscal year, but let me say that I couldn't be pleased with our ability to generate cash. It really has been helped by onetime events, but also our core cash growth and effective working capital has really been the underlying story.\n What we see now is that elections were very high. We saw less in cash taxes that were paid, flat payables and then reduction in disbursements, be it PTO, medical, travel and corporate salaries. We expect in the second half for that to normalize a bit. So when you look at what we are forecasting in terms of operating cash for the year, that's how we get to the $600 million to $650 million.\n I believe that with the improvements that we've made over the past couple of years, that they truly are now institutionalized. We're always never satisfied, so we'll be looking for ways to continue to improve on that. But I think it tees us up well for the future. Are you referring to our inability to invoice for fee tied to the CARES Act? Oh, yes. So we originally forecasted -- I think it was $5 million to $7 million per month. And we saw in Q1 that it was more like $4 million per month. And in Q2, it dropped off even more. And that's really a function of folks returning to support their clients in their space as well as our space originally in a shift to work arrangement.\n And so as we said in our prepared remarks, we don't see that being significant going forward. We're in close discussions with our clients and contracting officers to make sure we're both seeing it the same way, but all credit due to our clients and our people to manage that. Horacio, I'll take the capital deployment. Jon, we continue to deploy capital, as we say, in a patient and disciplined manner, both in the short, near and long term. And with the balance sheet that we view as a strategic asset, it really tees us up well.\n Our priorities around capital deployment haven't changed regarding M&A. As we've always said, we've got a traditional focus on capability tuck-ins. In today's environment, we're looking at a lot of potential deals, and we're leaning forward in trying to source additional deals but holding the bar high. The nature of the companies that we're looking at has always been -- are technical in nature, supporting the areas that we've long focused on, be it cybersecurity, most recently, AI, digital and so forth. And I don't see that changing. Our clients are demanding more and more support in those areas. And then rounding out our capital deployment strategy. Of course, it includes share repurchases and dividends.\n So we're looking at all options. We maintain that given the increase in volatility and the strength of our balance sheet, that will tee us up well to meet our capital deployment objectives. I would just add that given our years of experience, decades, this is not a new dynamic to our business, for a lot of the reasons that Horacio just pointed to, but just the pragmatics of what a transition, should it come to that, looks like. The government doesn't pivot on a dime. And a lot of the programs that we currently support, to Horacio's point, are increasingly tied to their missions, which is politically agnostic.\n In cases where we have seen a party transition with our single P&L, our portfolio where we have a very robust civil federal business, if the agenda were to shift, we have a history of also shifting resources to where the puck is going to be, so to speak.\n So we feel that we've got a very resilient model, years of experience and relationships with our clients to allow us to ride through any transitions that may occur. Sure. Well, first thing, Joe, as Horacio has always maintained, we're not demand constrained at all. And the timing of bookings is really a consequence of these increased number of large awards that will come and go depending upon a different timing than what we've seen in our historic pattern.\n So in Q1, we had a big couple of wins that bumped up book-to-bill. Those larger procurements didn't come to pass in Q2. But we don't see that -- the problem as much as just a timing issue. So we feel that we've got plenty of demand, strength in the market that's really going to, over time, keep us in the pole position, if you will, in terms of our top line performance. And the challenge is always going to be can we bring on the talent that sort of backs up these larger pursuits and supports our clients. Sure. I mean, well, we're very pleased with our margins, especially in this sort of unprecedented time. And I think there are a couple of drivers that have gotten us there. Certainly, our top line growth and contract global performance, the fact that in this time, we're seeing very high employee utilization, which is also driving margin, and then the management of unallowables and other discretionary costs that I've talked about are a lot lower.\n We are -- always have maintained that we're interested in top and bottom line growth, and we see margins as a means to that end, not the end. And so we're expecting, over time, and I think there's a national debate now around the virus and its impact, that we will eventually return to something that's a new normal sort of pre-COVID, but the timing of which is hard to really estimate. But for the balance of this fiscal year, our reforecast of low to mid-10s, we feel very confident that we'll be able to finish the year in that range."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instruction] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Will Yates [ph]. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nWill Yates: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen\u2019s first quarter 2021 earnings announcement. We hope you have had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. I am Will Yates, Interim Head of Investor Relations. And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that maybe considered forward-looking and therefore are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company\u2019s services and other factors discussed in today\u2019s earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer, included in our first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call. During today\u2019s call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter fiscal year 2021 slides. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 5.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Will and welcome to the earnings calls. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would like to start this morning in a somewhat unconventional way, but one that is very much in keeping with our culture at Booz Allen. At the start of every leadership meeting, we usually take a moment to focus on an aspect of our purpose and values. And today, we would like to do the same here. Booz Allen\u2019s purpose is to empower people to change the world, to empower people to change the world. And to us, it\u2019s not a guideline it\u2019s a statement that guides our thinking and our actions. In recent weeks, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there has been a reckoning in our country about deep seated racial inequity and a long overdue acknowledgement of the pain felt in the Black community. Inside our firm, we have encouraged open, direct and at times, very difficult conversations about racism and injustice. Thousands of us have participated in the virtual hands, many more joint team meetings and listening sessions and communicated with us through e-mails and one-on-one discussions with me and other senior leaders. Our colleagues have offered deeply personal stories, ideas, feedback, calls for action and a real passion for change. At a personal level, I have learned and I have grown through each interaction. I am deeply grateful for the honesty and the trust that people have extended to me. And as the leader of this firm, I am committed to doing more, because when at Booz Allen, we say that black lives matter, we are not making a political statement, we are making a statement about our values. In early June, our firm committed publicly to taking action along six dimensions. Our ways and social equity agenda has both internal and external elements. The six points are as follows. Number one, we will undertake an independent assessment of our business practices affected people of color. Second, we will intensify our efforts and accountability to increase representation of people of color at all levels. Third, we have already increased personal time and space as well as resources for our employees\u2019 mental health. Fourth, we are accelerating diversity and inclusion learning opportunities for all employees. Fifth, we are making race and social justice, a major element of our corporate philanthropy. And sixth, Booz Allen has a unique voice and unique capabilities. And combined with our talents, we will use them to advance social justice through work with our community partners. What we heard from our people, what I heard from our people is that they want Booz Allen to be a sustained catalyst for change. And with that in mind, we have crafted a comprehensive agenda that will endure and we\u2019ve all got to learn. It\u2019s not just the right thing to do and not just of this moment. Our purpose and values demand that we take action today and into the future. Lloyd, you have been a leader in this effort, offering guidance and insights that have been crucial to shaping our agenda. I know you want to add your voice to this conversation. So let me turn the floor over to you.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio. The past few months have been challenging for our country and our firm. July 18th marked 32 years since the day I joined Booz Allen. When I say this firm is my family, I mean it. And just like with all families, sometimes difficult conversations are needed. This is one of those times. I am proud to be part of one of the most diverse leadership teams in Corporate America today. Our Board of Directors is also much more diverse than most. This is clearly a firm that cares about people and about diversity and inclusion. But it is also clear that we have work to do inside Booz Allen and throughout society. Our race and social equity agenda acknowledges that. It says that to be a force for change in the world we must start by ensuring that every person at our firm feels empowered that those who have been more marginalized in the past know they have a voice, a seat at the table and an opportunity to thrive. I have experienced this firm as a place of opportunity and I believe that it can be a force for good in the world. That\u2019s what we are doing here all those years ago, called me back after a short stint on Wall Street and that\u2019s kept me at our firm since. Furthermore, this is an issue all of our stakeholders care about, from employees and clients, through strategic partners and investors. I look forward to the progress we can make together and to continuing the journey with you, Horacio, and the rest of my colleagues.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Lloyd. I couldn\u2019t agree more and thanks again for your leadership. Lloyd and I felt strongly that we needed to begin our earnings call on this topic, because the outstanding performance that we discuss with you, our analysts and our investors year after year rests on the foundation of our people, our purpose and our passion. Let\u2019s turn now to set business performance. As you saw in the press release, we have another excellent first quarter. The business is operating well and we continue to support our clients, invest in our people, and manage through the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite all the things that are different and more challenging than in a typical year, our team has delivered another strong start. Our people continue to demonstrate their value to clients, missions and this institution in these truly unprecedented times. It is my highest priority shared by every member of the board and the leadership team to make them feel supported and to endeavor to keep them safe, as they do their critical work. Three months into the fiscal year, our financial results aligned with our expectations for the full year. Across all the key metrics, we are pleased with our performance. You will recall from our May earnings call that we forecast a strong first half and a more uncertain second half. At this point, the unknowns in the back half of the year remain. First, we do not know how the pandemic will progress or affect our people, clients and business over the full fiscal year. Second, it is still too early to tell how the federal appropriations process will play out this fall. And third, it is unclear what budget related impact November\u2019s election may have. Despite these unknowns, we are affirming our guidance for the fiscal year and we are looking for opportunities to use our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset. Turning now to the pandemic and Booz Allen\u2019s response. As we have said before, we see it evolving in three phases. The first phase, emergency response was from late January through April. Now and for most of this fiscal year, we expect to be in Phase 2, the period when the virus is still circulating and there is no proven treatment or vaccine. We continue to emphasize telework with more than 80% of our billable work being done remotely. And we have collaborated closely with clients to put hundreds of safe return plans in place for those whose work requires them to be at a facility. Also, we are pleased that a significant portion of the $100 million will set aside the response to the pandemic remain available. Throughout the year, we will continue supporting our people and investing in health and safety programs. During the first quarter, our leaders executed the business well, recruiting and hiring talent, managing contracts, winning new opportunities, developing our capabilities and making progress on our option value portfolio. Our defense and civil markets, representing three quarters of our business continue to deliver robust growth. The intelligence market has been more affected by the pandemic, but it\u2019s showing positive signs in terms of our recruiting and opportunity pipeline. And in global commercial, we continue to see strength in our cyber oriented work. Across all markets, we are positioned at the intersection of mission and technology, where demand is robust. Our book-to-bill ratio was a first quarter record and we are especially excited about the content and quality of the work. Significant awards across the portfolio show that we have invested in the right capabilities to support our government as it scales new technologies into mission. For example, under a nearly $1 billion recompete win, we will help the Army expand use of virtual reality and artificial intelligence tools in critical learning. The program called Emergent Threat, Training, and Readiness Capability, or ET2RC is delivered on basis worldwide. We are extremely proud of this work, because it helps protect for well deployed soldiers from emerging threats. A second example is our work at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, where we are helping to source and integrate the best AI technologies into priority DoD missions. The contract announced in May is about operationalizing AI at scale and represents our biggest most strategic win to-date, spanning a portfolio of about 70 AI projects across multiple federal agencies. And finally, I will mention a significant digital transformation win at the IRS. Under a contract called Enterprise Case Management Solution Integrator Services, we are building an enterprise-wide case management platform that will help modernize IRS systems, reduce costs, improve efficiency and vastly improve service to taxpayers. These programs and many other opportunities in our pipelines will continue to show Booz Allen as the premier provider of mission-critical technologies to federal agencies. Even as we continue to execute our business exceptionally well, our leadership team is positioned for the future. We intend to take all that we have learned through Vision 2020 and throughout this pandemic and apply going forward. Through our innovation agenda, we continue to develop core and option value technologies that we know clients need to advance their mission. We are strengthening our IT infrastructure, including modernization of our financial systems. These technology investments support telework, create efficiencies, enable growth and prepare us for emerging business needs. We are also preparing for increased volatility in the economy, financial markets and budget outlook. We have spoken about those in terms of challenges, but they also present opportunities. We are actively scanning and plan to be aggressive in deploying capital at the right time to maximize value for our firm and our shareholders. In sum, from a position of strength, we are laying the groundwork for continued growth and market leadership. This approach has been the key to our institution success for more than a century. We believe it is also the core of our value proposition to investors today. And with that, Lloyd, over to you for more in depth look at our first quarter results.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio. I am tremendously proud not only of our performance in the first quarter, but also of the dedication and determination exhibited by our people. Their commitment to our firm, their colleagues and our clients\u2019 mission is unwavering. They have risen to the challenge of operating in an unprecedented environment and our very strong start to fiscal year 2021 gives us confidence that we can meet our goals for the full year. We are now in the final year of our 3-year investment thesis and remain committed to maximizing shareholder value in both the near and long-term. Our first quarter results maintained our consistent record of strong financial performance. Additionally, we continued to grow our headcount and had a record first quarter book-to-bill positioning us well for the full year. We continue to invest in our people, capabilities and technology, preparing Booz Allen for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. And we have the balance sheet strength to take advantage of potential future market volatility, while augmenting our operating performance with opportunistic capital deployment. I will now cover our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses, increased 7.2% and 10.5% respectively compared to the same quarter last year. Growth continues to be fueled by strong demand for our services and solutions, particularly in our defense and civil businesses and an increase in headcount to meet that demand. It also reflects our success first in transitioning most of our work to remote delivery and now where required and a portion of it back on to Booz Allen or client site. Revenue growth this quarter was impacted by lower than typical billable expenses, primarily due to COVID-19. We anticipate continued volatility in billable expenses, because the timing and magnitude of things like travel, equipment purchases, subcontractors and other direct costs remain uncertain. However, as we have said in the past, revenue, excluding billable expenses, is where we generate most of our profit, and therefore is the metric we focus on internally. Turning to Slide 7, our book-to-bill was 2.2x a first quarter record. Our trailing 12-month figure is now 1.4x revenue. We continue to augment our traditional foundation of diversified small awards by pursuing larger and more complex that by their nature caused quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill. As a case in point, during our first quarter, we booked several large awards, including those who Horacio mentioned, which helped increase total backlog by 16% to a record high $23 billion. Funded backlog was up 8% to $3.4 billion, unfunded backlog grew 9% to $4.7 billion, and price options rose 21% to $14.8 billion. Today, COVID-19 has not slowed down the award environment. This is a credit to our clients and contracting officers as they continue to issue requests for proposals and awards in a remote work setting. Pivoting to headcount, as of June 30, we had 27,381 employees, up 997 year-over-year or 3.8%. For the quarter, we added 208 employees. We have adapted well to remote hiring and our headcount continues to be buoyed by lower than typical attrition, which we attribute in part to the pandemic resilience program we put in place on April 1. For the year, we remain in a growth posture and intend to increase headcount to meet sustained demand. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $213 million, up 7% year-over-year. On our last call, we estimated that our inability to build for fee on shift work performed in our defense and intelligence markets would create a negative impact of approximately $6 million per month. The actual impact for the first quarter was about $12 million. After accounting for this impact, our increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by top line growth, strong contract level performance and effective cost management. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% the same as the first quarter last year. Two factors were at play. Lower than expected billable expenses improve adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue, but this was more than offset by unbilled fee in our defense and intelligence markets. The impact to earnings and margin going forward will depend mainly on the pace at which this work continues to fully transition back on site and whether any modifications are made to the CARES Act due to expire after September 30. As noted previously, the potential that this fee will not be recovered is reflected in our guidance range. First quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 10% year-over-year to $129.3 million and $129.9 million respectively. Diluted earnings per share rose 11% to $0.92, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.93. These increases were primarily due to our revenue growth, decreased interest expense, a lower tax rate and reduced share count due to our share repurchase program. Turning to cash, we generated $140 million in operating cash during the first quarter, an increase of 175% over the prior year. Cash ended the quarter at $621 million. This strength in cash flow was primarily due to our effective working capital management and lower interest expense. COVID-19 has not materially impacted cash collections as the virtual invoicing process continues to run smoothly. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $20 million. This reflects a shift away from facilities investments towards technology and tools needed to support the virtual work environment. Additionally, we continue to modernize our corporate IT infrastructure. As Horacio mentioned, we are approaching the implementation of a next-generation financial system capable of supporting us through a period of dynamic future growth. Please turn to Slide 8. Our robust operating performance and prudent capital management have resulted in a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet. During the first quarter, we continued to execute a disciplined, value-enhancing capital allocation strategy. In the quarter, we repurchased $76 million worth of shares at an average price of $72 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $119 million to shareholders during the quarter. We continue to see the strength of our balance sheet as a source of strategic advantage, particularly as we enter a period of potential uncertainty for our industry and for the broader economy. In times of volatility, well-capitalized firms such as ours can create incremental value through opportunistic acquisitions or timely return of capital to shareholders. In our investment thesis, we set a $1.4 billion deployment target over the 3-year period ending this fiscal year. This remains our objective. And while we anticipate being more aggressive and deploying capital towards attractive opportunities, we will not artificially bias our deployment strategy to meet this objective. We will remain disciplined as we maximize opportunities for our firm and our shareholders. Lastly, today, we are announcing that the company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share payable on August 28 to stockholders of record on August 14. Before opening the line for questions, I will briefly touch on our view of the rest of the year and our guidance. Please move to Slide 9. With one quarter behind us, our guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue growth between 6% and 10%, adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 10% and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $3.40 and $3.60. The ADEPS guidance is based on $136 million to $140 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. We are forecasting operating cash to be between $550 million and $600 million and capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $100 million. As expected, we have an excellent start to the year and our strong first quarter sets us up well for the second half. The uncertainties we faced are industry-wide concerns. We expect to manage through any turbulence well as we have in the past and we will be looking for strategic opportunities to un-harness the significant potential of our balance sheet. In closing, we are extremely proud of our first quarter and continue to work towards realizing the 3-year goals captured in our investment thesis. Our firm looks forward to maintaining its record as an industry leader this year and beyond. With that, Will, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.\nWill Yates: Thank you, Lloyd. Operator, please open the lines?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] I show our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, good morning, everyone and thank you. Horacio or Lloyd, I know it\u2019s only been 2 months since your last earnings call, but I just wanted to touch upon how you are seeing the government reacts at COVID in this Phase 2, which seems as you had mentioned will go on for some time, whether it\u2019s their thought process on the demand environment and how that\u2019s changing or how to operate in a more virtual environment and the opportunities for you of course?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sheila, good morning. It\u2019s Horacio. Why don\u2019t I start and I am sure Lloyd will want to add. Let me first acknowledge the hardships that the pandemic is causing on people, on our clients really in the entire country. I have been in discussions with several senior clients and I have been impressed by how thoughtful and how focused they are. They are thinking about the total force meaning their people and our people together and we are working in partnership through the safe return process. Our goals as you know are to protect the health and safety of our people, to serve our clients and to maintain our financial strength and resilience and thanks to all of these combined efforts by the government and by Booz Allen. We are operating at pre-pandemic levels, essentially. You look at the demand environment it continues to be very strong. You saw it in our book-to-bill. We have a very healthy pipeline. Our clients \u2013 we don\u2019t see in some pockets things might be moving to the right a little bit, but by and large, the demand environment continues to be very strong and clients are if anything any even more focused when bringing technology to bear, to tackle these issues, they have moved to telework, just like we have and we are talking about remote delivery for the long runs. And this has also unearthed some needs in their networks, in their systems for cybersecurity, for cloud, for a number of things. So, all-in-all, I think we are going to continue to see this kind of focus and this kind of moving going forward.\nLloyd Howell: Good morning, Sheila. I would just add a couple of more points. On the demand side, we have seen about $20 million in new contract awards and mods to existing contracts that are COVID-related. We have got about $30 million in COVID-related opportunities that we are pursuing. As you heard in our prepared remarks on the recruiting front, albeit the volume lower than we had hoped going into the pandemic, we are winning. We are winning the war in talent. We are able to source, recruit and onboard and deploy our people and I think we are getting better and better at that. The payment offices are operating well. They are paying on invoices. So, I think the government has responded well through the pandemic and we have kept pace with them.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. Thank you for that color. And then maybe as a follow-up just on your last point, as well as you guys mentioned in the opening remarks, it\u2019s very clear you care about your people. And just thinking about hiring and consulting headcount grew 4% in a very tough virtual environment, but that\u2019s actually in line with your 2-year average. So, pretty good all things considered. Just wanted to see what you are seeing in terms of hiring and attrition?\nLloyd Howell: I will start \u2013 on the hiring front. I think everyone, the labor market as well as ourselves had to adjust though we had done a modest amount pre-pandemic, it really went full bore in the midst of it. And I would say that candidates have acclimated well as is our hiring managers and our recruiting team. If there is any challenges we value our culture so much, so now that we have added 4% to our workforce, we have colleagues now that haven\u2019t physically touched other colleagues. So, we are working through how to have virtual, social hours, things of that sort to maintain that, but I\u2019d say the machinery is working well and we remain optimistic of keeping pace throughout the year.\nHoracio Rozanski: The only thing I will add to that is just to say that all the work that we have done both on our social justice agenda and before that on pandemic response, I think as if anything strengthen, our value proposition both inside Booz Allen and our brand as an employer. So, we have reason to believe that we will continue to see the level of success going forward.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Raviv from Citi. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: It\u2019s [indiscernible] calling on for Jon. It\u2019s been a lot of time in your prepared remarks, talking about balance sheet and the ability to take advantage of market volatility. Can you just shed a little bit more color on where you are standing, what sort of capabilities, look to add and then also a little bit of color on sort of size that you preserve for them, this is what you are looking at?\nHoracio Rozanski: Why don\u2019t I start and I am sure again Lloyd will want to add. As you pointed out, we are looking at opportunities in the market very assertively. Our balance sheet is very strong. Our strategy is now clearly any focus. And so we know what we are looking for. It\u2019s mostly tuck-ins that allow us to bring in unique technologies and unique positions to clients that accelerate our growth. The pipeline is beginning to build nicely after some fits and starts at the beginning of the pandemic. And we intend to scan things assertively. We are not going to deviate from the level of discipline we normally bring, but we are prepared to take advantage of volatility in asset prices and ensure that we are capturing what we need.\nLloyd Howell: Jon, not much more to add, we are, as Horacio said, continuing to look at options to maximize value for our shareholders in the near, mid and long-term and certainly capability tuck-ins are a part of that. So, we look at over 100 opportunities every year. We are on pace to do that this fiscal year albeit the environment is pretty uncertain, but our deployment and our use of the balance sheet is certainly we see as a strength.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Appreciate the color. And if you could just tell a little bit more color on that, in terms of your ability to integrate and subcontract AI versus develop it indigenously, is it something within your portfolio now that you could develop or if you feel that you need to add sort of capabilities to kind of create your own AI solutions for customers?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think we look at AI as a broad enterprise of product services, technologies and people and we are \u2013 our work is to make sure that AI scales through the federal government and creates real value. It\u2019s clear in demonstration projects and in the lab that this technology offers great promise, but as you know, going from the lab to the field and the scaling process is a major challenge, which we are trying to accelerate. We do that through our own people and capabilities. We do that by investing in option value like [indiscernible]. We do that by building partnerships like our unique partnership with NVIDIA and so forth. And we will continue down this path to ensure that Booz Allen is the one company that can really help the governments, scale these technologies. We are very excited about our work with JAIC. We are very excited about the over 70 programs that we have going on right now and we see this as a growth area well into the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Copeland from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning guys. Hope you are all well. Horacio, I had two questions for you. One, when you look at ET2RC and the JAIC, can you give us any sense of as part of that broader AI effort, what those kind of represented of your kind of near-term pipeline when you think about, what you wanted to go capture and the success you had there relative to what the opportunities maybe? And then secondly on, two of your option value investments, both District Defend and Rec.gov just in the context of what I would assume is a very high demand background for those sorts of capabilities and offerings right now, how that changes or informs your investment case on those? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. You threw a lot at me, Carter, so if I don\u2019t answer any part of it, just come back and we ask it, but let me start with AI. ET2RC is a program that is recompete when all the program that used to be called Global Threat Mitigation program. It was actually the first billion dollar win at Booz Allen. So, it was significant because of that, but it was also significant, because of the work \u2013 the underlying work. And the underlying work is to protect troops in the battlefield from emerging threats, originally about IEDs and now that has grown to a broader range of threats. And so what we are using is AI and virtual learning and a number of technologies to make sure that our clients can in fact move faster down, deploying, training, sometimes down range on many places and especially in this environment, very fast. The JAIC win we have talked about before, there is other things in the pipeline that make me very optimistic that again, we are getting traction on artificial intelligence as a premier provider. It\u2019s core to our strategy, not just AI, but being the company that brings these new technologies to bear in the federal government in a way that are implementable into the mission. So, whether it\u2019s that, whether it\u2019s cloud adoption in a different way, we want to be that catalyst for technological change inside the government and our clients are giving us that opportunity. And again, I see more of that in the future. With regards to the option value portfolio, it continues to progress nicely. You can imagine that Rec.gov itself gave us some concern earlier in the year, because it\u2019s primarily a site around the national parks and we weren\u2019t sure, it\u2019s tourism-related and the tourism industry has been hit very hard, but in fact people have turned to the national parks quite a bit. And so we are seeing good momentum there better than we anticipated. Going into the year, District, we continue to develop the technology and there is increased interest in it, because it allows for safer remote delivery, safer telework, but also mods in the context of all of the AI wins and our Directed Energy Initiative is also progressing very nicely. So, I think all-in-all, I would leave you with our strategies working. We remain in a growth posture and everything we are doing plus hopefully some opportunities that get created by our balance sheet make me optimistic about where we are going.\nCarter Copeland: Great. Thanks for the color.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edward Caso from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nEdward Caso: Hi, good morning. Congrats on another solid quarter. I was trying to get a little bit more details on your exposure to the intelligence community. You said it was about 25% of revenue. I was curious how much of the revenue is being covered now by Section 3610, either others have said 8% to 12% of powers, can you can you provide some kind of number like that? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: It would be difficult for us to do that. The impact that we are seeing as we mentioned in the last call really has been around seeing. And to that extent, we had expected it to be 6 million per month. In actuality, it\u2019s a little bit less than that large part because the clients have allowed for telework approvals. We expect that will continue to evolve, the longer we get into the year, but that\u2019s the most significant impact we are seeing as it relates to our national security work.\nEdward Caso: Just my other question is on the ability to hire, I think I heard your comments say that your head started virtual hiring, but you are now ramping it up. Other companies have said that they have been doing it before they seemed like it was a natural flow. So I didn\u2019t know if you are a little behind the competition on hiring through this new model and also given the work that you do will assume a higher percentage of clearances are required. Is there any sort of friction in the clearance process that slowed your ability to hire and deploy? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. On the virtual client, we have always had that as a component of our recruiting. It obviously now is a larger component to the recruiting since we are all in a virtual world. So, we are not saying that we are behind at all in fact for the type of talent that we have been sourcing and pursuing. We are very pleased with our performance up to this point. As it relates to the care community, that\u2019s always a challenging set of candidates. I would say it remains so even in this environment. That being said, the government is still conducting background investigations and on par with the usual timing even \u2013 given the situation we are in. So that\u2019s always going to remain a headwind, particularly for certain levels of classification, but the overall recruiting performance, we are very pleased with the results today.\nEdward Caso: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. So terrific Q2 book, terrific first quarter bookings. Was any of that bigger reflective of slips from the fourth quarter or pull-forwards from the second quarter? And given that the second quarter is usually your strongest, I think you do about 2x, should we still look for the second quarter to be very, very strong or note that this quarter steal some of that?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, you know \u2013 thank you for that, Cai. Let\u2019s look at our bookings in two parts. First one, on tactical sales dimension, we are on par, on pace in that category. So we are winning work that we expected both in terms of recompete as well as new work and that\u2019s one contribution to our outstanding performance in Q1. The other part as we have said previously is we are pursuing larger opportunities. And it\u2019s going to introduce volatility, because the timing of which is a little bit less certain. Several of those that Horacio highlighted in his opening comments came to fruition, whether it was going to be Q2 or Q1, only the government can decide, but they stayed true to their timing of awards and we are very pleased to win. As it relates to Q2, as you know, it coincides with the end of the government fiscal year. We are in the midst of a heavy procurement season. We are performing well and we would expect that we would be on par with our usual cyclicality of our bookings when we get Q2.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And then on the issue of M&A, one of your competitors made the point that they wouldn\u2019t do any deals in the current environment, because it\u2019s extremely difficult to do adequate due diligence on the virtual basis. Do you feel the same and would you do any deals before kind of COVID is behind us?\nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, I will start. I don\u2019t think we feel the same way. We are known to be conservative and disciplined in our approach. We are going to be conservative and discipline in our approach, but we have transition to virtual work I think better than most and that\u2019s not just in our service of clients, it\u2019s in the way we work internally. And so I feel that if the opportunity presented itself we would not pass or delay it, because we are in the middle of the pandemic.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gavin Parsons from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nGavin Parsons: Hey, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Gavin.\nGavin Parsons: Just wanted to touch on margins a little bit, I mean, lowest fixed price mix in a long time, a lot of COVID impacts. Obviously, you mentioned some of the pieces that helped, I just wanted to kind of ask higher level, is there a natural margin ceiling or how much further can you expand in the quarter specifically, did you turn off any investment or R&D just because of uncertainty, but it doesn\u2019t sound like it?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, we are very pleased with our margin performance despite the unprecedented operating environment. You may recall, we believe we have gotten here through a lot of operational excellence, executing the business well, our business leaders are sensitive and cognizant of not only the top line, but bottom line when it comes to job profitability. And so all of that, we believe, has contributed to our performance today. We are going to continue to operate the business well, as we forecasted for the year we expect to end that around approximately 10%. It\u2019s a normal rhythm to our business where the seasonal spending in the second half is higher, and we have a bit of a dip in visibility in the second half. Although beyond that, we are on pace to land where we expected and how we forecasted we have not done anything unusual to the business as it relates to not investing, as we said that our year end close, we are investing in our people, we are going to continue to do that. And the normal rhythm of our business is that the business produces opportunities to invest in, we consider it closely and we pulled the trigger if it if it has merit with that no difference than any other year that we are working through. So at the end of the day, it really has been the operational excellence and execution by our business leaders.\nGavin Parsons: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, as a hypothetical, obviously, it\u2019s difficult to forecast the longer-term trajectory of the budget with all the uncertainty that we have today and the fiscal deficit and the election. But if you take a look at the last budget downturn where, obviously you guys outperformed the end market that seemed liked your end market was more impacted than the kind of broader defense or government budget on average. So I am just curious if we have a budget downturn going forward, whether or not you think today that kind of that the government IT end market might be relatively less impacted than say it was last time during a budget downturn? Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: I guess I will try and take that, I will say first that my crystal ball is a little cloudy this morning. But I will answer the following we remain in a growth posture. What I believe is that there is opportunity to continue to help our clients make this transformation towards digital and towards new technologies, and then if anything in a tight budget, those are going to become more important because of the efficiencies that they create. And so we are well positioned, I believe as a company to capture upside from effectiveness, but also capture upside from efficiency as we help our clients make this transition and that is why to your earlier question Lloyd said what we say which is we are going to invest in our business and in our people and we are going to drive forward our goal is always to out pace the end market and we have been doing that for a long time through ups and downs and we intend to do the same\nGavin Parsons: Make sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Hey, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could touch on the impact from the CARES Act lost fee work, how that sort of trended as you move through the quarter and July and also how fast kind of over the same period people might be able to return to some of those locations that they may not have been able to access?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. We had expected that the significant impact would be international security accounts, largely around the inability to invoice for fee, and we estimate at the time, about a $6 million per month on headwind. The reality is it came in a little bit less than that, large part because our clients were approving of us to support them with telework. We also had shifted as the many in the sector to a shift work arrangement to continue to support those critical missions. Like Horacio\u2019s crystal ball, mine is equally cloudy as to how long or at what rate, the government will make adjustments, but we are in heavy discussions with our clients. And as with any uncertainty involving the virus, we just need to remain agile. At the end of the day we built in this to our forecast and we still expect to finish at approximately 10% on margins by the end of the year. But as it relates to the CARES Act, that\u2019s been the impact up to this point. As we said in our prepared remarks, we are going to come up on the September 30 and we will see what adjustments at that time the government makes or not.\nMatt Akers: Great. Thanks. And then I guess one other I think last quarter, you had mentioned PPP time-off as maybe a variable kind of in the later part of the year. If I look at kind of your productivity, just like revenue per employee and the quarter looks like it was pretty strong. So I guess could you just kind of touch on how your employees are kind of managing why they were so productive in the quarter and if that maybe could be a little bit of a headwind as we move throughout the year?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. I will start, I am sure Horacio would jump in. Our employees have been great. I want to talk about seamless transition to a virtual environment, not losing much of anything around productivity. Everyone has been running 100% plus since March. And I think from a numerical standpoint, you see what result that was able to yield. At the same time, everyone runs the risk of burnout. And so we have been encouraging our people to take care of themselves, physically, mentally as part of our constant communication with our folks and through our leaders. And we have seen a modest uptick in people beginning to take PTO. And we actually see people come back, recharge. That will continue to be our messaging. As Horacio said, the $100million resiliency fund is in place and we fully intend to take advantage of that on the benefit of our employees. But everyone has been extremely productive, but now we are shifting to making sure that everyone is taking care of themselves at the same time.\nHoracio Rozanski: I don\u2019t have much to add other than echoing Lloyd\u2019s shout out to our people, especially this has been hard on people without a doubt and especially on families, people who are taking care of elderly relatives and yet they have not skipped a beat. They are working hard. We are looking for ways to support them into the fall. We are being as creative as innovative as we possibly can and our team has responded really well to the fact that we are in it together.\nMatt Akers: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Yes, good morning. Lloyd, I think this is for you. When you look across your three government customers, defense, intel and civil, can you just talk about how you look at your market share within each one of those customers? And then what our realistic market share is 5 \u2013 or 8 years from now, just in the context of this, because we do see kind of a tougher budget environment, your ability to grow just from continuing to gain share? Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Yes, Joe, it\u2019s a great question, but it\u2019s a challenge to answer, because the metrics by which you would traditionally look at share are a bit perverted as we kind of see opportunities and pursue them. So, case in point, the government now is bundling more and more different capabilities albeit within a market. And so, if you try to define in terms of capability, it\u2019s not exact and then frankly, internally, it\u2019s not a metric that our business leaders are focused on. By proxy, our win rates are at the same level as we exited FY \u201820. For recompetes, we are winning at 90%, for new work slightly over 60% and simply put, if we are winning, someone is losing, so I like the fact that our win rates are sustaining. We have traditionally outpaced the market from an organic growth perspective. Now, we are off to a great start, but I struggled today to break it down in terms of share percentage just given how the calculation would be a bit cloudy.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes, I think the only thing I will add is the last time we looked at this we are essentially single-digit market share across all of our primary end-markets. And so I don\u2019t think we are cap and if anything the expansion of work that we're doing around capabilities, around option value and so forth I think opens up new available markets to us. So I believe this notion that we're in a growth posture needs to be with us and that we are going to invest in this business through the upturns but also through the down turns in the overall budget picture if I think what is going to make Booz Allen continue to succeed over time.\nJoseph DeNardi: That\u2019s helpful. And Horacio you mentioned earlier that the kind of the value proposition of IT modernization should become more compelling to your customer in a more constrained budget environment can you just talk about the level of confidence you have that the customer will actually recognize that and kind of act rationally from a budget standpoint because I am not sure that historically that\u2019s always been the case whether you think budget management and spending where investments are actually more appropriate will be different going forward than it has in the past? Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure I will tell you over the last decade may be as a result of the increased challenges in terms of budgets in congress and all of that our end clients have become more sophisticated about how they prioritize and how they manage than they use to be. When sequestration came online, if you want to go all the way back there are clients started in the way that frankly many companies start with these discussions which is cuts across the board and so forth but very quickly move to prioritizing what was most needed what was most important and then cutting something\u2019s that were less important more deeply I think that is now a skill set that is in the muscle memory of especially the larger federal agencies that we serve and so I would expect that that will be the approach and again I would say if I take that from a Booz Allen\u2019s first of all I think we have broad range of technology capabilities that will help them to that and then secondly the combination that we are so broad across the government and that our single P&L business model actually allows us to flex quickly is what I think gives me some level of confidence that should there be a change in the budget posture we will weather that well.\nJoseph DeNardi: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call over to Horacio Rozanski, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you very much and thanks everyone for your time and for your questions this mornings. As always, Lloyd and I are proud to represent the people of Booz Allen as another fiscal year gets on their way. It is our people\u2019s skills, their passion, their values that power our firm quarter after quarter and year after year and because of them I will say it again, we will look to the future with confidence. So until next time I hope your families stay safe and remain healthy. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Will and welcome to the earnings calls. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I would like to start this morning in a somewhat unconventional way, but one that is very much in keeping with our culture at Booz Allen. At the start of every leadership meeting, we usually take a moment to focus on an aspect of our purpose and values. And today, we would like to do the same here. Booz Allen's purpose is to empower people to change the world, to empower people to change the world. And to us, it's not a guideline it's a statement that guides our thinking and our actions. In recent weeks, prompted by the horrific killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there has been a reckoning in our country about deep seated racial inequity and a long overdue acknowledgement of the pain felt in the Black community. Inside our firm, we have encouraged open, direct and at times, very difficult conversations about racism and injustice. Thousands of us have participated in the virtual hands, many more joint team meetings and listening sessions and communicated with us through e-mails and one-on-one discussions with me and other senior leaders. Our colleagues have offered deeply personal stories, ideas, feedback, calls for action and a real passion for change. At a personal level, I have learned and I have grown through each interaction. I am deeply grateful for the honesty and the trust that people have extended to me. And as the leader of this firm, I am committed to doing more, because when at Booz Allen, we say that black lives matter, we are not making a political statement, we are making a statement about our values. In early June, our firm committed publicly to taking action along six dimensions. Our ways and social equity agenda has both internal and external elements. The six points are as follows. Number one, we will undertake an independent assessment of our business practices affected people of color. Second, we will intensify our efforts and accountability to increase representation of people of color at all levels. Third, we have already increased personal time and space as well as resources for our employees' mental health. Fourth, we are accelerating diversity and inclusion learning opportunities for all employees. Fifth, we are making race and social justice, a major element of our corporate philanthropy. And sixth, Booz Allen has a unique voice and unique capabilities. And combined with our talents, we will use them to advance social justice through work with our community partners. What we heard from our people, what I heard from our people is that they want Booz Allen to be a sustained catalyst for change. And with that in mind, we have crafted a comprehensive agenda that will endure and we've all got to learn. It's not just the right thing to do and not just of this moment. Our purpose and values demand that we take action today and into the future. Lloyd, you have been a leader in this effort, offering guidance and insights that have been crucial to shaping our agenda. I know you want to add your voice to this conversation. So let me turn the floor over to you. Thank you, Lloyd. I couldn't agree more and thanks again for your leadership. Lloyd and I felt strongly that we needed to begin our earnings call on this topic, because the outstanding performance that we discuss with you, our analysts and our investors year after year rests on the foundation of our people, our purpose and our passion. Let's turn now to set business performance. As you saw in the press release, we have another excellent first quarter. The business is operating well and we continue to support our clients, invest in our people, and manage through the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite all the things that are different and more challenging than in a typical year, our team has delivered another strong start. Our people continue to demonstrate their value to clients, missions and this institution in these truly unprecedented times. It is my highest priority shared by every member of the board and the leadership team to make them feel supported and to endeavor to keep them safe, as they do their critical work. Three months into the fiscal year, our financial results aligned with our expectations for the full year. Across all the key metrics, we are pleased with our performance. You will recall from our May earnings call that we forecast a strong first half and a more uncertain second half. At this point, the unknowns in the back half of the year remain. First, we do not know how the pandemic will progress or affect our people, clients and business over the full fiscal year. Second, it is still too early to tell how the federal appropriations process will play out this fall. And third, it is unclear what budget related impact November's election may have. Despite these unknowns, we are affirming our guidance for the fiscal year and we are looking for opportunities to use our strong balance sheet as a strategic asset. Turning now to the pandemic and Booz Allen's response. As we have said before, we see it evolving in three phases. The first phase, emergency response was from late January through April. Now and for most of this fiscal year, we expect to be in Phase 2, the period when the virus is still circulating and there is no proven treatment or vaccine. We continue to emphasize telework with more than 80% of our billable work being done remotely. And we have collaborated closely with clients to put hundreds of safe return plans in place for those whose work requires them to be at a facility. Also, we are pleased that a significant portion of the $100 million will set aside the response to the pandemic remain available. Throughout the year, we will continue supporting our people and investing in health and safety programs. During the first quarter, our leaders executed the business well, recruiting and hiring talent, managing contracts, winning new opportunities, developing our capabilities and making progress on our option value portfolio. Our defense and civil markets, representing three quarters of our business continue to deliver robust growth. The intelligence market has been more affected by the pandemic, but it's showing positive signs in terms of our recruiting and opportunity pipeline. And in global commercial, we continue to see strength in our cyber oriented work. Across all markets, we are positioned at the intersection of mission and technology, where demand is robust. Our book-to-bill ratio was a first quarter record and we are especially excited about the content and quality of the work. Significant awards across the portfolio show that we have invested in the right capabilities to support our government as it scales new technologies into mission. For example, under a nearly $1 billion recompete win, we will help the Army expand use of virtual reality and artificial intelligence tools in critical learning. The program called Emergent Threat, Training, and Readiness Capability, or ET2RC is delivered on basis worldwide. We are extremely proud of this work, because it helps protect for well deployed soldiers from emerging threats. A second example is our work at the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, or JAIC, where we are helping to source and integrate the best AI technologies into priority DoD missions. The contract announced in May is about operationalizing AI at scale and represents our biggest most strategic win to-date, spanning a portfolio of about 70 AI projects across multiple federal agencies. And finally, I will mention a significant digital transformation win at the IRS. Under a contract called Enterprise Case Management Solution Integrator Services, we are building an enterprise-wide case management platform that will help modernize IRS systems, reduce costs, improve efficiency and vastly improve service to taxpayers. These programs and many other opportunities in our pipelines will continue to show Booz Allen as the premier provider of mission-critical technologies to federal agencies. Even as we continue to execute our business exceptionally well, our leadership team is positioned for the future. We intend to take all that we have learned through Vision 2020 and throughout this pandemic and apply going forward. Through our innovation agenda, we continue to develop core and option value technologies that we know clients need to advance their mission. We are strengthening our IT infrastructure, including modernization of our financial systems. These technology investments support telework, create efficiencies, enable growth and prepare us for emerging business needs. We are also preparing for increased volatility in the economy, financial markets and budget outlook. We have spoken about those in terms of challenges, but they also present opportunities. We are actively scanning and plan to be aggressive in deploying capital at the right time to maximize value for our firm and our shareholders. In sum, from a position of strength, we are laying the groundwork for continued growth and market leadership. This approach has been the key to our institution success for more than a century. We believe it is also the core of our value proposition to investors today. And with that, Lloyd, over to you for more in depth look at our first quarter results. Sheila, good morning. It's Horacio. Why don't I start and I am sure Lloyd will want to add. Let me first acknowledge the hardships that the pandemic is causing on people, on our clients really in the entire country. I have been in discussions with several senior clients and I have been impressed by how thoughtful and how focused they are. They are thinking about the total force meaning their people and our people together and we are working in partnership through the safe return process. Our goals as you know are to protect the health and safety of our people, to serve our clients and to maintain our financial strength and resilience and thanks to all of these combined efforts by the government and by Booz Allen. We are operating at pre-pandemic levels, essentially. You look at the demand environment it continues to be very strong. You saw it in our book-to-bill. We have a very healthy pipeline. Our clients \u2013 we don't see in some pockets things might be moving to the right a little bit, but by and large, the demand environment continues to be very strong and clients are if anything any even more focused when bringing technology to bear, to tackle these issues, they have moved to telework, just like we have and we are talking about remote delivery for the long runs. And this has also unearthed some needs in their networks, in their systems for cybersecurity, for cloud, for a number of things. So, all-in-all, I think we are going to continue to see this kind of focus and this kind of moving going forward. The only thing I will add to that is just to say that all the work that we have done both on our social justice agenda and before that on pandemic response, I think as if anything strengthen, our value proposition both inside Booz Allen and our brand as an employer. So, we have reason to believe that we will continue to see the level of success going forward. Why don't I start and I am sure again Lloyd will want to add. As you pointed out, we are looking at opportunities in the market very assertively. Our balance sheet is very strong. Our strategy is now clearly any focus. And so we know what we are looking for. It's mostly tuck-ins that allow us to bring in unique technologies and unique positions to clients that accelerate our growth. The pipeline is beginning to build nicely after some fits and starts at the beginning of the pandemic. And we intend to scan things assertively. We are not going to deviate from the level of discipline we normally bring, but we are prepared to take advantage of volatility in asset prices and ensure that we are capturing what we need. I think we look at AI as a broad enterprise of product services, technologies and people and we are \u2013 our work is to make sure that AI scales through the federal government and creates real value. It's clear in demonstration projects and in the lab that this technology offers great promise, but as you know, going from the lab to the field and the scaling process is a major challenge, which we are trying to accelerate. We do that through our own people and capabilities. We do that by investing in option value like [indiscernible]. We do that by building partnerships like our unique partnership with NVIDIA and so forth. And we will continue down this path to ensure that Booz Allen is the one company that can really help the governments, scale these technologies. We are very excited about our work with JAIC. We are very excited about the over 70 programs that we have going on right now and we see this as a growth area well into the future. Sure. You threw a lot at me, Carter, so if I don't answer any part of it, just come back and we ask it, but let me start with AI. ET2RC is a program that is recompete when all the program that used to be called Global Threat Mitigation program. It was actually the first billion dollar win at Booz Allen. So, it was significant because of that, but it was also significant, because of the work \u2013 the underlying work. And the underlying work is to protect troops in the battlefield from emerging threats, originally about IEDs and now that has grown to a broader range of threats. And so what we are using is AI and virtual learning and a number of technologies to make sure that our clients can in fact move faster down, deploying, training, sometimes down range on many places and especially in this environment, very fast. The JAIC win we have talked about before, there is other things in the pipeline that make me very optimistic that again, we are getting traction on artificial intelligence as a premier provider. It's core to our strategy, not just AI, but being the company that brings these new technologies to bear in the federal government in a way that are implementable into the mission. So, whether it's that, whether it's cloud adoption in a different way, we want to be that catalyst for technological change inside the government and our clients are giving us that opportunity. And again, I see more of that in the future. With regards to the option value portfolio, it continues to progress nicely. You can imagine that Rec.gov itself gave us some concern earlier in the year, because it's primarily a site around the national parks and we weren't sure, it's tourism-related and the tourism industry has been hit very hard, but in fact people have turned to the national parks quite a bit. And so we are seeing good momentum there better than we anticipated. Going into the year, District, we continue to develop the technology and there is increased interest in it, because it allows for safer remote delivery, safer telework, but also mods in the context of all of the AI wins and our Directed Energy Initiative is also progressing very nicely. So, I think all-in-all, I would leave you with our strategies working. We remain in a growth posture and everything we are doing plus hopefully some opportunities that get created by our balance sheet make me optimistic about where we are going. Sure. It would be difficult for us to do that. The impact that we are seeing as we mentioned in the last call really has been around seeing. And to that extent, we had expected it to be 6 million per month. In actuality, it's a little bit less than that large part because the clients have allowed for telework approvals. We expect that will continue to evolve, the longer we get into the year, but that's the most significant impact we are seeing as it relates to our national security work. Sure. On the virtual client, we have always had that as a component of our recruiting. It obviously now is a larger component to the recruiting since we are all in a virtual world. So, we are not saying that we are behind at all in fact for the type of talent that we have been sourcing and pursuing. We are very pleased with our performance up to this point. As it relates to the care community, that's always a challenging set of candidates. I would say it remains so even in this environment. That being said, the government is still conducting background investigations and on par with the usual timing even \u2013 given the situation we are in. So that's always going to remain a headwind, particularly for certain levels of classification, but the overall recruiting performance, we are very pleased with the results today. Cai, I will start. I don't think we feel the same way. We are known to be conservative and disciplined in our approach. We are going to be conservative and discipline in our approach, but we have transition to virtual work I think better than most and that's not just in our service of clients, it's in the way we work internally. And so I feel that if the opportunity presented itself we would not pass or delay it, because we are in the middle of the pandemic. Sure. Good morning, Gavin. I guess I will try and take that, I will say first that my crystal ball is a little cloudy this morning. But I will answer the following we remain in a growth posture. What I believe is that there is opportunity to continue to help our clients make this transformation towards digital and towards new technologies, and then if anything in a tight budget, those are going to become more important because of the efficiencies that they create. And so we are well positioned, I believe as a company to capture upside from effectiveness, but also capture upside from efficiency as we help our clients make this transition and that is why to your earlier question Lloyd said what we say which is we are going to invest in our business and in our people and we are going to drive forward our goal is always to out pace the end market and we have been doing that for a long time through ups and downs and we intend to do the same I don't have much to add other than echoing Lloyd's shout out to our people, especially this has been hard on people without a doubt and especially on families, people who are taking care of elderly relatives and yet they have not skipped a beat. They are working hard. We are looking for ways to support them into the fall. We are being as creative as innovative as we possibly can and our team has responded really well to the fact that we are in it together. Yes, I think the only thing I will add is the last time we looked at this we are essentially single-digit market share across all of our primary end-markets. And so I don't think we are cap and if anything the expansion of work that we're doing around capabilities, around option value and so forth I think opens up new available markets to us. So I believe this notion that we're in a growth posture needs to be with us and that we are going to invest in this business through the upturns but also through the down turns in the overall budget picture if I think what is going to make Booz Allen continue to succeed over time. Sure I will tell you over the last decade may be as a result of the increased challenges in terms of budgets in congress and all of that our end clients have become more sophisticated about how they prioritize and how they manage than they use to be. When sequestration came online, if you want to go all the way back there are clients started in the way that frankly many companies start with these discussions which is cuts across the board and so forth but very quickly move to prioritizing what was most needed what was most important and then cutting something's that were less important more deeply I think that is now a skill set that is in the muscle memory of especially the larger federal agencies that we serve and so I would expect that that will be the approach and again I would say if I take that from a Booz Allen's first of all I think we have broad range of technology capabilities that will help them to that and then secondly the combination that we are so broad across the government and that our single P&L business model actually allows us to flex quickly is what I think gives me some level of confidence that should there be a change in the budget posture we will weather that well. Thank you very much and thanks everyone for your time and for your questions this mornings. As always, Lloyd and I are proud to represent the people of Booz Allen as another fiscal year gets on their way. It is our people's skills, their passion, their values that power our firm quarter after quarter and year after year and because of them I will say it again, we will look to the future with confidence. So until next time I hope your families stay safe and remain healthy. Have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio. The past few months have been challenging for our country and our firm. July 18th marked 32 years since the day I joined Booz Allen. When I say this firm is my family, I mean it. And just like with all families, sometimes difficult conversations are needed. This is one of those times. I am proud to be part of one of the most diverse leadership teams in Corporate America today. Our Board of Directors is also much more diverse than most. This is clearly a firm that cares about people and about diversity and inclusion. But it is also clear that we have work to do inside Booz Allen and throughout society. Our race and social equity agenda acknowledges that. It says that to be a force for change in the world we must start by ensuring that every person at our firm feels empowered that those who have been more marginalized in the past know they have a voice, a seat at the table and an opportunity to thrive. I have experienced this firm as a place of opportunity and I believe that it can be a force for good in the world. That's what we are doing here all those years ago, called me back after a short stint on Wall Street and that's kept me at our firm since. Furthermore, this is an issue all of our stakeholders care about, from employees and clients, through strategic partners and investors. I look forward to the progress we can make together and to continuing the journey with you, Horacio, and the rest of my colleagues. Thanks, Horacio. I am tremendously proud not only of our performance in the first quarter, but also of the dedication and determination exhibited by our people. Their commitment to our firm, their colleagues and our clients' mission is unwavering. They have risen to the challenge of operating in an unprecedented environment and our very strong start to fiscal year 2021 gives us confidence that we can meet our goals for the full year. We are now in the final year of our 3-year investment thesis and remain committed to maximizing shareholder value in both the near and long-term. Our first quarter results maintained our consistent record of strong financial performance. Additionally, we continued to grow our headcount and had a record first quarter book-to-bill positioning us well for the full year. We continue to invest in our people, capabilities and technology, preparing Booz Allen for fiscal year 2022 and beyond. And we have the balance sheet strength to take advantage of potential future market volatility, while augmenting our operating performance with opportunistic capital deployment. I will now cover our first quarter results. Please turn to Slide 6. Starting at the top line, revenue and revenue excluding billable expenses, increased 7.2% and 10.5% respectively compared to the same quarter last year. Growth continues to be fueled by strong demand for our services and solutions, particularly in our defense and civil businesses and an increase in headcount to meet that demand. It also reflects our success first in transitioning most of our work to remote delivery and now where required and a portion of it back on to Booz Allen or client site. Revenue growth this quarter was impacted by lower than typical billable expenses, primarily due to COVID-19. We anticipate continued volatility in billable expenses, because the timing and magnitude of things like travel, equipment purchases, subcontractors and other direct costs remain uncertain. However, as we have said in the past, revenue, excluding billable expenses, is where we generate most of our profit, and therefore is the metric we focus on internally. Turning to Slide 7, our book-to-bill was 2.2x a first quarter record. Our trailing 12-month figure is now 1.4x revenue. We continue to augment our traditional foundation of diversified small awards by pursuing larger and more complex that by their nature caused quarter-to-quarter volatility in book-to-bill. As a case in point, during our first quarter, we booked several large awards, including those who Horacio mentioned, which helped increase total backlog by 16% to a record high $23 billion. Funded backlog was up 8% to $3.4 billion, unfunded backlog grew 9% to $4.7 billion, and price options rose 21% to $14.8 billion. Today, COVID-19 has not slowed down the award environment. This is a credit to our clients and contracting officers as they continue to issue requests for proposals and awards in a remote work setting. Pivoting to headcount, as of June 30, we had 27,381 employees, up 997 year-over-year or 3.8%. For the quarter, we added 208 employees. We have adapted well to remote hiring and our headcount continues to be buoyed by lower than typical attrition, which we attribute in part to the pandemic resilience program we put in place on April 1. For the year, we remain in a growth posture and intend to increase headcount to meet sustained demand. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $213 million, up 7% year-over-year. On our last call, we estimated that our inability to build for fee on shift work performed in our defense and intelligence markets would create a negative impact of approximately $6 million per month. The actual impact for the first quarter was about $12 million. After accounting for this impact, our increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by top line growth, strong contract level performance and effective cost management. First quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.9% the same as the first quarter last year. Two factors were at play. Lower than expected billable expenses improve adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue, but this was more than offset by unbilled fee in our defense and intelligence markets. The impact to earnings and margin going forward will depend mainly on the pace at which this work continues to fully transition back on site and whether any modifications are made to the CARES Act due to expire after September 30. As noted previously, the potential that this fee will not be recovered is reflected in our guidance range. First quarter net income and adjusted net income grew 10% year-over-year to $129.3 million and $129.9 million respectively. Diluted earnings per share rose 11% to $0.92, while adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.93. These increases were primarily due to our revenue growth, decreased interest expense, a lower tax rate and reduced share count due to our share repurchase program. Turning to cash, we generated $140 million in operating cash during the first quarter, an increase of 175% over the prior year. Cash ended the quarter at $621 million. This strength in cash flow was primarily due to our effective working capital management and lower interest expense. COVID-19 has not materially impacted cash collections as the virtual invoicing process continues to run smoothly. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $20 million. This reflects a shift away from facilities investments towards technology and tools needed to support the virtual work environment. Additionally, we continue to modernize our corporate IT infrastructure. As Horacio mentioned, we are approaching the implementation of a next-generation financial system capable of supporting us through a period of dynamic future growth. Please turn to Slide 8. Our robust operating performance and prudent capital management have resulted in a strong, well-capitalized balance sheet. During the first quarter, we continued to execute a disciplined, value-enhancing capital allocation strategy. In the quarter, we repurchased $76 million worth of shares at an average price of $72 per share. Including dividends, we returned a total of $119 million to shareholders during the quarter. We continue to see the strength of our balance sheet as a source of strategic advantage, particularly as we enter a period of potential uncertainty for our industry and for the broader economy. In times of volatility, well-capitalized firms such as ours can create incremental value through opportunistic acquisitions or timely return of capital to shareholders. In our investment thesis, we set a $1.4 billion deployment target over the 3-year period ending this fiscal year. This remains our objective. And while we anticipate being more aggressive and deploying capital towards attractive opportunities, we will not artificially bias our deployment strategy to meet this objective. We will remain disciplined as we maximize opportunities for our firm and our shareholders. Lastly, today, we are announcing that the company has authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share payable on August 28 to stockholders of record on August 14. Before opening the line for questions, I will briefly touch on our view of the rest of the year and our guidance. Please move to Slide 9. With one quarter behind us, our guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect revenue growth between 6% and 10%, adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 10% and adjusted diluted earnings per share between $3.40 and $3.60. The ADEPS guidance is based on $136 million to $140 million weighted average shares outstanding and a tax rate in the range of 20% to 23%. We are forecasting operating cash to be between $550 million and $600 million and capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $100 million. As expected, we have an excellent start to the year and our strong first quarter sets us up well for the second half. The uncertainties we faced are industry-wide concerns. We expect to manage through any turbulence well as we have in the past and we will be looking for strategic opportunities to un-harness the significant potential of our balance sheet. In closing, we are extremely proud of our first quarter and continue to work towards realizing the 3-year goals captured in our investment thesis. Our firm looks forward to maintaining its record as an industry leader this year and beyond. With that, Will, let's open the lines for questions. Good morning, Sheila. I would just add a couple of more points. On the demand side, we have seen about $20 million in new contract awards and mods to existing contracts that are COVID-related. We have got about $30 million in COVID-related opportunities that we are pursuing. As you heard in our prepared remarks on the recruiting front, albeit the volume lower than we had hoped going into the pandemic, we are winning. We are winning the war in talent. We are able to source, recruit and onboard and deploy our people and I think we are getting better and better at that. The payment offices are operating well. They are paying on invoices. So, I think the government has responded well through the pandemic and we have kept pace with them. I will start \u2013 on the hiring front. I think everyone, the labor market as well as ourselves had to adjust though we had done a modest amount pre-pandemic, it really went full bore in the midst of it. And I would say that candidates have acclimated well as is our hiring managers and our recruiting team. If there is any challenges we value our culture so much, so now that we have added 4% to our workforce, we have colleagues now that haven't physically touched other colleagues. So, we are working through how to have virtual, social hours, things of that sort to maintain that, but I'd say the machinery is working well and we remain optimistic of keeping pace throughout the year. Jon, not much more to add, we are, as Horacio said, continuing to look at options to maximize value for our shareholders in the near, mid and long-term and certainly capability tuck-ins are a part of that. So, we look at over 100 opportunities every year. We are on pace to do that this fiscal year albeit the environment is pretty uncertain, but our deployment and our use of the balance sheet is certainly we see as a strength. Yes, you know \u2013 thank you for that, Cai. Let's look at our bookings in two parts. First one, on tactical sales dimension, we are on par, on pace in that category. So we are winning work that we expected both in terms of recompete as well as new work and that's one contribution to our outstanding performance in Q1. The other part as we have said previously is we are pursuing larger opportunities. And it's going to introduce volatility, because the timing of which is a little bit less certain. Several of those that Horacio highlighted in his opening comments came to fruition, whether it was going to be Q2 or Q1, only the government can decide, but they stayed true to their timing of awards and we are very pleased to win. As it relates to Q2, as you know, it coincides with the end of the government fiscal year. We are in the midst of a heavy procurement season. We are performing well and we would expect that we would be on par with our usual cyclicality of our bookings when we get Q2. Yes, we are very pleased with our margin performance despite the unprecedented operating environment. You may recall, we believe we have gotten here through a lot of operational excellence, executing the business well, our business leaders are sensitive and cognizant of not only the top line, but bottom line when it comes to job profitability. And so all of that, we believe, has contributed to our performance today. We are going to continue to operate the business well, as we forecasted for the year we expect to end that around approximately 10%. It's a normal rhythm to our business where the seasonal spending in the second half is higher, and we have a bit of a dip in visibility in the second half. Although beyond that, we are on pace to land where we expected and how we forecasted we have not done anything unusual to the business as it relates to not investing, as we said that our year end close, we are investing in our people, we are going to continue to do that. And the normal rhythm of our business is that the business produces opportunities to invest in, we consider it closely and we pulled the trigger if it if it has merit with that no difference than any other year that we are working through. So at the end of the day, it really has been the operational excellence and execution by our business leaders. Sure. We had expected that the significant impact would be international security accounts, largely around the inability to invoice for fee, and we estimate at the time, about a $6 million per month on headwind. The reality is it came in a little bit less than that, large part because our clients were approving of us to support them with telework. We also had shifted as the many in the sector to a shift work arrangement to continue to support those critical missions. Like Horacio's crystal ball, mine is equally cloudy as to how long or at what rate, the government will make adjustments, but we are in heavy discussions with our clients. And as with any uncertainty involving the virus, we just need to remain agile. At the end of the day we built in this to our forecast and we still expect to finish at approximately 10% on margins by the end of the year. But as it relates to the CARES Act, that's been the impact up to this point. As we said in our prepared remarks, we are going to come up on the September 30 and we will see what adjustments at that time the government makes or not. Sure. I will start, I am sure Horacio would jump in. Our employees have been great. I want to talk about seamless transition to a virtual environment, not losing much of anything around productivity. Everyone has been running 100% plus since March. And I think from a numerical standpoint, you see what result that was able to yield. At the same time, everyone runs the risk of burnout. And so we have been encouraging our people to take care of themselves, physically, mentally as part of our constant communication with our folks and through our leaders. And we have seen a modest uptick in people beginning to take PTO. And we actually see people come back, recharge. That will continue to be our messaging. As Horacio said, the $100million resiliency fund is in place and we fully intend to take advantage of that on the benefit of our employees. But everyone has been extremely productive, but now we are shifting to making sure that everyone is taking care of themselves at the same time. Yes, Joe, it's a great question, but it's a challenge to answer, because the metrics by which you would traditionally look at share are a bit perverted as we kind of see opportunities and pursue them. So, case in point, the government now is bundling more and more different capabilities albeit within a market. And so, if you try to define in terms of capability, it's not exact and then frankly, internally, it's not a metric that our business leaders are focused on. By proxy, our win rates are at the same level as we exited FY \u201820. For recompetes, we are winning at 90%, for new work slightly over 60% and simply put, if we are winning, someone is losing, so I like the fact that our win rates are sustaining. We have traditionally outpaced the market from an organic growth perspective. Now, we are off to a great start, but I struggled today to break it down in terms of share percentage just given how the calculation would be a bit cloudy."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Ms. Laura Adams. Please go ahead.\nLaura Adams: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 earnings call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. I'm Laura Adams, Senior Vice President and Treasurer and Interim Head of Investor Relations. And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking, which may relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment this morning to acknowledge the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine, and share how Booz Allen is responding. As millions of people fleet a country or are displaced, the need for humanitarian assistance and protection grows more acute every day. In response, we committed to provide aid through an employee giving campaign and company match. Our employees' engagement in the campaign has been tremendous, and I am grateful for their generosity and compassion. From a mission perspective, our teams in Europe and the U.S. are supporting our clients across a broad range of areas. They are working around the clock to deliver critical capabilities and insights to our clients, true to our purpose. They are working relentlessly to change the world. I'm thankful for their dedication, the extraordinary power of their work, and the difference they're making to our teams supporting these missions. On behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you. Thank you for the work you're doing and the sacrifices you are making to serve our clients and the nation. It's an honor to call you our colleagues. Today, and always, our thoughts remain with the Ukrainian people, and we hope for a peaceful and just resolution to the conflict soon. This morning, Lloyd and I are pleased to report our results for fiscal year 2022. In a year marked by exceptional volatility, Booz Allen committed to a new growth strategy and multiyear financials, invested in our future and managed the business with precision and skill. I am extremely proud of the work and the impact our leaders and our entire team have made. Their talent and dedication underpin the results we shared with you today. For the full fiscal year, bottom line results were excellent. Revenue growth was also solid, but below our expectations set a year ago. We remain steadfast to our operational priorities throughout the year, culminating in growth across all markets in both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. We adeptly controlled costs to deliver on both our bottom line commitments and invested in our future and our people. One year into our multiyear investment thesis, we have made strong strategic progress and are on track to deliver against our goals. Over the next few moments, I will set the strategic context for our financial performance, and then Lloyd will take you through FY 2022 results and FY 2023 guidance in depth. As we shared with you on Investor Day, Booz Allen believes that the rapidly evolving challenges confronting our nation will accelerate the pace of change in our government's missions and use of technology. 5 to 10 years from now, technologies from 5G to AI and from blockchain to Quantum will be ubiquitous across a range of missions. And because we have been preparing for this for over a decade, we believe Booz Allen holds a strategic first-mover advantage. We have the opportunity to help our clients through their transformation to digital missions, and we are poised to convert this extraordinary opportunity into growth that creates long-term shareholder value. At Investor Day, we introduced VoLT, our growth strategy. VoLT reflects our ambitions and guides us as we build the Booz Allen of the future. In our next era, we will scale Booz Allen to an even greater level of industry leadership. We will be the premier partner to the federal government, continuously bringing innovation to national priority missions, faster than the pace of change. VoLT stands for velocity, leadership and technology. These three words are the fundamental principles for how we are transforming to achieve our aspirations. We advanced with velocity, investing ahead of emerging technology waves and expanding our market positions through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We redefine leadership, investing in people with the right expertise to lead and scale hyper growth businesses at the mission technology intersection. And we apply next generation technology, creating differentiated intellectual capital and property to address our clients' needs at/or ahead of mission demands. Today, I am excited to tell you that VoLT is underway. As we operationalize the strategy, two success factors are clear. One, we need to make decisions faster to accelerate our growth. Two, our transformation will require relentless focus and seamless integration. This is why at the outset, we are taking an important step to address these needs. I\u2019m excited to announce that we have named Executive Vice President and Civil Sector President, Kristine Martin Anderson as Booz Allen\u2019s Chief Operating Officer. This appointment by the Board of Directors is effective June 1. Kristine is a proven leader who perceives opportunities amid challenges. In leading both our health team and our civil market, she has demonstrated the ability to grow and manage technology first businesses, develop talented leaders, help senior clients transform and integrate acquisitions. All while consistently delivering strong financial results. As our COO, Kristine will play a major role in Vault, taking primary responsibility for accelerating firm wide operational performance and the transformation of our business model, in collaboration with leaders from across the firm. I've had the personal pleasure of working with Kristine for many years. I look forward to partnering with her more closely in her new role for years to come. As a result of Kristine's changing role, Rich Crowe, currently Chief Growth Officer has been named Civil Sector President. Rich is a seasoned and innovative business leader who previously led and scaled the health account to its market leading position. An accomplished leader in his own right, Rich is also an indication of the depth of talent we are lucky to have in our firm. I hope you'll have a chance to meet Kristine and Rich at future events. Now allow me to share additional details on the progress we are making on Vault. Foundational to our strategy is building businesses at the intersection of mission and technology. As of April 1, we formally launched two operational business units, aligned to mission areas we believe are critical to our nation and prime for hyper growth. We have nested digital battle space inside our global defense sector. This is where we are innovating to help the Department of Defense securely drive information to the edge, to create decision advantage. By applying AI, machine learning, 5G and other emerging technologies to the joint warfighting mission, the women and men who defend our country will have superior situational awareness to make better decisions faster. National cyber, a core element of our national security sector builds on our leading position in the intelligence community. We have delivered innovative cyber trade-craft to these clients for decades and recognized that the cyber domain is horizontal and not vertical. Therefore, we are now extending and expanding our reach into scalable cyber solutions for a broader set of clients across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. Our focus is on cyber network operations and protecting critical infrastructure. With the organizational launch of these two mission-centric businesses, we now have dedicated leaders and technical talent aligned to drive the team forward and deliver on a clear set of objectives. We have also taken the time to reimagine our innovation agenda. As of April 1, we integrated our IT infrastructure and innovation functions into a newly created Chief Technology Office led by Susan Penfield. This organization leads the way in scouting the market to select and scale the best new technologies for our client's mission needs as well as our own. We also continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments, consistent with Vault. In March, we announced the pending acquisition of EverWatch, aligned to our national cyber priority, which we hope to close in the coming months. We're also continuing to test the leading edge of commercial technology, making small investments to secure access to the next-generation of breakthroughs. And finally, also as of April 1, Liberty is fully integrated into Booz Allen and exceeding our expectations. This acquisition is strengthening our position in digital transformation and accelerating growth in the civil market. As you can see, our Vault growth strategy is more than aspirational words. Vault is both our future and our present and the work is underway. This is critically important. As we strive to meet our FY2025 investment thesis goal of adjusted EBITDA growth to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, supported by above market growth rates, stable margins with increased investment capacity and significant capital deployment. Shifting now to the current fiscal year 2023, we expect to continue strong growth at the top and bottom lines, while acknowledging significant volatility still exist in the environment. The U.S. economy, geopolitical conflicts, the post-pandemic work environment, upcoming midterm elections, and the federal budget beyond the current government fiscal year are all unknown. So we will need to navigate, creating headwinds and tailwinds we cannot fully predict. Our four operational priorities are aligned to the factors we can control and intended to build momentum in first half of the fiscal year to mitigate increasing volatility in the second half. First, we must hire aggressively to fully capitalize on our record backlog and robust pipeline. Second, we must continue our track record of winning work aligned to our client's highest mission priorities. Third, and of increased importance in an inflationary environment, we will continue to manage the business tightly, looking to direct our spend towards talent and strategic priorities, while delivering on our bottom line commitments. And fourth, we must maximize the value of capital deployment activities with a focus on small to midsize strategic acquisitions. When I consider what we have achieved in fiscal year 2022 and begin to set my sides over the horizon, I know our people are and will continue to be the heart of our success. As we enter this new fiscal year and execute our strategy, we focus on empowering our team to unleash our full potential and lead the way to a better future for Booz Allen, our clients, and the world and with that Lloyd over to you for a thorough discussion of fiscal year 2022, and our guidance for fiscal year 2023.\nLloyd Howell: Thank you Horacio and good morning everyone. We are pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2022. Our performance highlights our strong business fundamentals and demonstrates our ability to meet expectations and accelerate growth as we exit fiscal year 2022, with broad-based momentum across all aspects of our business. Before walking you through our results, I want to frame the conversation and the context of our investment thesis, which is centered around growing adjusted EBITDA dollars by 50% through fiscal year 2025. To achieve this objective, we defined long-term financial targets at our Investor Day that will guide us. First, 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth. Second, adjusted EBITDA margins stabilizing in the mid-10s and lastly deploying between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in capital. As you see our results exemplify our teams' disciplined and deliberate actions to execute against these long-term objectives to drive superior shareholder value in the face of operational challenges we have navigated over the past couple of years. Let me open with a few highlights from our fourth quarter result for fiscal year 2022. Revenue growth of approximately 13% compared to the prior year period represents our strongest quarter of growth since before the pandemic. Specifically, we reported growth across all of our markets with double digit growth in three of the four markets, underpinned by our fourth consecutive quarter of mid single digit headcount growth as we capitalized on strong demand signals resulting in a record fourth quarter book-to-bill of 1.66 times. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.2% a decrease of approximately 60 basis points in the quarter though, still contributing to 50 basis points of expansion for the full fiscal year. This marks an exceptional year of margin performance. We maintained strong contract execution and recognize cost savings throughout the pandemic, allowing us to make strategic investments in our business and people. Lastly, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $255 million in the quarter, an increase of 418% over the prior year. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 197% of adjusted net income, which further expands our capacity to strategically deploy capital against our long-term growth objectives. Let's now turn to our full fiscal year 2022 results. Please turn to Slide 6. At the top line revenue increased 6.4% for the full fiscal year to $8.4 billion, which includes $340 million from inorganic contributions. Revenue, excluding billable expenses also grew 6.4% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. Our organic top line growth was driven by successfully executing on the strong demand for our differentiated solutions, supported by sequential improvements in staff utilization. Let me give some color on the market level performance for the full fiscal year. Starting with defense, revenue grew by 2.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period and 0.9% for the full fiscal year. Although we still have work to do, we are pleased with our team's continued efforts to improve on growth and overall performance, contributing to a meaningful turnaround this quarter. To be specific, we had several notable wins in the fourth quarter, including our $1.5 billion eMAPS to recomplete, the largest single task order in our company's history. This win demonstrates closest to our client's mission and dedicating investments to building leading edge technologies, which is a critical enabler of our digital battlespace platform as we continue to apply our differentiated solutions in new and meaningful ways. In civil revenue grew by 33.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period and 20% for the full fiscal year. Organically revenue grew by 12.9% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full fiscal year. We are especially pleased with our double digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which highlights the growing momentum across all dimensions of the portfolio and factorising a number of exciting new work opportunities. Including Liberty's $735 billion DevSecOps win, which further deepens the mission critical work we do across the DA. In Intel, we have hit an inflection point. Revenue grew 11.1% for the quarter and 1.5% for the full fiscal year. This performance reflects the efforts made over the past several quarters to reshape parts of the portfolio to the high-end technical work we want to focus on, which is yielding positive results and contributing to exciting new wins. Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 40.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a 5.1% growth for the full fiscal year. Now onto Slide 7 for details on our demand signals, we are extremely pleased with our exceptional book-to-bill performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Book-to-bill of 1.66 times is a fourth quarter record, resulting in a full fiscal year book-to-bill of 1.36 times. Total backlog as of the end of the fiscal year grew 21.7% over the prior fiscal year, yielding our largest ever backlog of $29.2 billion. Funded backlog grew 5.7% to $3.7 billion, unfunded backlog grew 63.1% to $9.9 billion and price options grew 8.1% to $15.6 billion. These outstanding results highlight the market strong demand signals in our ability to shape, win and execute on mission critical work, align to budget priorities. With the budget in place, we are focused on working closely with our clients as they align funding outlays against their priorities. We are optimistic that we will continue to build on our strong demand results by sustaining our historical win rates for recompetes and new work while continuing to execute on our diverse pipeline of qualified opportunities. Taken together, these dynamics further cement our position as a market leader. Pivoting to headcount as of March 31, we had approximately 29,300 employees an increase of approximately 1,600 year-over-year or 5.7%. This performance exemplifies our ability to successfully execute on our core operational priority, to attract, hire and retain highly skilled technical talent required to meet growing demand in an increasingly competitive labor market. As we have discussed, accelerating headcount growth with the right skilled talent is fundamental to our long-term growth objectives. Equally important, we are actively working alongside our clients to shape the future of work and continue to evolve the way in which we and our clients do business each day to build upon the success we achieved this fiscal year. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2022 was $935 million, up 11.3% from the prior year period. As I mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% reflects an expansion of 50 basis points over the prior year. For fiscal year 2022, margins continued to benefit from the following four dynamics. First, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions. Second, prudent cost management, which benefited from lower unallowable and discretionary spend. Third, a continuation of lower than expected billable expenses and what was an anomalous year. And lastly, a return to billing for fee largely within our intel market, which contributed $24 million in fiscal year 2022. Full fiscal net income decreased 23.4% year-over-year to $467 million. Adjusted net income was $568 million, up 4.9% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 21.3% to $3.44 from $4.37 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings for share increased 7.9% to $4.21 from $3.90. Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher interest expenses over the prior year and a higher effective tax rate due to the timing of strategic tax planning initiatives in the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by a lower share count due to share repurchases made in line with our capital deployment strategy. Turning to cash. Cash from operations for fiscal year 2022 was approximate $737 million, up from $719 million in the prior fiscal year. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to focus on consistent and sustainable strong working capital management that aligns with our operational performance. We are pleased with our fourth quarter operating cash results and will continue our efforts with laser focus to optimize our already strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 were approximately $80 million, down 8% over the prior fiscal year resulting in free cash flow of approximately $657 million and a free cash flow conversion rate of 116% of adjusted net income, which supports our strong balance sheet and capital deployment priorities. Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong cash flow from operations and solid balance sheet capacity allows us to invest in the growth of our business and maximize shareholder value. We maintained a disciplined and patient approach throughout fiscal year 2022, leveraging share repurchases of $419 million. Our regular recurring dividend of approximately $209 million and capital deployed for strategic acquisitions and investments of $866 million, a record in our company\u2019s history. Our priorities around M&A along with optimizing our other levers will become an integral part of achieving our long-term growth objectives. Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15. Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance outlook is centered around growing adjusted EBITDA to $950 million and $1 billion. We expect to achieve this by delivering revenue growth between 5% and 9%, which includes 1% of inorganic contributions from Liberty and Tracepoint. Achieving adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid to high 10% range, which reflects our long-term expectations for an incremental step down in margins as unallowable spend and billable expenses continue to normalize and make strategic investments in our business to fuel growth. And generating between $850 million and $950 million in operating cash flow, which will fuel the investments we need to make in our business and the capital we seek to deploy to achieve our long-term objectives. As shown on Slide 10. This guidance does not reflect our expectations for significant cash tax payments this year, given, the volatility we expect to experience. Specifically, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes in fiscal year 2023, which includes approximately $150 million associated with Section 174. Inclusive of cash taxes, we anticipate our total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2023 will be between $300 million and $400 million. Additionally, at the bottom line, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.45 as shown on Slide 11. This range reflects strong operating results, inclusive of an inorganic contributions, incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to investments in our technology and infrastructure, a higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. This guidance is based on an assumed 131 million to 133 million weighted average shares outstanding, a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%, an interest expense in the range of $108 million to $117 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million, as we continue to meaningfully invest in our infrastructure and technology. In closing, I want to thank our entire Booz Allen team for their relentless dedication, to our mission, helping us deliver value for our clients while continuing to navigate the challenges that came our way throughout the fiscal year. We have built solid momentum across our markets. And as we enter fiscal year 2023, I am confident in the premium quality of our offerings and the strong fundamentals of our business. I believe we have the right team, vision and strategy in place to execute on our long-term objectives of delivering strong organic growth and driving superior shareholder value. With that, Laura, let\u2019s open the lines for questions.\nLaura Adams: Thank you, Lloyd. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Horacio and Lloyd. Thank you for the time. So congratulations on like the inflection in revenue growth. You guys have been talking about it for a few quarters now, what drove that? It seems like things came together all at the same time, whether it was the eMAPS contract being awarded the recompete strong civil growth, and how do we think about that 5% to 9% revenue growth for 2023 in terms of the business segments or verticals?\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Sheila, good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me maybe take a step back and frame last year into this year and beyond if that\u2019s okay and I\u2019m sure Lloyd is going to want to add to it. I think we went into last year. We\u2019re very pleased with the results obviously, but having said that, there was a fair amount of volatility in the environment that I don\u2019t think we fully captured in our guidance a year ago. And so we\u2019ve been thinking about that and making sure that, that we are doing that into this year and beyond. As you look throughout the years sequentially, we hired really well. We won a lot of work and really all of our markets began clicking on the growth posture that we expect them to have. And that needs to continue for sure into FY 2023. If you look at FY 2023 guidance, we\u2019re trying to do two things. One is we\u2019re trying to be respectful of the fact that the volatility in the environment that we saw last year will not abate this year. And so we need momentum in the first half because we expect the second half to be somewhat more volatile. To reach this 5% to 9% growth rate, we\u2019re really focused on organic growth and on organic growth across all of our markets, not one versus the other and the priorities are what I mentioned before, we need to hire, we need to win work, we need to continue to manage our cost base, so that we can be sure we have the resources to reward our talent and retain our talent. And then we really need to make smart capital deployment decisions, so that we can actually make acquisitions this year that will propel growth into the future. If I look at it all together and maybe to wrap up the \u2013 my part of the answer to this question is to say, we\u2019re on track on the multi-year investment thesis, because we are really focused on organic growth and we\u2019re able to deliver it.\nLloyd Howell: Sheila, thanks for the question. As it pertains to guidance, there are a couple dynamics we wanted to stay true on. One is that we\u2019re well positioned. We wanted to capitalize on the strong momentum and we wanted to stay true to our investment thesis. And last October what we said was we were focused on adjusted EBITDA dollars. So as we exited 2022, our range of $950 million to $1 billion says to us that we\u2019re on track. And when you look at each of the ranges for the components, you also notice that it\u2019s a little bit broader than what we historically have done. And we attempted to take into account all those elements that Horacio mentioned that in previous years, we probably didn\u2019t get quite right. We identified them, but not the impact. So the 5% to 9% in revenue from our perspective is returning to that organic growth objective being the leader in the sector that we have been in the past. The margin of mid to high 10s, as I said in my prepared comments really is a reflection of returning to a more normalized environment. Some of the dynamics with billable expense, probably shifting a bit, being more of a headwind, same with unallowable costs and the opportunity to invest in the business areas that we highlighted last October. Cash, the operations are generating solidly. So our range of $850 million to $950 million, excluding cash tax payments we feel is really going to give us the flexibility to do what we need to do. And the cash taxes are really a timing issue. I mean, this year $400 million of it is really going to be income tax expenses with a higher tax rate, effective tax rate and $150 million for that Section 174 legislation. And then lastly with ADEPS $4.15 to $4.45 also reflection of higher tax rate, a bump up in interest expense, and the diluted shares outstanding. And just as a reminder, this is why we\u2019re focused on adjusted EBITDA dollars. We recognized last year that we were going to have some things impacting the bottom line that we\u2019re going to be outside our control. So we think the guidance is on track. It\u2019s consistent with our investment thesis and we\u2019re off to a good start.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you both for that. Just one follow-up Lloyd that $400 million of cash taxes, it seems one time in nature. What do cash taxes normalize to in terms of the cash tax rate going forward?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. This year we\u2019re going to have at its headwinds. We suspect that the point in the future it\u2019ll come back to us. So we felt that bridging it for everyone today so that we don\u2019t have to revisit it in the future. You\u2019ll see sort of what the dynamic is. So a little bit of a crystal ball Sheila in terms of where it actually will normalize, but certainly the upward trend \u2013 there\u2019s an upward trend to it.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: Hey, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Gavin.\nGavin Parsons: Lloyd, if I could just stay on the cash taxes for a minute there. Could you give a little bit more detail just on what exactly is driving that given, it looks like that\u2019s almost double your GAAP tax rate. I mean, is that something that you\u2019ve underpaid over the last few years or are you prepaying for the next few years?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. You\u2019re exactly right. In the past, we underpaid and so again, back to my answer to Sheila expected to come back. So it\u2019s really a timing issue. We\u2019ve had a pretty strong strategy around taxes over the years and payments comparatively were lower in the last two years due to the implementation of our strategic tax initiatives. So we do expect normalization as the benefits from our ongoing initiatives are recognized.\nGavin Parsons: Got it. And I know you said it's a bit of a crystal ball, but is this the cumulative amount of underpayment? Or do you think you still have some to go in the future?\nLloyd Howell: Probably some more to go in the future, but it is what it is right now.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then maybe on headcount growth. I know 4Q is not typically the strongest hiring quarter, but maybe if you could discuss why headcount didn't grow sequentially in the quarter and what you're assuming for headcount growth in fiscal 2023?\nHoracio Rozanski: Why don't I start? I mean, obviously, this is our top operational priorities to attract and retain the right people in the business. And we feel we're doing very well against that if I'm not mistaken, we're at 5.7% over \u2013 year-over-year headcount growth for FY 2022. We always started to get the mid-single-digit headcount growth and to meet our organic growth requirements. We'll do the same thing in 2023. The Q4 numbers, as you pointed out, first of all, that's not typically our strongest hiring quarter. But the other thing is, as we continue to control costs and make sure that we're doing the right thing there, there's \u2013 what you don't see in the numbers is a shift from non-billable staff to billable staff that happened throughout the quarter as we hire more in one area and when we manage down some costs in the other area.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie Dipalma: Good. Good morning, Horacio, Lloyd, Laura and Megan. And congrats, Kristine, on your appointment.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you. Thank you for that. We're very excited about that.\nLouie Dipalma: For the eMAPS recompete, is the ceiling double the previous ceiling? And was the original contract expected to end in 2023?\nHoracio Rozanski: The ceiling is expanding greatly. I haven't done the math precisely, but I think there's at least $0.5 billion of new ceiling in there as the mission, the scope continues to expand and frankly, the impact of our work makes our clients need and want more, as you know, we were expecting this to be done earlier in the year, but it's we're poised to ramp up there. I think it underlies why we are confident the growth of our defense business this year. And again, it is obviously financially important, but it's also strategically important because this is the type of work we want to do. At the center of the mission, driving both mission priorities and technology into core key missions that are going to need and are going to be transformed by it. And I think we've pointed out this may be the largest single task order in the history of Booz Allen, so we're excited about that.\nLouie Dipalma: Great, Horacio. And it seems that you're investing significantly in this area. You established the partnerships with Synthetaic and Reveal. And following this successful renewal, I was wondering how are your other data analytics programs progressing such as during your Analyst Day you highlighted project Rainmaker with the Army, and you've also highlighted your Advana platform that you co-developed with the DoD. I was wondering broadly how all of your initiatives with AI are progressing. Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you for remembering what we talked about at Investor Day with such clarity, Louie. Sometimes we \u2013 it's hard to tell if people are going to remember everything we talk about, so I'm really appreciative of your attention to all of this. I think this all falls into the rubric, generally speaking, of digital battle space, and the work that we are doing to knit all of these legacy systems and new technologies in the department to give the warfighter a decision advantage. And that's Advana is more of a headquarters play on that, Rainmakers, data fabric that is supposed to go headquarters to the edge. A lot of the work that we're doing in digital battle space is around building the IP and IC that would allow us to have a unique position in this notion of creating the data fabric that connects all of the systems and gives the warfighter what they need from a data perspective. And then on top of that, we want to make sure that we're building the AI tools, resources, algorithms to make that information valuable real-time. A couple of the small investments that you described are all under the rubric of the work that we're doing in the CTO office to make sure that we're really scanning what's happening in the commercial markets, what are the new technologies, the new thinking and how do we make sure that DoD has access to that real-time. So we're talking about one a company that does synthetic data because, as you know, you need that to build these models and to train them all faster algorithm compression so that we can actually push that to the edge and the like. So we're obviously very bullish on that. This is one of the areas we're talking about for VoLT for hyper growth that will fuel not just 2023 but 2024, 2025 and well beyond.\nLouie Dipalma: Sounds good. Thanks, Horacio.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMatt Akers: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess a couple more on the revenue kind of walk year-over-year. Is it possible to size how big the Middle East, South Africa business was? And then I guess for EverWatch, can you say how big that was? And just to verify, you're not including that in the guidance yet? Or are you?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I'll start. I mean on the Middle East business, it's small. It's not going to shake up the financials in any kind of way. I'll never watch. I really can't give you much more today until we close and we remain confident that we're going to get there. It's not included in the guidance that I provided earlier.\nLouie Dipalma: Got it. Okay. And then I guess just on debt interest up a little bit in fiscal 2023. You guys have a little bit of variable rate debt. Just is there a chance a change in your sort of thoughts on fixed versus variable rates debt or maybe hedging going forward given some of the moves in interest rates here that we're seeing.\nLloyd Howell: Yes. No, it's top of mind for sure. Today, it's 67%, 33%, fixed to floating. We're looking at it in light of interest rate movements and it will also be part of how we think about our future financing certainly in the near and the midterm.\nLouie Dipalma: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you so much. So book-to-bill was, if you take out the acquired backlog looks like it was about one-four. Could you give us some color on the demand trends you're seeing now, and also your funded book-to-bill was pretty anemic, not quite as bad as CACI\u2019s and any trends you're seeing are things starting to continuing to pick up as we go into the current quarter?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, I'll certainly start, Cai. As we've been saying for quite some time, even though I may not have felt like it previously, the overall market and the demand signals have been pretty solid. I think we did see some program slippage. I think others talked about that too. But with the budget in place, we're seeing a pretty robust RFP season. As you can see in our disclosure, our win rates for recompetes still holding at 90% for new work in the low 60s, our dialogues with our clients are both existing tasking and future tasking is also pretty robust. And you also saw a pickup in price options, which we see as a leading indicator to our client satisfaction with Booz Allen, but also their confidence about what they'd like to do going forward. Then lastly, the pipeline is extremely robust, backlogs up 22% year-over-year. And so we feel good about all of that. In terms of the mix of funded and unfunded, over the years that sort of ebbs and flows and it's really a function of timing. And as clients sort of think about their priorities and maybe shift a little bit, average contract side tends to be about five years. And so we've got large \u2013 increasingly larger and larger technical work. And so we're going to see some of that bump around, but I think you nailed it in you're opening question. We really internally look at the trailing 12 months and if it's north of 1.2, we're feeling pretty good and to be at close to 1.4 times that just further tells us we've got strong demand signals.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. If I can build in just in a couple directions so what Lloyd is saying, as we've always \u2013 we've been saying for a while, we're not demand constrained. We appreciate the volatility in the environment, which is why we're really focused on the first half of this year on building momentum. And from a growth perspective, I was reflecting the other day on the fact that we are fast approaching 30,000 people, fast approaching $30 billion in backlog so the number 30 is pretend something good for us in the long. And it speaks to the growth that we both have been able to generate, and we aspire to create under Vault. And then my prepared remarks, I try to take you through some of the leadership changes, organizational priorities and investments that we're making to ensure that this acceleration of organic growth that we're talking about in 2023 continues into 2024 and 2025.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much. So turning the headcount, I mean, your head count was up, but how far was it up organically and it was down sequentially. So are you having any trouble hiring? And so I mean, you said you're not demand constrained, but are you supply constrained?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I think we have consistently said it's a tight labor market that remains true today and into the future. We thought 2.8 organic growth in our headcount. And we're very pleased with that, just given the tightness in the market. As Horacio said, we did have some staff departures, but actually that was a part of deliberate cost synergies that also sort of nudged it down sequentially. So what are we doing about it, got a very aggressive referral program. We're increasingly reaching out to our traditional and non-traditional sources. The overall pipeline of candidates has been growing and because of our culture and because of the recognition we've gotten widely, we are seen as an employer of choice. So we remain optimistic that back to targeting mid single-digits this fiscal year that we're going to get increasingly closer to that. But it still remains a very tight labor market.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. Cai, as you know, this topic of talent is near and dear to my heart, it has always been. I would say, there's three things, we're laser focused on. The first one, as Lloyd said, we're controlling costs in large to make sure that we have the resources to reward our people, to retain our people to compensate in a very tight labor market. Two, we are continuing to invest in our environment and in our culture, the people are now able to return to the office in a much more flexible way. We're hearing really good things about that. And again, the culture of Booz Allen has always been a differentiator. And three, ultimately, the work that we are doing keeps people here, wants people to come here. I open the call today, talking a little bit about the work that we're doing to support the U.S. government on what's happening in Ukraine. That's the type of work that makes the people working on it proud, but it makes us proud and it makes people want to come to Booz Allen to be part of those missions.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Canfield with Barclays. Your line is open.\nColin Canfield: Hey, good morning. Can you just discuss your organic guidance in the context of the multi-year growth target cadence? You said that you're on track for your investment objective, but you're underperforming the mid of the previous organic growth target of 6.5%. Then as we think out, kind of on a multiyear period, what sort of hiring do you need to accelerate or what sort of hiring do you need to see to accelerate above this year's organic guide? Thanks.\nLloyd Howell: Yes, we're looking at a 4% to 8% range organically, the midpoint of which is significantly north of our exit and 2022. And to Cai's question, if we're able to hit mid single-digits in terms of bringing on the talent. We think the conversion of our very strong backlog puts us solidly in that space. So momentum is building, we feel good about the demand signals as I mentioned earlier. We're going to continue to make recruiting and onboarding our top operational priority which will put us, we believe in those ranges.\nColin Canfield: Got it. And then with respect to the 1% inorganic growth contribution this year, can you just talk a little bit about the valuation framework that you're looking at in terms of your capital's deployment strategy? Is there a good payback period to think about or if you think about out your Investor Day targets, kind of what's the updated inorganic placeholder we should be considering for adjust EBITDA?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, the 1% is a reflection of our past commentary on M&A. Liberty has been fully integrated as of April as well as Tracepoint. So this year we saw about $340 million of contribution from those guys to our overall performance. So on a go-forward basis we're obviously looking at the financials, but our priority around M&A is strategically going to accelerate our growth. We have strong cultural alignment and then do the financials make sense. And in the case of Liberty and Tracepoint, both of those were great case studies as to how we get there or where we want to be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, good morning. Thanks very much.\nLloyd Howell: Good morning,\nSeth Seifman: Good morning, Lloyd, can we dig into this tax issue a little bit more because when I look in the 10-K it doesn't look like the cash tax payments have been lagging significantly behind the GAAP. And then if I think about this year's cash tax payment, let's put aside the R&D issue, which nobody knows if that's going to stick around or not, but even putting that aside, it's like a 50% tax rate. And so when you think about like, where should it go going forward? And it seems like maybe, it's still going to be elevated or moving north or something like that, I guess. Can you help us level set there a little bit more?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, you know, the timing of our past tax strategies has put us in the 22% to 24% range. Going forward, we expect it to be at the upper end of that 24%. So in the past years, we were successful in having \u2013 managing our taxes for the long term and able to drive the tax rate down, obviously pending legislation and things of that sort, we're seeing it going in the other direction. So I take push back a little bit on the 50%. The effective tax rate is more in that 23% to 25%, but we've got these additional dynamics as it pertains to the legislation that bumps it up.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Just to understand the tax rate, like if we cash taxes would be $400 million, if not \u2013 let's put aside the R&D issues, cash taxes would be $400 million without that?\nLloyd Howell: Correct, correct.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Yeah. Okay. And pretax income was something like $750 million or so?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, we've got in terms of our operating cash we've got $850 million to $950 million which back to my prepared remarks, really to us indicates that the operations are solidly generating what we would expect.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. And so if we think to the out years, should we think if the GAAP tax rate is 24% that your cash taxes should be in line and there would be really no changes on the \u2013 or no inflows or outflow showing on the cash flow statement or the cash taxes might be different.\nLloyd Howell: Yeah. I think you got it right. I mean, that is true. But we're also going to see some things come back to us given our strategies that we've had. So we really see that the timing of payments is really the dynamic that we're grappling with. And we wanted to disclose that to you also, that you you're able to sort of model it and understand it.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Horacio for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you very much. Thank you all for your questions this morning and for joining us. I hope in the last hour we gave you the additional insight you need to be able to see how well we're doing both delivering financially and transforming strategically under vault. We are undergoing a lot of plan change and I am very proud of that. But maybe in closing, the important thing is also to talk about what doesn't change. And the top thing that does not change at Booz Allen is our purpose and our values. We're now almost 30,000 strong and the people of Booz Allen and are as committed as always to empowering each other and everybody around us to change the world, and to live our values out loud. And that makes being recognized by Forbes as number three, among the Top 500 best employers for diversity, particularly meaningful. The diversity of our workforce, it reflects our values, and it enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. I believe that diversity of perspectives, ideas, and experiences are key to achieving the visions that Lloyd and I described for you today. And I'm extremely optimistic about the future of Booz Allen. And in large part, because I get to experience the passion and the quality of our people first-hand each and every day, so once again, thank you for being with us today and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment this morning to acknowledge the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine, and share how Booz Allen is responding. As millions of people fleet a country or are displaced, the need for humanitarian assistance and protection grows more acute every day. In response, we committed to provide aid through an employee giving campaign and company match. Our employees' engagement in the campaign has been tremendous, and I am grateful for their generosity and compassion. From a mission perspective, our teams in Europe and the U.S. are supporting our clients across a broad range of areas. They are working around the clock to deliver critical capabilities and insights to our clients, true to our purpose. They are working relentlessly to change the world. I'm thankful for their dedication, the extraordinary power of their work, and the difference they're making to our teams supporting these missions. On behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you. Thank you for the work you're doing and the sacrifices you are making to serve our clients and the nation. It's an honor to call you our colleagues. Today, and always, our thoughts remain with the Ukrainian people, and we hope for a peaceful and just resolution to the conflict soon. This morning, Lloyd and I are pleased to report our results for fiscal year 2022. In a year marked by exceptional volatility, Booz Allen committed to a new growth strategy and multiyear financials, invested in our future and managed the business with precision and skill. I am extremely proud of the work and the impact our leaders and our entire team have made. Their talent and dedication underpin the results we shared with you today. For the full fiscal year, bottom line results were excellent. Revenue growth was also solid, but below our expectations set a year ago. We remain steadfast to our operational priorities throughout the year, culminating in growth across all markets in both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. We adeptly controlled costs to deliver on both our bottom line commitments and invested in our future and our people. One year into our multiyear investment thesis, we have made strong strategic progress and are on track to deliver against our goals. Over the next few moments, I will set the strategic context for our financial performance, and then Lloyd will take you through FY 2022 results and FY 2023 guidance in depth. As we shared with you on Investor Day, Booz Allen believes that the rapidly evolving challenges confronting our nation will accelerate the pace of change in our government's missions and use of technology. 5 to 10 years from now, technologies from 5G to AI and from blockchain to Quantum will be ubiquitous across a range of missions. And because we have been preparing for this for over a decade, we believe Booz Allen holds a strategic first-mover advantage. We have the opportunity to help our clients through their transformation to digital missions, and we are poised to convert this extraordinary opportunity into growth that creates long-term shareholder value. At Investor Day, we introduced VoLT, our growth strategy. VoLT reflects our ambitions and guides us as we build the Booz Allen of the future. In our next era, we will scale Booz Allen to an even greater level of industry leadership. We will be the premier partner to the federal government, continuously bringing innovation to national priority missions, faster than the pace of change. VoLT stands for velocity, leadership and technology. These three words are the fundamental principles for how we are transforming to achieve our aspirations. We advanced with velocity, investing ahead of emerging technology waves and expanding our market positions through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We redefine leadership, investing in people with the right expertise to lead and scale hyper growth businesses at the mission technology intersection. And we apply next generation technology, creating differentiated intellectual capital and property to address our clients' needs at/or ahead of mission demands. Today, I am excited to tell you that VoLT is underway. As we operationalize the strategy, two success factors are clear. One, we need to make decisions faster to accelerate our growth. Two, our transformation will require relentless focus and seamless integration. This is why at the outset, we are taking an important step to address these needs. I'm excited to announce that we have named Executive Vice President and Civil Sector President, Kristine Martin Anderson as Booz Allen's Chief Operating Officer. This appointment by the Board of Directors is effective June 1. Kristine is a proven leader who perceives opportunities amid challenges. In leading both our health team and our civil market, she has demonstrated the ability to grow and manage technology first businesses, develop talented leaders, help senior clients transform and integrate acquisitions. All while consistently delivering strong financial results. As our COO, Kristine will play a major role in Vault, taking primary responsibility for accelerating firm wide operational performance and the transformation of our business model, in collaboration with leaders from across the firm. I've had the personal pleasure of working with Kristine for many years. I look forward to partnering with her more closely in her new role for years to come. As a result of Kristine's changing role, Rich Crowe, currently Chief Growth Officer has been named Civil Sector President. Rich is a seasoned and innovative business leader who previously led and scaled the health account to its market leading position. An accomplished leader in his own right, Rich is also an indication of the depth of talent we are lucky to have in our firm. I hope you'll have a chance to meet Kristine and Rich at future events. Now allow me to share additional details on the progress we are making on Vault. Foundational to our strategy is building businesses at the intersection of mission and technology. As of April 1, we formally launched two operational business units, aligned to mission areas we believe are critical to our nation and prime for hyper growth. We have nested digital battle space inside our global defense sector. This is where we are innovating to help the Department of Defense securely drive information to the edge, to create decision advantage. By applying AI, machine learning, 5G and other emerging technologies to the joint warfighting mission, the women and men who defend our country will have superior situational awareness to make better decisions faster. National cyber, a core element of our national security sector builds on our leading position in the intelligence community. We have delivered innovative cyber trade-craft to these clients for decades and recognized that the cyber domain is horizontal and not vertical. Therefore, we are now extending and expanding our reach into scalable cyber solutions for a broader set of clients across the Department of Defense and civilian agencies. Our focus is on cyber network operations and protecting critical infrastructure. With the organizational launch of these two mission-centric businesses, we now have dedicated leaders and technical talent aligned to drive the team forward and deliver on a clear set of objectives. We have also taken the time to reimagine our innovation agenda. As of April 1, we integrated our IT infrastructure and innovation functions into a newly created Chief Technology Office led by Susan Penfield. This organization leads the way in scouting the market to select and scale the best new technologies for our client's mission needs as well as our own. We also continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments, consistent with Vault. In March, we announced the pending acquisition of EverWatch, aligned to our national cyber priority, which we hope to close in the coming months. We're also continuing to test the leading edge of commercial technology, making small investments to secure access to the next-generation of breakthroughs. And finally, also as of April 1, Liberty is fully integrated into Booz Allen and exceeding our expectations. This acquisition is strengthening our position in digital transformation and accelerating growth in the civil market. As you can see, our Vault growth strategy is more than aspirational words. Vault is both our future and our present and the work is underway. This is critically important. As we strive to meet our FY2025 investment thesis goal of adjusted EBITDA growth to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, supported by above market growth rates, stable margins with increased investment capacity and significant capital deployment. Shifting now to the current fiscal year 2023, we expect to continue strong growth at the top and bottom lines, while acknowledging significant volatility still exist in the environment. The U.S. economy, geopolitical conflicts, the post-pandemic work environment, upcoming midterm elections, and the federal budget beyond the current government fiscal year are all unknown. So we will need to navigate, creating headwinds and tailwinds we cannot fully predict. Our four operational priorities are aligned to the factors we can control and intended to build momentum in first half of the fiscal year to mitigate increasing volatility in the second half. First, we must hire aggressively to fully capitalize on our record backlog and robust pipeline. Second, we must continue our track record of winning work aligned to our client's highest mission priorities. Third, and of increased importance in an inflationary environment, we will continue to manage the business tightly, looking to direct our spend towards talent and strategic priorities, while delivering on our bottom line commitments. And fourth, we must maximize the value of capital deployment activities with a focus on small to midsize strategic acquisitions. When I consider what we have achieved in fiscal year 2022 and begin to set my sides over the horizon, I know our people are and will continue to be the heart of our success. As we enter this new fiscal year and execute our strategy, we focus on empowering our team to unleash our full potential and lead the way to a better future for Booz Allen, our clients, and the world and with that Lloyd over to you for a thorough discussion of fiscal year 2022, and our guidance for fiscal year 2023. Hey, Sheila, good morning. Thanks for the question. Let me maybe take a step back and frame last year into this year and beyond if that's okay and I'm sure Lloyd is going to want to add to it. I think we went into last year. We're very pleased with the results obviously, but having said that, there was a fair amount of volatility in the environment that I don't think we fully captured in our guidance a year ago. And so we've been thinking about that and making sure that, that we are doing that into this year and beyond. As you look throughout the years sequentially, we hired really well. We won a lot of work and really all of our markets began clicking on the growth posture that we expect them to have. And that needs to continue for sure into FY 2023. If you look at FY 2023 guidance, we're trying to do two things. One is we're trying to be respectful of the fact that the volatility in the environment that we saw last year will not abate this year. And so we need momentum in the first half because we expect the second half to be somewhat more volatile. To reach this 5% to 9% growth rate, we're really focused on organic growth and on organic growth across all of our markets, not one versus the other and the priorities are what I mentioned before, we need to hire, we need to win work, we need to continue to manage our cost base, so that we can be sure we have the resources to reward our talent and retain our talent. And then we really need to make smart capital deployment decisions, so that we can actually make acquisitions this year that will propel growth into the future. If I look at it all together and maybe to wrap up the \u2013 my part of the answer to this question is to say, we're on track on the multi-year investment thesis, because we are really focused on organic growth and we're able to deliver it. Good morning, Gavin. Why don't I start? I mean, obviously, this is our top operational priorities to attract and retain the right people in the business. And we feel we're doing very well against that if I'm not mistaken, we're at 5.7% over \u2013 year-over-year headcount growth for FY 2022. We always started to get the mid-single-digit headcount growth and to meet our organic growth requirements. We'll do the same thing in 2023. The Q4 numbers, as you pointed out, first of all, that's not typically our strongest hiring quarter. But the other thing is, as we continue to control costs and make sure that we're doing the right thing there, there's \u2013 what you don't see in the numbers is a shift from non-billable staff to billable staff that happened throughout the quarter as we hire more in one area and when we manage down some costs in the other area. Thank you. Thank you for that. We're very excited about that. The ceiling is expanding greatly. I haven't done the math precisely, but I think there's at least $0.5 billion of new ceiling in there as the mission, the scope continues to expand and frankly, the impact of our work makes our clients need and want more, as you know, we were expecting this to be done earlier in the year, but it's we're poised to ramp up there. I think it underlies why we are confident the growth of our defense business this year. And again, it is obviously financially important, but it's also strategically important because this is the type of work we want to do. At the center of the mission, driving both mission priorities and technology into core key missions that are going to need and are going to be transformed by it. And I think we've pointed out this may be the largest single task order in the history of Booz Allen, so we're excited about that. Thank you for remembering what we talked about at Investor Day with such clarity, Louie. Sometimes we \u2013 it's hard to tell if people are going to remember everything we talk about, so I'm really appreciative of your attention to all of this. I think this all falls into the rubric, generally speaking, of digital battle space, and the work that we are doing to knit all of these legacy systems and new technologies in the department to give the warfighter a decision advantage. And that's Advana is more of a headquarters play on that, Rainmakers, data fabric that is supposed to go headquarters to the edge. A lot of the work that we're doing in digital battle space is around building the IP and IC that would allow us to have a unique position in this notion of creating the data fabric that connects all of the systems and gives the warfighter what they need from a data perspective. And then on top of that, we want to make sure that we're building the AI tools, resources, algorithms to make that information valuable real-time. A couple of the small investments that you described are all under the rubric of the work that we're doing in the CTO office to make sure that we're really scanning what's happening in the commercial markets, what are the new technologies, the new thinking and how do we make sure that DoD has access to that real-time. So we're talking about one a company that does synthetic data because, as you know, you need that to build these models and to train them all faster algorithm compression so that we can actually push that to the edge and the like. So we're obviously very bullish on that. This is one of the areas we're talking about for VoLT for hyper growth that will fuel not just 2023 but 2024, 2025 and well beyond. Thank you. Yes. If I can build in just in a couple directions so what Lloyd is saying, as we've always \u2013 we've been saying for a while, we're not demand constrained. We appreciate the volatility in the environment, which is why we're really focused on the first half of this year on building momentum. And from a growth perspective, I was reflecting the other day on the fact that we are fast approaching 30,000 people, fast approaching $30 billion in backlog so the number 30 is pretend something good for us in the long. And it speaks to the growth that we both have been able to generate, and we aspire to create under Vault. And then my prepared remarks, I try to take you through some of the leadership changes, organizational priorities and investments that we're making to ensure that this acceleration of organic growth that we're talking about in 2023 continues into 2024 and 2025. Yes. Cai, as you know, this topic of talent is near and dear to my heart, it has always been. I would say, there's three things, we're laser focused on. The first one, as Lloyd said, we're controlling costs in large to make sure that we have the resources to reward our people, to retain our people to compensate in a very tight labor market. Two, we are continuing to invest in our environment and in our culture, the people are now able to return to the office in a much more flexible way. We're hearing really good things about that. And again, the culture of Booz Allen has always been a differentiator. And three, ultimately, the work that we are doing keeps people here, wants people to come here. I open the call today, talking a little bit about the work that we're doing to support the U.S. government on what's happening in Ukraine. That's the type of work that makes the people working on it proud, but it makes us proud and it makes people want to come to Booz Allen to be part of those missions. Thank you very much. Thank you all for your questions this morning and for joining us. I hope in the last hour we gave you the additional insight you need to be able to see how well we're doing both delivering financially and transforming strategically under vault. We are undergoing a lot of plan change and I am very proud of that. But maybe in closing, the important thing is also to talk about what doesn't change. And the top thing that does not change at Booz Allen is our purpose and our values. We're now almost 30,000 strong and the people of Booz Allen and are as committed as always to empowering each other and everybody around us to change the world, and to live our values out loud. And that makes being recognized by Forbes as number three, among the Top 500 best employers for diversity, particularly meaningful. The diversity of our workforce, it reflects our values, and it enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. I believe that diversity of perspectives, ideas, and experiences are key to achieving the visions that Lloyd and I described for you today. And I'm extremely optimistic about the future of Booz Allen. And in large part, because I get to experience the passion and the quality of our people first-hand each and every day, so once again, thank you for being with us today and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thank you Horacio and good morning everyone. We are pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2022. Our performance highlights our strong business fundamentals and demonstrates our ability to meet expectations and accelerate growth as we exit fiscal year 2022, with broad-based momentum across all aspects of our business. Before walking you through our results, I want to frame the conversation and the context of our investment thesis, which is centered around growing adjusted EBITDA dollars by 50% through fiscal year 2025. To achieve this objective, we defined long-term financial targets at our Investor Day that will guide us. First, 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth. Second, adjusted EBITDA margins stabilizing in the mid-10s and lastly deploying between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in capital. As you see our results exemplify our teams' disciplined and deliberate actions to execute against these long-term objectives to drive superior shareholder value in the face of operational challenges we have navigated over the past couple of years. Let me open with a few highlights from our fourth quarter result for fiscal year 2022. Revenue growth of approximately 13% compared to the prior year period represents our strongest quarter of growth since before the pandemic. Specifically, we reported growth across all of our markets with double digit growth in three of the four markets, underpinned by our fourth consecutive quarter of mid single digit headcount growth as we capitalized on strong demand signals resulting in a record fourth quarter book-to-bill of 1.66 times. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.2% a decrease of approximately 60 basis points in the quarter though, still contributing to 50 basis points of expansion for the full fiscal year. This marks an exceptional year of margin performance. We maintained strong contract execution and recognize cost savings throughout the pandemic, allowing us to make strategic investments in our business and people. Lastly, we delivered strong operating cash flow of $255 million in the quarter, an increase of 418% over the prior year. This resulted in a free cash flow conversion of 197% of adjusted net income, which further expands our capacity to strategically deploy capital against our long-term growth objectives. Let's now turn to our full fiscal year 2022 results. Please turn to Slide 6. At the top line revenue increased 6.4% for the full fiscal year to $8.4 billion, which includes $340 million from inorganic contributions. Revenue, excluding billable expenses also grew 6.4% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. Our organic top line growth was driven by successfully executing on the strong demand for our differentiated solutions, supported by sequential improvements in staff utilization. Let me give some color on the market level performance for the full fiscal year. Starting with defense, revenue grew by 2.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period and 0.9% for the full fiscal year. Although we still have work to do, we are pleased with our team's continued efforts to improve on growth and overall performance, contributing to a meaningful turnaround this quarter. To be specific, we had several notable wins in the fourth quarter, including our $1.5 billion eMAPS to recomplete, the largest single task order in our company's history. This win demonstrates closest to our client's mission and dedicating investments to building leading edge technologies, which is a critical enabler of our digital battlespace platform as we continue to apply our differentiated solutions in new and meaningful ways. In civil revenue grew by 33.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period and 20% for the full fiscal year. Organically revenue grew by 12.9% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full fiscal year. We are especially pleased with our double digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which highlights the growing momentum across all dimensions of the portfolio and factorising a number of exciting new work opportunities. Including Liberty's $735 billion DevSecOps win, which further deepens the mission critical work we do across the DA. In Intel, we have hit an inflection point. Revenue grew 11.1% for the quarter and 1.5% for the full fiscal year. This performance reflects the efforts made over the past several quarters to reshape parts of the portfolio to the high-end technical work we want to focus on, which is yielding positive results and contributing to exciting new wins. Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 40.1% for the quarter compared to the prior year period, which resulted in a 5.1% growth for the full fiscal year. Now onto Slide 7 for details on our demand signals, we are extremely pleased with our exceptional book-to-bill performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year. Book-to-bill of 1.66 times is a fourth quarter record, resulting in a full fiscal year book-to-bill of 1.36 times. Total backlog as of the end of the fiscal year grew 21.7% over the prior fiscal year, yielding our largest ever backlog of $29.2 billion. Funded backlog grew 5.7% to $3.7 billion, unfunded backlog grew 63.1% to $9.9 billion and price options grew 8.1% to $15.6 billion. These outstanding results highlight the market strong demand signals in our ability to shape, win and execute on mission critical work, align to budget priorities. With the budget in place, we are focused on working closely with our clients as they align funding outlays against their priorities. We are optimistic that we will continue to build on our strong demand results by sustaining our historical win rates for recompetes and new work while continuing to execute on our diverse pipeline of qualified opportunities. Taken together, these dynamics further cement our position as a market leader. Pivoting to headcount as of March 31, we had approximately 29,300 employees an increase of approximately 1,600 year-over-year or 5.7%. This performance exemplifies our ability to successfully execute on our core operational priority, to attract, hire and retain highly skilled technical talent required to meet growing demand in an increasingly competitive labor market. As we have discussed, accelerating headcount growth with the right skilled talent is fundamental to our long-term growth objectives. Equally important, we are actively working alongside our clients to shape the future of work and continue to evolve the way in which we and our clients do business each day to build upon the success we achieved this fiscal year. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for fiscal year 2022 was $935 million, up 11.3% from the prior year period. As I mentioned, our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% reflects an expansion of 50 basis points over the prior year. For fiscal year 2022, margins continued to benefit from the following four dynamics. First, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions. Second, prudent cost management, which benefited from lower unallowable and discretionary spend. Third, a continuation of lower than expected billable expenses and what was an anomalous year. And lastly, a return to billing for fee largely within our intel market, which contributed $24 million in fiscal year 2022. Full fiscal net income decreased 23.4% year-over-year to $467 million. Adjusted net income was $568 million, up 4.9% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 21.3% to $3.44 from $4.37 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings for share increased 7.9% to $4.21 from $3.90. Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher interest expenses over the prior year and a higher effective tax rate due to the timing of strategic tax planning initiatives in the prior fiscal year. These increases were partially offset by a lower share count due to share repurchases made in line with our capital deployment strategy. Turning to cash. Cash from operations for fiscal year 2022 was approximate $737 million, up from $719 million in the prior fiscal year. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to focus on consistent and sustainable strong working capital management that aligns with our operational performance. We are pleased with our fourth quarter operating cash results and will continue our efforts with laser focus to optimize our already strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2022 were approximately $80 million, down 8% over the prior fiscal year resulting in free cash flow of approximately $657 million and a free cash flow conversion rate of 116% of adjusted net income, which supports our strong balance sheet and capital deployment priorities. Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong cash flow from operations and solid balance sheet capacity allows us to invest in the growth of our business and maximize shareholder value. We maintained a disciplined and patient approach throughout fiscal year 2022, leveraging share repurchases of $419 million. Our regular recurring dividend of approximately $209 million and capital deployed for strategic acquisitions and investments of $866 million, a record in our company's history. Our priorities around M&A along with optimizing our other levers will become an integral part of achieving our long-term growth objectives. Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share payable on June 30 to stockholders of record on June 15. Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. For fiscal year 2023, our guidance outlook is centered around growing adjusted EBITDA to $950 million and $1 billion. We expect to achieve this by delivering revenue growth between 5% and 9%, which includes 1% of inorganic contributions from Liberty and Tracepoint. Achieving adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid to high 10% range, which reflects our long-term expectations for an incremental step down in margins as unallowable spend and billable expenses continue to normalize and make strategic investments in our business to fuel growth. And generating between $850 million and $950 million in operating cash flow, which will fuel the investments we need to make in our business and the capital we seek to deploy to achieve our long-term objectives. As shown on Slide 10. This guidance does not reflect our expectations for significant cash tax payments this year, given, the volatility we expect to experience. Specifically, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes in fiscal year 2023, which includes approximately $150 million associated with Section 174. Inclusive of cash taxes, we anticipate our total operating cash flow for fiscal year 2023 will be between $300 million and $400 million. Additionally, at the bottom line, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.45 as shown on Slide 11. This range reflects strong operating results, inclusive of an inorganic contributions, incremental depreciation and amortization expense related to investments in our technology and infrastructure, a higher interest expense and a higher effective tax rate. This guidance is based on an assumed 131 million to 133 million weighted average shares outstanding, a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%, an interest expense in the range of $108 million to $117 million. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million, as we continue to meaningfully invest in our infrastructure and technology. In closing, I want to thank our entire Booz Allen team for their relentless dedication, to our mission, helping us deliver value for our clients while continuing to navigate the challenges that came our way throughout the fiscal year. We have built solid momentum across our markets. And as we enter fiscal year 2023, I am confident in the premium quality of our offerings and the strong fundamentals of our business. I believe we have the right team, vision and strategy in place to execute on our long-term objectives of delivering strong organic growth and driving superior shareholder value. With that, Laura, let's open the lines for questions. Sheila, thanks for the question. As it pertains to guidance, there are a couple dynamics we wanted to stay true on. One is that we're well positioned. We wanted to capitalize on the strong momentum and we wanted to stay true to our investment thesis. And last October what we said was we were focused on adjusted EBITDA dollars. So as we exited 2022, our range of $950 million to $1 billion says to us that we're on track. And when you look at each of the ranges for the components, you also notice that it's a little bit broader than what we historically have done. And we attempted to take into account all those elements that Horacio mentioned that in previous years, we probably didn't get quite right. We identified them, but not the impact. So the 5% to 9% in revenue from our perspective is returning to that organic growth objective being the leader in the sector that we have been in the past. The margin of mid to high 10s, as I said in my prepared comments really is a reflection of returning to a more normalized environment. Some of the dynamics with billable expense, probably shifting a bit, being more of a headwind, same with unallowable costs and the opportunity to invest in the business areas that we highlighted last October. Cash, the operations are generating solidly. So our range of $850 million to $950 million, excluding cash tax payments we feel is really going to give us the flexibility to do what we need to do. And the cash taxes are really a timing issue. I mean, this year $400 million of it is really going to be income tax expenses with a higher tax rate, effective tax rate and $150 million for that Section 174 legislation. And then lastly with ADEPS $4.15 to $4.45 also reflection of higher tax rate, a bump up in interest expense, and the diluted shares outstanding. And just as a reminder, this is why we're focused on adjusted EBITDA dollars. We recognized last year that we were going to have some things impacting the bottom line that we're going to be outside our control. So we think the guidance is on track. It's consistent with our investment thesis and we're off to a good start. Yes. This year we're going to have at its headwinds. We suspect that the point in the future it'll come back to us. So we felt that bridging it for everyone today so that we don't have to revisit it in the future. You'll see sort of what the dynamic is. So a little bit of a crystal ball Sheila in terms of where it actually will normalize, but certainly the upward trend \u2013 there's an upward trend to it. Yes. You're exactly right. In the past, we underpaid and so again, back to my answer to Sheila expected to come back. So it's really a timing issue. We've had a pretty strong strategy around taxes over the years and payments comparatively were lower in the last two years due to the implementation of our strategic tax initiatives. So we do expect normalization as the benefits from our ongoing initiatives are recognized. Probably some more to go in the future, but it is what it is right now. Yes. I'll start. I mean on the Middle East business, it's small. It's not going to shake up the financials in any kind of way. I'll never watch. I really can't give you much more today until we close and we remain confident that we're going to get there. It's not included in the guidance that I provided earlier. Yes. No, it's top of mind for sure. Today, it's 67%, 33%, fixed to floating. We're looking at it in light of interest rate movements and it will also be part of how we think about our future financing certainly in the near and the midterm. Yes, I'll certainly start, Cai. As we've been saying for quite some time, even though I may not have felt like it previously, the overall market and the demand signals have been pretty solid. I think we did see some program slippage. I think others talked about that too. But with the budget in place, we're seeing a pretty robust RFP season. As you can see in our disclosure, our win rates for recompetes still holding at 90% for new work in the low 60s, our dialogues with our clients are both existing tasking and future tasking is also pretty robust. And you also saw a pickup in price options, which we see as a leading indicator to our client satisfaction with Booz Allen, but also their confidence about what they'd like to do going forward. Then lastly, the pipeline is extremely robust, backlogs up 22% year-over-year. And so we feel good about all of that. In terms of the mix of funded and unfunded, over the years that sort of ebbs and flows and it's really a function of timing. And as clients sort of think about their priorities and maybe shift a little bit, average contract side tends to be about five years. And so we've got large \u2013 increasingly larger and larger technical work. And so we're going to see some of that bump around, but I think you nailed it in you're opening question. We really internally look at the trailing 12 months and if it's north of 1.2, we're feeling pretty good and to be at close to 1.4 times that just further tells us we've got strong demand signals. Yes. I think we have consistently said it's a tight labor market that remains true today and into the future. We thought 2.8 organic growth in our headcount. And we're very pleased with that, just given the tightness in the market. As Horacio said, we did have some staff departures, but actually that was a part of deliberate cost synergies that also sort of nudged it down sequentially. So what are we doing about it, got a very aggressive referral program. We're increasingly reaching out to our traditional and non-traditional sources. The overall pipeline of candidates has been growing and because of our culture and because of the recognition we've gotten widely, we are seen as an employer of choice. So we remain optimistic that back to targeting mid single-digits this fiscal year that we're going to get increasingly closer to that. But it still remains a very tight labor market. Yes, we're looking at a 4% to 8% range organically, the midpoint of which is significantly north of our exit and 2022. And to Cai's question, if we're able to hit mid single-digits in terms of bringing on the talent. We think the conversion of our very strong backlog puts us solidly in that space. So momentum is building, we feel good about the demand signals as I mentioned earlier. We're going to continue to make recruiting and onboarding our top operational priority which will put us, we believe in those ranges. Yeah, the 1% is a reflection of our past commentary on M&A. Liberty has been fully integrated as of April as well as Tracepoint. So this year we saw about $340 million of contribution from those guys to our overall performance. So on a go-forward basis we're obviously looking at the financials, but our priority around M&A is strategically going to accelerate our growth. We have strong cultural alignment and then do the financials make sense. And in the case of Liberty and Tracepoint, both of those were great case studies as to how we get there or where we want to be. Good morning, Yeah, you know, the timing of our past tax strategies has put us in the 22% to 24% range. Going forward, we expect it to be at the upper end of that 24%. So in the past years, we were successful in having \u2013 managing our taxes for the long term and able to drive the tax rate down, obviously pending legislation and things of that sort, we're seeing it going in the other direction. So I take push back a little bit on the 50%. The effective tax rate is more in that 23% to 25%, but we've got these additional dynamics as it pertains to the legislation that bumps it up. Correct, correct. Yeah, we've got in terms of our operating cash we've got $850 million to $950 million which back to my prepared remarks, really to us indicates that the operations are solidly generating what we would expect. Yeah. I think you got it right. I mean, that is true. But we're also going to see some things come back to us given our strategies that we've had. So we really see that the timing of payments is really the dynamic that we're grappling with. And we wanted to disclose that to you also, that you you're able to sort of model it and understand it."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be an opportunity for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Laura Adams.\nLaura Adams: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings announcement. We hope you\u2019ve had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide two.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide four.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Laura and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families have been able to stay safe and healthy through the current COVID-19 wave and thank you for joining the call. Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis. We will also describe the underlying dynamics of our business and the progress we are making on our Vault strategy. To set the context, let's go back to our October Investor Day, where we outlined our Vault strategy and associated goals. As a reminder, Vault stands for Velocity Leadership and Technology. It is a strategic program. Booz Allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies. Over the next few years, we look to grow faster by building scaled physicians in critical areas, such as national cyber and digital battle space. We are in the early stages of this journey, but are already making strides, seeing strong progress. As part of Vault, we have set new multi-year financial goals that deliver both strong profit growth and continued investment in our business. Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. That's approximately a 50% increase. We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid tens and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. Our expectations for fiscal year 2022 were consistent with these goals. Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30. We also said this fiscal year growth pattern would look different from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half. As you saw in our press release, our bottom line numbers are on track with our expectations and we are reaffirming our  guidance. Our revenue growth in the third quarter was lighter than we expected and while we forecast strong fourth quarter revenue growth, we're lowering our full fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook to account for a slower pace. Lloyd will take you through the quarter results on our updated guidance in greater depth. There were several factors that contributed to the revenue dynamics for the quarter. On the positive side, we continued to win the right kind of work and hire the right people as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months. Conversely, the translation of those positives into revenue growth was slower than historical standards, driven by a number of factors, including a protractive continuing resolution, a higher dollar value of awards on their protest, delayed awards and slower ramp up on sold contracts, lower staff productivity due in large part to the Omicron variant surging during the quarter and lower than anticipated billable expenses. These dynamics impacted our entire portfolio and some pockets of our defense business were especially hard hit, due part to the number of larger work delayed and a greater proportion of billable expense in their revenue base. Looking ahead, we see some of these challenging dynamics continuing into the coming months. As a result, we are taking a three-pronged approach to proactively manage through this environment. First, we are addressing those business areas where we see the greatest funding uncertainty. Second, we are continuing to control costs in order to deliver in our commitments to both grow adjusted EBITDA and invest in our business. And third, we are doubling down on areas of significant growth opportunity, shifting resources across the portfolio, by leveraging our unique operating model and single P&L. In short, we continue to lean into growth while managing tightly in the face of greater market volatility. Before turning the call over to Lloyd, let me return to the longer term outlook and the progress we have made in our business so far. As we look ahead, we remain on track to deliver strong growth in adjusted EBITDA through fiscal year 2025, supported by continued revenue, growth, stable adjusted EBITDA margins, and strategic deployment of capital. Our confidence in the future is predicated in our belief that we have the right strategy and the proven ability to execute in both good times and challenging ones and several accomplishments from the last few months underscore these points. First, we continue to win the right kind of work at the center of national priorities where innovation can help the government transform the way the mission is executed. Our clients from the department of Veterans Affairs to the Air Force are looking to Booz Allen for expertise in areas such as DevSecOps, AI and the commercialization of new technologies to advance their missions. Second, we are making key investments that differentiate our service to clients. For example, last December, as part of our ramp up on national cyber, we announced the opening of our carrier grade 5G lab in Central Maryland. The lab offers a state of the art testing environment for secure cyber resilient 5G solutions. Similarly, as we advance our work on digital battle space, we are significantly expanding our footprint in Honolulu. This investment deploys into the INDOPACOM region, some of our most advanced capabilities to expand our support of several high priority client missions. Third, we are successfully using acquisitions as strategic accelerators, Liberty and Trace Point continue to deliver the strategic and financial value we expected. Integration is going well, and we are extremely pleased with the upside these acquisitions create and in addition, we continue to build our acquisition pipeline. And forth and perhaps most importantly, we continue to strengthen our team and ensure we have the focus and resiliency to support our clients as they too manage through a volatile environment. I am extremely proud of our workforce for achieving complete compliance with our COVID vaccination requirement. Our purpose and values are at the core of everything we do. So we believe that prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees is the right thing to do for our institution, our clients and our communities. Furthermore, a fully vaccinated workforce allows us to better serve our clients, supports safer in-person collaboration and is critical to entering a post pandemic phase. Together, always together, the people of Booz Allen are forging ahead with relentless focus in our client's missions and our growth strategy. This is what delivers the consistent results that create long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd for more details on the third quarter, the fiscal year and our investment thesis. Lloyd over to you.\nLloyd Howell: Thank you, Horacio. As we near the end of fiscal year, 2022 a year marked by many twists and turns, we have continued to build on our underlying fundamentals, which have supported our expectations for second half performance outpacing first half. And while top line growth and cash did not deliver at the levels we anticipated, we are delivering the bottom line results we need to invest in our business and our people to achieve our long term growth initiatives. With three quarters now completed and greater visibility into the fourth quarter, we are seeing some transitory changes at the macro level that are impacting overall market performance. The expanding on what Horacio said, just as we believe that we were turning the corner on the pandemic's impacts and reverting to more predictable business patterns, we were hit by Omicron, which led to another spike in PTO resulting in staff utilization rates, not normalizing as we had anticipated. This coupled with an overhang effect from the continuing resolution has impacted our ability to convert strong demand into top line growth. We factored some of this uncertainty into our 2022 fiscal year guidance, but we did not fully anticipate the impact of a second wave on utilizing, nor did we foresee the delays in translating wins into revenue generation. I will get into more detail shortly when I give updated guidance. Now for the details of the third quarter, please turn to Slide five. At the top line, revenue increased 6.6% year-over-year to $2 billion, which includes approximately $117 million from inorganic contributions. Revenue, excluding billable expenses grew 6.2% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Revenue growth was slower this quarter for the following three reasons. First funding delays resulting in slower ramps on new work and existing work. Second, lower staff utilization resulting from an uptick in PTO taken over the holiday period due in part to arise in COVID cases and the inclusion of the New Year\u2019s eve holiday in this quarter's results. And third, billable expenses continue to be pressured by slower travel patterns and the timing of material purchases getting pushed to the right. Taken together, these factors are largely timing issues that we believe will dissipate as we return to more normal business rhythms. Now let me walk through the market level performance. Starting with defense, revenue declined by 2.2% year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter. Since defence is roughly 50% of our business portfolio and largely comprised of cost reimbursable work, the macro factors and subsequent top line impacts I noted were especially impactful in this market. More specifically to expand on what Horacio said our army account was hit the hardest by some of these dynamics where our performance was impacted by budgetary challenges, slowness in ramp up and some losses. Going forward, our defense leadership is doubling down on addressing these issues by growing headcount, managing utilization and aggressively deploying talent to capture the value opportunities, including hypergrowth initiatives such as our digital battle space platform. In Civil revenue grew by 25.3% year-over-year of which 5.1% was organic, marking our second consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth. Our results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which are yielding important wins. Additionally, Liberty continues to strengthen our unique market position as we prepare to leverage integrated capabilities in the areas of cloud DevSecOps and API development to pursue additional market share across our broader portfolio. In intelligence, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of growth at 0.8% year over year. This continued improvement in performance reflects our ability to hire ahead of growing demand and capitalize on our mission expertise and advanced technological offerings to secure key recompetes and new work opportunities. This positions us for multiyear growth in key areas, including digital modernization, artificial intelligence, and high end data analytics. Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 26.7% compared to the prior year period. Performance was driven by growing demand in our US commercial cyber business and contributions from Tracepoint where we are seeing strong cross-selling momentum and early synergies. We are now on Slide Six. Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million up 29% over the prior year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12 month book-to-bill of 1.28 times. Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year-over-year to $27.8 billion. Funded backlog grew 11.7% to $4 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 57.7% to $9.4 billion and price options grew 4.4% to $14.3 billion. These results underscore continued demand and strong alignment to our clients' core missions in the areas of artificial intelligence, cyber and digital modernization to name a few and further our position as a trusted partner and market leader. Looking ahead, as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids, we anticipate that ongoing protest will become part of the normal business cycle, which we are increasingly factoring into our operating plan. Pivoting to headcount, as of December 31, we had approximately 29,500 employees, an increase of approximately 1900 year-over-year or 6.8%. The labor market for tech and tech adjacent talent remains highly competitive, but we are pleased that we continue to successfully execute on our hiring and retention strategies, a reflection of our appeal as an employer of choice. This resulted in a third consecutive quarter of mid-single digit headcount growth, consistent with our expectations. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million up 8% from the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 10.9% compared to 10.8% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by three factors. First, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions. Second, prudent cost management, and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $2 million negative impact on the prior year period under the Cares Act, a tailwind that will taper off after this quarter. Third quarter net income decreased 10.8% year-over-year to $129 million. Adjusted net income was $137 million down 5.5% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.8% to $0.95 from $1.03 the prior year period and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $1.02 from $1.04. Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense, partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP metrics exclude certain acquisition costs and the non-cash gain of $7.1 million from the spinoff of SnapAttack during the quarter. Turning to cash, cash from operations was $21 million in the third quarter down from $233 million in the prior year comparable period. Operating cash performance is volatile a quarter to quarter and the decline this period was more pronounced due to some of the factors impacting top line growth, coupled with higher disbursements. As we have done before, we are focused on our working cash management and cash collection efforts to continue improving our operating cash performance and reinforce our strong balance sheet. Year to date, we have generated $481 million in operating cash flow and $430 million in free cash for a free cash conversion rate, nearing 100% supporting our strong balance sheet positioning and capital deployment priorities. Please turn to Slide Seven. During the quarter, we deployed approximately $139 million inclusive of $50 million in quarterly dividends and $83 million in share repurchases. Today we are also pleased to announce that the board has increased our quarterly dividends by $0.06 to $0.43 per share payable on March 2 to stockholders of record on February 11. This marks our ninth consecutive fiscal year of increasing our quarterly dividend, a testament to our fundamental strength and promise to continue growing our dividend even in a more challenging operating environment. With one quarter left in this fiscal year, we remain committed to a patient, disciplined capital allocation strategy, leveraging our strong balance sheet position to deploy capital in an accretive manner, creating near and long term shareholder value. As we have said in October, our capital deployment priorities remain focused on strategic M&A to enhance growth while sustaining a healthy dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares. Let me now walk you through how the puts and takes from the quarter translate into updates to our full year fiscal 2022 guidance. Please move to Slide Eight. Despite lighter revenue and operating cash challenges this quarter, we are proud of our team's efforts to manage the business controlling what we can in spite of another wave of macro environmental challenges. These efforts have enabled margin expansion with solid ADIP's performance throughout this fiscal year as we reinforce the strength of our fundamentals and balance sheet in preparation to execute on our investment thesis. In the fourth quarter, we are laser focused on executing against our operational priorities. We will continue to aggressively hire ahead of demand capitalizing on our strong portfolio of new work opportunities to sustain long term organic growth. We will efficiently manage the business by investing in our people and technology to lead the next wave of innovation. And lastly, continue to build our M&A pipeline and acquire businesses that meet our disciplined criteria to serve as strategic accelerators. Our revised guidance reflects these efforts. In addition to the third quarter performance and trends I just outlined, let me run through the numbers. For the full fiscal year, revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 5.7% to 7.2%. At the midpoint, our revised guidance range reflects $100 million to $220 million of revenues tied to the uncertainties we outlined earlier. They break down as follows. $30 million to $80 million tied to funding delays and resulting slowness in deploying staff unsold and funded work. $20 million to $40 million tied to an incremental step down in staff utilization due largely to the continuing pandemic in PTO usage and $50 million to $100 million from lower pandemic related travel and the timing of materials purchase getting pushed to the right. As a reminder, the inclusion of the New Year\u2019s Eve holiday and minor differences in the costing of labor related to the implementation of our NextGen financial management system will become tailwinds in the fourth quarter, adding roughly 175 basis points to the top line. On the bottom line, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year to be approximately 11%. This increase reflects our considerable control over our cost structure and margin levers even in times of uncertainty. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.10 and $4.30. The a ADIP's guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24%, $134 million to $137 million weighted average shares outstanding and interest expense of $92 million to $95 million. We now expect operating cash to be between $700 million and $750 million. The incremental step down follows our expectations for lower top line growth and accounts for the $56 million of one time payments in connection with the Liberty acquisition, which we had anticipated, being able to make up through a combination of working capital management and operating performance. As I mentioned, we will remain laser focused on optimizing our working capital to return to the strong level of cash version we have historically delivered to position us ahead of future growth initiatives. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $100 million. As we move towards our investment thesis, I remain confident in our team's ability to manage through these times of uncertainty as we have proven our ability to do over the years. We will continue to execute on our near term growth objectives and remain competent in the long term trajectory of the business, upholding our role as the industry leader and meeting the high standards our shareholders have come to expect. With that over to you, Laura.\nLaura Adams: Thank you, Lloyd. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferie. Your light is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Horacio, Lloyd, Laura. Thank you. Horacio, you stated you're addressing business areas with the greatest funding uncertainty and Lloyd, you mentioned efforts within defense and the army specifically. Defense remained down 2% in the quarter. How do we think about  specifically within that decline and what are the other areas leading to that pick up  decline and how do you think about the return to growth there?\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Sheila. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think to put things in context as we mentioned in the prepare remarks, the volatility in the market driven by both COVID and then some funding issues, both with the CR and just some slowness in terms of getting funding on contracts is affecting our portfolio and particularly affecting our defense business. And we're not going to try to predict the precise timing on when those issues are going to abate. Instead we are really working through them. If I take a step back, our -- I would say, as a firm and certainly in our defense business, we are on strategy and the fundamentals are actually strong. If you look at the work that we're winning and you can see the backlog numbers and then the record backlog and the increases in funded backlog, they tell a really good story about that and the quality of the work underneath that is very, very strong. We're hiring strongly across all of our markets, including defense, and we are managing through this volatility to deliver on the investment thesis. So the job for all of us and in our defense portfolio is first to address these performance issues that we have in certain pockets of the business. Lloyd talked about our army business that's been hard hit by some of these dynamics and we are doing that. We need to control costs and we are doing that and you see that in our bottom line numbers across the entire business, to make sure that we are delivering on this adjusted EBITDA dollar targets that we have in our investment thesis. And then importantly, we need to double down on growth and in the defense portfolio, there are some really strong areas of growth around some of our classified work, around some of our space work and around digital battle space and all things related to the digital transformation of the department, both at headquarters and at the edge. So, I look at all of that and, and accepting and managing through the near term volatility, I think that in the medium term, we are very much on track to continue to be the leader and to continue to grow.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: No that's super helpful. And then maybe one more broadly, you guys have been the growth leaders in this space. There's no doubt about that. But organic growth revenue implied for fiscal 2022 is more in the right of 2% to 4% and below your 5% to 7%, '23 to '25 target. So how do we kind of think about this reac acceleration to mid-single digit growth and the implied high single digit organic growth guidance for Q4? I know you addressed a lot of these during your Analyst Day too.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah. Lloyd, do you want to start and then I'll\u2026\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, I'll start. So Sheila, as we said, our prepared remarks, it's a combination of three factors that have us in that 2% to 4%, the funding delays, the lower staff utilization and lower billable expenses. That being said, we're laser focused on the things that are in our control. We said that our operational priority was bringing in talent and we're doing that 3.6 year over year, organic and 6.8 year-over-year overall. We're winning work. Our backlog is up 19% year-over-year. Latest our trailing 12 months at 1.28 times. So we're winning work that we want to win. We're engaged with our clients on topics that are forward leaning, but we do face these challenges and we feel that the path through this volatility is really to focus on the things that are in our control, which is winning work and hiring the best talent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: Guys, I appreciate all the detail and the revenue headwinds and all the color and everything you've said, but I'm kind having dejavu to 3Q of last year and we've delays and procurements toward slippage, pullback and funding, etcetera. I appreciate COVID has persisted much longer than any of us would've thought, but basically been over a year now where you haven't grown organically. So I'm just curious, how do you get confidence that there isn't actually a structural change in customer behavior and the way they're thinking about spending?\nHoracio Rozanski: Gavin? I appreciate the question and here's what I would say. First of all, I talk to a lot of clients about this, and when I listen to them about where their mission priorities are, what we are doing and how we're aligned to that, I feel very strongly that, like I said, we're on strategy and underlying fundamentals are good. Typically in our business, as you know, if you take headcount growth from some level of wage increase that gives you a sense for how much we're going to grow and especially if we're not demand constrained and you can see the backlog numbers, we're not. So we have confidence that in the, I call it the medium term we are in very good shape positioned to continue to grow and to be the growth leader in the market. And we are, I think we've come to terms with the reality that there there's more volatility and more unpredictability in some of these -- some of these variables around COVID and around funding that perhaps we anticipated, but put all together. I go back to the point that Lloyd made, which is the underlying fundamentals in the business are strong. We're focused on them. And we're focused on delivering at the bottom line where we have control over the cost structure to make sure we deliver our investment thesis.\nLloyd Howell: Kevin, I would just add like yourself. I had a dejavu moment as well, because many of the dynamics that we were grappling with a year ago and we're still grappling with. I think, we expected that in early October, things were going to open up again along, came Omicron and definitely had an impact on our workforce. We expected that this far into the administration that things would start to flow, but we're still seeing slowness and ramp up and, and kicking off things, and that's just the environment we're in now. We're not making excuses. Like Horacio and I have said, we are focused on the operational items that are in our control. It's playing out with strong bottom line results which we're very proud about but we're going to have choppiness at the top line and we're just going to keep staying on strategy and executing as well as we have up to this point.\nGavin Parsons: I appreciate that insight. That definitely feels like the need is there and the budget is already there too so. And maybe on margins, just kind of continuing to outperform there. You obviously, the longer term investor day target is 10.5, I think you've got tailwinds from mix shift and cost containment that you outlined at the Investor Day, partially offset by investment growth. Are you managing to a 10.5% number or is there upside to that if you can kind of continue to outperform on makeshift and cost containment?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, we're not managing to mid 10s. In fact we're very pleased with 10.9% for this quarter because really, it speaks to our operational performance, our discipline around cost control and solid fundamentals and we have an expectation of ourselves to continue that going forward. The raise to approximately 11% is a reality of that, that we're seeing really good mid shift in terms of our contract types. The discipline that we've had we're going to stay focused on that as well as the core business fundamentals that we've talked about and given that volatility that we're experiencing. So that's what we're moving to. That's why we're confident about around been for the full year. But it's really the fundamentals that we've been focused on that's gotten us to 10.9% at this point.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Canfield with Barclays. Your line is open.\nColin Canfield: So growth in substance pretty well documented at this point, trading you to services names. Can you just talk about how this is impacting the valuation of your M&A pipeline, both on kind of a public and private basis?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start you know, we are seeing continued growth in our M&A opportunities in the functional areas that we're emphasizing cyber security, data analytics, system software development and engineering and science, still mid to I mean small to mid-size opportunities. We're having strong -- with our strong balance sheet and capacity, we're not seeing valuations in these particular areas spike, but keep in mind, we're also doing a better job in terms of cultivating the opportunities based on the relationships, we have based on knowing the industry as well as we do and I think that has in some ways insulated us from what we see more broadly with some of the elevated valuations should it go into an auction, but up to this point, we haven't seen a spike in valuation.\nColin Canfield: Got it. And then going back to your comment at the start Horacio, you mentioned scaled cyber you just update us on where Booz Allen Hamilton stands in terms of scale and kind of where scale matters the most and in terms of your underlying business areas. Thanks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I think you you've heard me say this in the past. I actually really like our positioning throughout the portfolio. Across all three of our major market areas we've deployed our innovation agenda and positioned ourselves strongly as players in all of these key technologies from, we we've talked before about the fact that we've been ready as having the largest cyber workforce in North America, the strongest AI footprint in DOD some of the work we're doing about 5G these days is both breakthrough and growing. And we are looking to invest in areas like INDOPACOM as I mentioned, the prepare remarks and continuing to work the intersection of, for example, AI, 5G and cyber, which we believe will drive another wave of growth. And from a scale standpoint, we spent the last really decade. I'm asking a talent base that actually gives us a lot of flexibility to go into this areas and to really focus on where the growth it's going to be. So, that we Lloyd mentioned our civil portfolio for example, is that very strongly. We're very well aligned to the domestic agenda for the country. And we look forward to continuing to grow well there while we pursue on growth also in defense and in intelligence.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMatt Akers: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. Could you just touch on your recent spin out of Mozi  and Snap Attack? Why are those businesses sort of are off outside of Booz and are there any other parts of your business that you're looking to potentially buy back?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I'll start, I think I go back to Vault and this notion of Velocity, and that is informing a lot of our thinking about how we want to manage the portfolio going forward and honestly, in both directions. So with Liberty and with Trace Points, we made two acquisitions that are really good accelerators for our growth, and they're playing out frankly above our expectations at this point. And we're very pleased, not just with the financial returns that they're driving but with the strategic positioning that they're allowing. By the same token, as we looked at the entire portfolio in some of these areas, we created solutions and we have unique IP. We asked ourselves if we were the right player by ourselves to capitalize on the growth in those commercial markets and we came to the conclusion that those businesses would grow better, faster with a different investor base and with partners, we remain involved as minority owners in those businesses because we believe in them and we're excited to see where that will take us and frankly, we're learning a lot about how to both, make venture investments and the minority partners in these fast growing entities and then how do we take advantage of all of that IP and those market positions that are getting created to drive growth into the core of our defense Intel and civil markets and again, I think the future is bright on that front.\nMatt Akers: That's great. Thanks. And then, I guess maybe once for Lloyd, just on the free cash flow guidance change and I know you mentioned kind of the lower top line, but I think the EBITDA kind of dollars guidance is not that different. Is it more just a collections timing kind of thing, or any more kind of detail you could give there?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah. Matt, cash definitely was lighter due to some of the headwinds we talked about in revenue, but specifically around cash, we had lower collections. Some of that was just due to revenue being a little bit lower funding delays, the near celebration falling Q3. The same time we had higher disbursements and payroll expense. So, the incremental impacts about $35 million of collection slipped increase in payroll expense. That being said we're still focused on a 100% cash conversion for the year. And I also sort of offer the following context, this year we had the Liberty acquisition as well as added interest from the June bond issuance and that's kind of offset some of the operational improvements that we've made. And that being said, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're laser focused on this. We expect it to improve going forward as we sort of work through these near-term headwinds, if you will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, as you probably know the  was down about 3% to 4% for the quarter itself. So are you seeing any signs that this bookings environment that's been so slow, are changing in any way. And secondly, what about protests? How big are they and, any expectation that some of those things are going to be adjudicated?\nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, I can start. I think we, as we mentioned in our defense business, we have seen some slow down on some booming to the right. On some contracts, some slower ramp-up and our overall protest backlog, if you will, or the amount of under protest that therefore is not in our backlog is at an all-time high. Having said that, things are moving along, as I said, clients do have the urgency. And so I think over time, some of these will normalize, we're certainly watching closely the, the CR has affected our defense business more than we would have expected and to a degree. I worry about that, but I frankly worry about the impact of the share-on mission and then compounded by the, the COVID PTO and the fact that that Omicron drove a, again, a record number of cases inside Booz Allen. All of that is the volatility that we are talking through, but I take us back to the underlying fundamentals. We are focused on the things our clients are focused on. They are, our backlog is strong, our Book-to-bill for the last 12 months is strong and we're hiring the right people. So we believe that over time, some of these will normalize and we're going to continue focusing on the things we can control.\nLloyd Howell: Hey Cai, I would just add that for the most part, our Book-to-bill pattern is consistent, 0.3, nine times for this quarter is comparable to what we saw last year at this point. And in trailing 12 months of 1.28 to Tracepoint. We feel is pretty plenty strength and demand signal. We are still going to see volatility though, some of these larger procurements as they come through, depending upon protest resolution timing which certainly is moving all over the place, is going to continue to impact the traditional pattern of our Book-to-bill. But we're winning incumbent work at 90%, new work to grow 60%. So, on the demand signals, we, we're still feeling pretty good. 0\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much. And one on the receivables, your DSOs were high at the end of the first quarter, because you implemented the ERP system. They improved in the second and now they spiked up to about 73 days. That is basically I think, a sector high. What do you \u2013 what -- why is it that bad and what are you doing to make it better? And where do you think you can get?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, we to, I think Matt's question we're focused on, getting it down. It's a function of really being diligent and disciplined on collections; really continuing to balance that out with our disbursements. And the team's on it. Cash will be volatile, in this current environment, but we expect to see improvement it going forward. So, no excuses we're on it. And I expect that we'll, we'll do better going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sharpe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open\nMatthew Sharpe: Horacio and Lloyd, good morning gentlemen. On the M&A front, just given the shorter cycle nature of your current business mix and sort of the sensitivities to budget disruptions. Is there any desire to either acquire Companies with relatively deeper backlogs or somewhat longer cycle business models and then related to that, how has the Liberty IT acquisition fared in this CR environment in the, in the surge in COVID 19 cases?\nLloyd Howell: So, I, I think looking at our M&A strategy, it's consistent with Vault and with all the things that we have said, we're looking to deploy between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion between now and 2025, with a focus on things that can be strategic accelerators for us. So are there positions technologies, unique opportunities to move faster, to develop things faster Liberty and Tracepoints were really good examples of that. And we're building a pipeline of opportunities that really mirrors that it's either a unique technology or a technology mission intersection that really accelerates on our priorities. And especially around either national cyber or digital battle space, we're going to be very diligent and very assertive in terms of generating that pipeline. Liberty is done, very well since the acquisition. It's, it's a good, the integration is going well. The teams have found lots of points of touch, where we are working together, both in their core markets around health and beginning to expand across other parts of our portfolio from a COVID CR. And so forth, they reflect the rest of the business and they are because they're more civil oriented, they're seeing more of the dynamics that we see in the civil market, as opposed to the, the, the more difficult dynamics we saw most recently in defense. But I think they're, again, they're a great team. They're a great acquisition for us and they're a pattern for us to continue to follow. I -- they don't have much to add, but your question around sort of backlog to right ride through some of the, the short term cycles, obviously when we're doing due diligence, it's a variety of areas we're looking at - talent, pipeline positioning, you name it. So it's certainly in the mix, but to Tracepoint, we're not leading with that. It's still, is it on strategy, our confidence on integration it's adherence to Vault and achieving of our updated investment thesis. But yeah, for sure, we're looking at what upside do does a Company have strengthen their talent and the list goes on and on.\nMatthew Sharpe: Got it; and then I just want to touch on a recent win you had with, with this the thunder do zero trust environment prototype. What does the path forward for that program or, or that contract look like for booze beyond the prototype days in and while the award itself was seemingly modest there is certainly touted as a fairly significant step forward for, for zero trust. So just any thoughts on that contract and it's path forward itself, and then more broadly on zero trust in the opportunity associated with it.\nHoracio Rozanski: I think it's a, obviously, we're, we're very pleased with both the, the win and the opportunities ahead. And I think to put it in context, right, it, it hits right at the intersection of the, of the type of work we want to do where we're driving, leading edge thinking and leading edge capabilities. We have demonstrated leadership on zero trust across both our commercial and our federal markets. And that is translating into wins across the portfolio. We are excited that we're beginning to see that not just in, more of our, the traditional places where we want that work, but allowing it to to expand further. So I'm as I, I said at the top of the call, we are on strategy, we're winning this kind of work that has great opportunity for us to, expand, to go forward and to help the department and more broadly the federal government transform missions through the use of new technologies. That's what we're all about. And that's what we intend to do.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much. And good morning everyone. I think I, I hadn't quite appreciated maybe the contribution that Tracepoint was making in, in the quarter. And, and so I saw how much the acquisition revenue went out from Q2 to Q3. Can you kind of break out what was what was Liberty versus what was Tracepoint ?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, Liberty was a little over a hundred million it's ahead of our annualized Tracepoint north of 300, probably less than 350 Tracepoint added 12 million. So we're pleased with how well both integrations are going really winning new work already head of pace, great integration with both Companies. So, those things I think are definitely contributing to the financial outcomes and contributions we're seeing.\nSeth Seifman: Right. Okay. And then if we, if we assume that those are at a similar pace in the, in the fourth quarter, it, it implies a decent size step up in the sales, excluding those acquired businesses and, we'll still have a CR in place for half a quarter and still have, an situation here in I think starting to see some folks come back to the office, including here in New York, but still have some of this disruption. And so I guess, a kind of, what, what gives you confidence about that as we think about what the base of sales is going to be for 2023 growth, and then, given just the near term chops in the environment how should we think about maybe the initial growth rate for, for fiscal '23 versus the versus the longer term target?\nLloyd Howell: Yeah, I mean, Seth, we're not going to get into me giving guidance for '23, but I will say normally at this year when we're updating guide guidance, I'm narrowing it. And I think because of many of the factors that are contributing to the volatility I think it's a pretty obvious it it's a challenge to do that. So with the headwinds that we articulate that we're working, on with the range of five, seven to seven two we feel pretty confident that we're going to end up in that range. And it really points back to what we need to continue to be focused on, which is bringing the talent and getting them utilized is as fast as possible. And I think those fundamentals gives us confidence that we're going to build the momentum in Q4, and it's going to carry over into '23 as to what that range in '23 is going to be let me get to that in May, but at this point we're feeling good about our guidance for this fiscal year.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah, Seth, if I would just come back to the, the point that we are very focused on the fundamentals and of the things we can control. We are trying to drive strong growth in the areas where the opportunities are still there. We are hiring the right people, we're winning the right work, we're managing costs. And ultimately we are committed to working hard to drive against our investment thesis and to implement Vault. And I think on that note we are, we're well positioned to continue to drive growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, good morning. Without asking about fiscal '23, I thought I'd maybe take another angle of this, but Lloyd, you said the funding delays were about a $30 million to $80 million pressure, in the guide down, I'm assuming Q4 pressure. If we annualize that or extend, is that a fairly good proxy for what happens if the CR goes the full fiscal year?\nLloyd Howell: I wish -- I wish I could do that, but I think if anything, we've learned over the last two years, speculating on that isn't a great move, like we're playing the game for what we can see and then chipping away at it to get the successes. We had growth in the second half, we are growing and it's really back to the fundamentals that are giving us strong bottom-line performance. But this is here to stay and, and we're on top of it or that great team pointed out this prepared remarks and everyone's pulling as hard as they can. I'd also remind you that, that what we did share is that we are focused on EBITDA dollar growth as a part of our investment thesis, and we believe we're on track to deliver on that. \nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah, I'll just would stomp the, a point that Lloyd is making -- we are focused on growth and we are driving growth. And while we accept the volatility in the market and we're going to work through it, we are not pulling back from our desire and our ability to, to drive. Obviously if the CR clears that'll be better than if it doesn't, but we are single manly focused on driving this business\nRobert Spingarn: Well, while Horacio on that note. And this is either for you or for Lloyd, but I I'm going to imagine, you took a close look at the NDAA and the plus ups there, and while maybe little greater for the investment accounts than for  how do we think about Booz's benefit from those plus up when we finally get them?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think they play to a lot of our strengths. I, if you look at it, there's elements of that that that will strengthen our ability to, to deploy in Cyber 5G, AI Cloud, and even Quantum. So these are all areas that where we believe we built a unique position of leadership and this is why we keep coming back to the fundamentals are strong. And, we don't find ourselves in that sense demand constraint the speed at which these wins get on contract. And then we can put people against them where the, the near-term challenges reside. But, but when you look beyond that, we are aligned with the key priorities of the department and excited to support them.\nRobert Spingarn: Is it, an overreach for me to try and ask you to quantify, out of that $25 billion, $30 billion, what piece of that either Booze or the Government services community can access?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'm not sure that, that we can do that and as a lot of our work is integrated in a way that it doesn't sit on one specific line item. It really is around our, our support on these core missions. And again, if you look at the missions that are being highlighted and the, the, the type of work that we are winning, that we are doing I, I would point to the fact that there's great convergence of both of those.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll be brief because we went a little over time. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning I hope this discussion gave you a deeper understanding of the dynamics that are underlying our performance and how we are managing through them. And as a result, why we are confident that we can deliver in both near and long-term financial goals, and that's driven by three things we believe we have the right strategy. We have a track record of performance, and most importantly, we do have a great team and with thank you again, stay safe and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect everyone. Have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Laura and good morning, everyone. I hope that you and your families have been able to stay safe and healthy through the current COVID-19 wave and thank you for joining the call. Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis. We will also describe the underlying dynamics of our business and the progress we are making on our Vault strategy. To set the context, let's go back to our October Investor Day, where we outlined our Vault strategy and associated goals. As a reminder, Vault stands for Velocity Leadership and Technology. It is a strategic program. Booz Allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies. Over the next few years, we look to grow faster by building scaled physicians in critical areas, such as national cyber and digital battle space. We are in the early stages of this journey, but are already making strides, seeing strong progress. As part of Vault, we have set new multi-year financial goals that deliver both strong profit growth and continued investment in our business. Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. That's approximately a 50% increase. We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid tens and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. Our expectations for fiscal year 2022 were consistent with these goals. Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30. We also said this fiscal year growth pattern would look different from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half. As you saw in our press release, our bottom line numbers are on track with our expectations and we are reaffirming our  guidance. Our revenue growth in the third quarter was lighter than we expected and while we forecast strong fourth quarter revenue growth, we're lowering our full fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook to account for a slower pace. Lloyd will take you through the quarter results on our updated guidance in greater depth. There were several factors that contributed to the revenue dynamics for the quarter. On the positive side, we continued to win the right kind of work and hire the right people as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months. Conversely, the translation of those positives into revenue growth was slower than historical standards, driven by a number of factors, including a protractive continuing resolution, a higher dollar value of awards on their protest, delayed awards and slower ramp up on sold contracts, lower staff productivity due in large part to the Omicron variant surging during the quarter and lower than anticipated billable expenses. These dynamics impacted our entire portfolio and some pockets of our defense business were especially hard hit, due part to the number of larger work delayed and a greater proportion of billable expense in their revenue base. Looking ahead, we see some of these challenging dynamics continuing into the coming months. As a result, we are taking a three-pronged approach to proactively manage through this environment. First, we are addressing those business areas where we see the greatest funding uncertainty. Second, we are continuing to control costs in order to deliver in our commitments to both grow adjusted EBITDA and invest in our business. And third, we are doubling down on areas of significant growth opportunity, shifting resources across the portfolio, by leveraging our unique operating model and single P&L. In short, we continue to lean into growth while managing tightly in the face of greater market volatility. Before turning the call over to Lloyd, let me return to the longer term outlook and the progress we have made in our business so far. As we look ahead, we remain on track to deliver strong growth in adjusted EBITDA through fiscal year 2025, supported by continued revenue, growth, stable adjusted EBITDA margins, and strategic deployment of capital. Our confidence in the future is predicated in our belief that we have the right strategy and the proven ability to execute in both good times and challenging ones and several accomplishments from the last few months underscore these points. First, we continue to win the right kind of work at the center of national priorities where innovation can help the government transform the way the mission is executed. Our clients from the department of Veterans Affairs to the Air Force are looking to Booz Allen for expertise in areas such as DevSecOps, AI and the commercialization of new technologies to advance their missions. Second, we are making key investments that differentiate our service to clients. For example, last December, as part of our ramp up on national cyber, we announced the opening of our carrier grade 5G lab in Central Maryland. The lab offers a state of the art testing environment for secure cyber resilient 5G solutions. Similarly, as we advance our work on digital battle space, we are significantly expanding our footprint in Honolulu. This investment deploys into the INDOPACOM region, some of our most advanced capabilities to expand our support of several high priority client missions. Third, we are successfully using acquisitions as strategic accelerators, Liberty and Trace Point continue to deliver the strategic and financial value we expected. Integration is going well, and we are extremely pleased with the upside these acquisitions create and in addition, we continue to build our acquisition pipeline. And forth and perhaps most importantly, we continue to strengthen our team and ensure we have the focus and resiliency to support our clients as they too manage through a volatile environment. I am extremely proud of our workforce for achieving complete compliance with our COVID vaccination requirement. Our purpose and values are at the core of everything we do. So we believe that prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees is the right thing to do for our institution, our clients and our communities. Furthermore, a fully vaccinated workforce allows us to better serve our clients, supports safer in-person collaboration and is critical to entering a post pandemic phase. Together, always together, the people of Booz Allen are forging ahead with relentless focus in our client's missions and our growth strategy. This is what delivers the consistent results that create long term shareholder value. And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd for more details on the third quarter, the fiscal year and our investment thesis. Lloyd over to you. Hey, Sheila. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I think to put things in context as we mentioned in the prepare remarks, the volatility in the market driven by both COVID and then some funding issues, both with the CR and just some slowness in terms of getting funding on contracts is affecting our portfolio and particularly affecting our defense business. And we're not going to try to predict the precise timing on when those issues are going to abate. Instead we are really working through them. If I take a step back, our -- I would say, as a firm and certainly in our defense business, we are on strategy and the fundamentals are actually strong. If you look at the work that we're winning and you can see the backlog numbers and then the record backlog and the increases in funded backlog, they tell a really good story about that and the quality of the work underneath that is very, very strong. We're hiring strongly across all of our markets, including defense, and we are managing through this volatility to deliver on the investment thesis. So the job for all of us and in our defense portfolio is first to address these performance issues that we have in certain pockets of the business. Lloyd talked about our army business that's been hard hit by some of these dynamics and we are doing that. We need to control costs and we are doing that and you see that in our bottom line numbers across the entire business, to make sure that we are delivering on this adjusted EBITDA dollar targets that we have in our investment thesis. And then importantly, we need to double down on growth and in the defense portfolio, there are some really strong areas of growth around some of our classified work, around some of our space work and around digital battle space and all things related to the digital transformation of the department, both at headquarters and at the edge. So, I look at all of that and, and accepting and managing through the near term volatility, I think that in the medium term, we are very much on track to continue to be the leader and to continue to grow. Yeah. Lloyd, do you want to start and then I'll... Gavin? I appreciate the question and here's what I would say. First of all, I talk to a lot of clients about this, and when I listen to them about where their mission priorities are, what we are doing and how we're aligned to that, I feel very strongly that, like I said, we're on strategy and underlying fundamentals are good. Typically in our business, as you know, if you take headcount growth from some level of wage increase that gives you a sense for how much we're going to grow and especially if we're not demand constrained and you can see the backlog numbers, we're not. So we have confidence that in the, I call it the medium term we are in very good shape positioned to continue to grow and to be the growth leader in the market. And we are, I think we've come to terms with the reality that there there's more volatility and more unpredictability in some of these -- some of these variables around COVID and around funding that perhaps we anticipated, but put all together. I go back to the point that Lloyd made, which is the underlying fundamentals in the business are strong. We're focused on them. And we're focused on delivering at the bottom line where we have control over the cost structure to make sure we deliver our investment thesis. I'll start you know, we are seeing continued growth in our M&A opportunities in the functional areas that we're emphasizing cyber security, data analytics, system software development and engineering and science, still mid to I mean small to mid-size opportunities. We're having strong -- with our strong balance sheet and capacity, we're not seeing valuations in these particular areas spike, but keep in mind, we're also doing a better job in terms of cultivating the opportunities based on the relationships, we have based on knowing the industry as well as we do and I think that has in some ways insulated us from what we see more broadly with some of the elevated valuations should it go into an auction, but up to this point, we haven't seen a spike in valuation. Sure. I think you you've heard me say this in the past. I actually really like our positioning throughout the portfolio. Across all three of our major market areas we've deployed our innovation agenda and positioned ourselves strongly as players in all of these key technologies from, we we've talked before about the fact that we've been ready as having the largest cyber workforce in North America, the strongest AI footprint in DOD some of the work we're doing about 5G these days is both breakthrough and growing. And we are looking to invest in areas like INDOPACOM as I mentioned, the prepare remarks and continuing to work the intersection of, for example, AI, 5G and cyber, which we believe will drive another wave of growth. And from a scale standpoint, we spent the last really decade. I'm asking a talent base that actually gives us a lot of flexibility to go into this areas and to really focus on where the growth it's going to be. So, that we Lloyd mentioned our civil portfolio for example, is that very strongly. We're very well aligned to the domestic agenda for the country. And we look forward to continuing to grow well there while we pursue on growth also in defense and in intelligence. Sure. I'll start, I think I go back to Vault and this notion of Velocity, and that is informing a lot of our thinking about how we want to manage the portfolio going forward and honestly, in both directions. So with Liberty and with Trace Points, we made two acquisitions that are really good accelerators for our growth, and they're playing out frankly above our expectations at this point. And we're very pleased, not just with the financial returns that they're driving but with the strategic positioning that they're allowing. By the same token, as we looked at the entire portfolio in some of these areas, we created solutions and we have unique IP. We asked ourselves if we were the right player by ourselves to capitalize on the growth in those commercial markets and we came to the conclusion that those businesses would grow better, faster with a different investor base and with partners, we remain involved as minority owners in those businesses because we believe in them and we're excited to see where that will take us and frankly, we're learning a lot about how to both, make venture investments and the minority partners in these fast growing entities and then how do we take advantage of all of that IP and those market positions that are getting created to drive growth into the core of our defense Intel and civil markets and again, I think the future is bright on that front. Cai, I can start. I think we, as we mentioned in our defense business, we have seen some slow down on some booming to the right. On some contracts, some slower ramp-up and our overall protest backlog, if you will, or the amount of under protest that therefore is not in our backlog is at an all-time high. Having said that, things are moving along, as I said, clients do have the urgency. And so I think over time, some of these will normalize, we're certainly watching closely the, the CR has affected our defense business more than we would have expected and to a degree. I worry about that, but I frankly worry about the impact of the share-on mission and then compounded by the, the COVID PTO and the fact that that Omicron drove a, again, a record number of cases inside Booz Allen. All of that is the volatility that we are talking through, but I take us back to the underlying fundamentals. We are focused on the things our clients are focused on. They are, our backlog is strong, our Book-to-bill for the last 12 months is strong and we're hiring the right people. So we believe that over time, some of these will normalize and we're going to continue focusing on the things we can control. I think it's a, obviously, we're, we're very pleased with both the, the win and the opportunities ahead. And I think to put it in context, right, it, it hits right at the intersection of the, of the type of work we want to do where we're driving, leading edge thinking and leading edge capabilities. We have demonstrated leadership on zero trust across both our commercial and our federal markets. And that is translating into wins across the portfolio. We are excited that we're beginning to see that not just in, more of our, the traditional places where we want that work, but allowing it to to expand further. So I'm as I, I said at the top of the call, we are on strategy, we're winning this kind of work that has great opportunity for us to, expand, to go forward and to help the department and more broadly the federal government transform missions through the use of new technologies. That's what we're all about. And that's what we intend to do. Yeah, Seth, if I would just come back to the, the point that we are very focused on the fundamentals and of the things we can control. We are trying to drive strong growth in the areas where the opportunities are still there. We are hiring the right people, we're winning the right work, we're managing costs. And ultimately we are committed to working hard to drive against our investment thesis and to implement Vault. And I think on that note we are, we're well positioned to continue to drive growth. Yeah, I'll just would stomp the, a point that Lloyd is making -- we are focused on growth and we are driving growth. And while we accept the volatility in the market and we're going to work through it, we are not pulling back from our desire and our ability to, to drive. Obviously if the CR clears that'll be better than if it doesn't, but we are single manly focused on driving this business I think they play to a lot of our strengths. I, if you look at it, there's elements of that that that will strengthen our ability to, to deploy in Cyber 5G, AI Cloud, and even Quantum. So these are all areas that where we believe we built a unique position of leadership and this is why we keep coming back to the fundamentals are strong. And, we don't find ourselves in that sense demand constraint the speed at which these wins get on contract. And then we can put people against them where the, the near-term challenges reside. But, but when you look beyond that, we are aligned with the key priorities of the department and excited to support them. I'm not sure that, that we can do that and as a lot of our work is integrated in a way that it doesn't sit on one specific line item. It really is around our, our support on these core missions. And again, if you look at the missions that are being highlighted and the, the, the type of work that we are winning, that we are doing I, I would point to the fact that there's great convergence of both of those. I'll be brief because we went a little over time. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning I hope this discussion gave you a deeper understanding of the dynamics that are underlying our performance and how we are managing through them. And as a result, why we are confident that we can deliver in both near and long-term financial goals, and that's driven by three things we believe we have the right strategy.

            "content": "Thank you, Horacio. As we near the end of fiscal year, 2022 a year marked by many twists and turns, we have continued to build on our underlying fundamentals, which have supported our expectations for second half performance outpacing first half. And while top line growth and cash did not deliver at the levels we anticipated, we are delivering the bottom line results we need to invest in our business and our people to achieve our long term growth initiatives. With three quarters now completed and greater visibility into the fourth quarter, we are seeing some transitory changes at the macro level that are impacting overall market performance. The expanding on what Horacio said, just as we believe that we were turning the corner on the pandemic's impacts and reverting to more predictable business patterns, we were hit by Omicron, which led to another spike in PTO resulting in staff utilization rates, not normalizing as we had anticipated. This coupled with an overhang effect from the continuing resolution has impacted our ability to convert strong demand into top line growth. We factored some of this uncertainty into our 2022 fiscal year guidance, but we did not fully anticipate the impact of a second wave on utilizing, nor did we foresee the delays in translating wins into revenue generation. I will get into more detail shortly when I give updated guidance. Now for the details of the third quarter, please turn to Slide five. At the top line, revenue increased 6.6% year-over-year to $2 billion, which includes approximately $117 million from inorganic contributions. Revenue, excluding billable expenses grew 6.2% year-over-year to $1.4 billion. Revenue growth was slower this quarter for the following three reasons. First funding delays resulting in slower ramps on new work and existing work. Second, lower staff utilization resulting from an uptick in PTO taken over the holiday period due in part to arise in COVID cases and the inclusion of the New Year's eve holiday in this quarter's results. And third, billable expenses continue to be pressured by slower travel patterns and the timing of material purchases getting pushed to the right. Taken together, these factors are largely timing issues that we believe will dissipate as we return to more normal business rhythms. Now let me walk through the market level performance. Starting with defense, revenue declined by 2.2% year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter. Since defence is roughly 50% of our business portfolio and largely comprised of cost reimbursable work, the macro factors and subsequent top line impacts I noted were especially impactful in this market. More specifically to expand on what Horacio said our army account was hit the hardest by some of these dynamics where our performance was impacted by budgetary challenges, slowness in ramp up and some losses. Going forward, our defense leadership is doubling down on addressing these issues by growing headcount, managing utilization and aggressively deploying talent to capture the value opportunities, including hypergrowth initiatives such as our digital battle space platform. In Civil revenue grew by 25.3% year-over-year of which 5.1% was organic, marking our second consecutive quarter of strong double digit growth. Our results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which are yielding important wins. Additionally, Liberty continues to strengthen our unique market position as we prepare to leverage integrated capabilities in the areas of cloud DevSecOps and API development to pursue additional market share across our broader portfolio. In intelligence, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of growth at 0.8% year over year. This continued improvement in performance reflects our ability to hire ahead of growing demand and capitalize on our mission expertise and advanced technological offerings to secure key recompetes and new work opportunities. This positions us for multiyear growth in key areas, including digital modernization, artificial intelligence, and high end data analytics. Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 26.7% compared to the prior year period. Performance was driven by growing demand in our US commercial cyber business and contributions from Tracepoint where we are seeing strong cross-selling momentum and early synergies. We are now on Slide Six. Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million up 29% over the prior year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12 month book-to-bill of 1.28 times. Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year-over-year to $27.8 billion. Funded backlog grew 11.7% to $4 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 57.7% to $9.4 billion and price options grew 4.4% to $14.3 billion. These results underscore continued demand and strong alignment to our clients' core missions in the areas of artificial intelligence, cyber and digital modernization to name a few and further our position as a trusted partner and market leader. Looking ahead, as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids, we anticipate that ongoing protest will become part of the normal business cycle, which we are increasingly factoring into our operating plan. Pivoting to headcount, as of December 31, we had approximately 29,500 employees, an increase of approximately 1900 year-over-year or 6.8%. The labor market for tech and tech adjacent talent remains highly competitive, but we are pleased that we continue to successfully execute on our hiring and retention strategies, a reflection of our appeal as an employer of choice. This resulted in a third consecutive quarter of mid-single digit headcount growth, consistent with our expectations. Moving to the bottom line, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million up 8% from the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 10.9% compared to 10.8% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by three factors. First, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions. Second, prudent cost management, and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $2 million negative impact on the prior year period under the Cares Act, a tailwind that will taper off after this quarter. Third quarter net income decreased 10.8% year-over-year to $129 million. Adjusted net income was $137 million down 5.5% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.8% to $0.95 from $1.03 the prior year period and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $1.02 from $1.04. Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense, partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program. Our non-GAAP metrics exclude certain acquisition costs and the non-cash gain of $7.1 million from the spinoff of SnapAttack during the quarter. Turning to cash, cash from operations was $21 million in the third quarter down from $233 million in the prior year comparable period. Operating cash performance is volatile a quarter to quarter and the decline this period was more pronounced due to some of the factors impacting top line growth, coupled with higher disbursements. As we have done before, we are focused on our working cash management and cash collection efforts to continue improving our operating cash performance and reinforce our strong balance sheet. Year to date, we have generated $481 million in operating cash flow and $430 million in free cash for a free cash conversion rate, nearing 100% supporting our strong balance sheet positioning and capital deployment priorities. Please turn to Slide Seven. During the quarter, we deployed approximately $139 million inclusive of $50 million in quarterly dividends and $83 million in share repurchases. Today we are also pleased to announce that the board has increased our quarterly dividends by $0.06 to $0.43 per share payable on March 2 to stockholders of record on February 11. This marks our ninth consecutive fiscal year of increasing our quarterly dividend, a testament to our fundamental strength and promise to continue growing our dividend even in a more challenging operating environment. With one quarter left in this fiscal year, we remain committed to a patient, disciplined capital allocation strategy, leveraging our strong balance sheet position to deploy capital in an accretive manner, creating near and long term shareholder value. As we have said in October, our capital deployment priorities remain focused on strategic M&A to enhance growth while sustaining a healthy dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares. Let me now walk you through how the puts and takes from the quarter translate into updates to our full year fiscal 2022 guidance. Please move to Slide Eight. Despite lighter revenue and operating cash challenges this quarter, we are proud of our team's efforts to manage the business controlling what we can in spite of another wave of macro environmental challenges. These efforts have enabled margin expansion with solid ADIP's performance throughout this fiscal year as we reinforce the strength of our fundamentals and balance sheet in preparation to execute on our investment thesis. In the fourth quarter, we are laser focused on executing against our operational priorities. We will continue to aggressively hire ahead of demand capitalizing on our strong portfolio of new work opportunities to sustain long term organic growth. We will efficiently manage the business by investing in our people and technology to lead the next wave of innovation. And lastly, continue to build our M&A pipeline and acquire businesses that meet our disciplined criteria to serve as strategic accelerators. Our revised guidance reflects these efforts. In addition to the third quarter performance and trends I just outlined, let me run through the numbers. For the full fiscal year, revenue growth is now expected to be in the range of 5.7% to 7.2%. At the midpoint, our revised guidance range reflects $100 million to $220 million of revenues tied to the uncertainties we outlined earlier. They break down as follows. $30 million to $80 million tied to funding delays and resulting slowness in deploying staff unsold and funded work. $20 million to $40 million tied to an incremental step down in staff utilization due largely to the continuing pandemic in PTO usage and $50 million to $100 million from lower pandemic related travel and the timing of materials purchase getting pushed to the right. As a reminder, the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday and minor differences in the costing of labor related to the implementation of our NextGen financial management system will become tailwinds in the fourth quarter, adding roughly 175 basis points to the top line. On the bottom line, we now expect adjusted EBITDA margin for the fiscal year to be approximately 11%. This increase reflects our considerable control over our cost structure and margin levers even in times of uncertainty. We are reaffirming our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be between $4.10 and $4.30. The a ADIP's guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24%, $134 million to $137 million weighted average shares outstanding and interest expense of $92 million to $95 million. We now expect operating cash to be between $700 million and $750 million. The incremental step down follows our expectations for lower top line growth and accounts for the $56 million of one time payments in connection with the Liberty acquisition, which we had anticipated, being able to make up through a combination of working capital management and operating performance. As I mentioned, we will remain laser focused on optimizing our working capital to return to the strong level of cash version we have historically delivered to position us ahead of future growth initiatives. And finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $100 million. As we move towards our investment thesis, I remain confident in our team's ability to manage through these times of uncertainty as we have proven our ability to do over the years. We will continue to execute on our near term growth objectives and remain competent in the long term trajectory of the business, upholding our role as the industry leader and meeting the high standards our shareholders have come to expect. With that over to you, Laura. Yeah, I'll start. So Sheila, as we said, our prepared remarks, it's a combination of three factors that have us in that 2% to 4%, the funding delays, the lower staff utilization and lower billable expenses. That being said, we're laser focused on the things that are in our control. We said that our operational priority was bringing in talent and we're doing that 3.6 year over year, organic and 6.8 year-over-year overall. We're winning work. Our backlog is up 19% year-over-year. Latest our trailing 12 months at 1.28 times. So we're winning work that we want to win. We're engaged with our clients on topics that are forward leaning, but we do face these challenges and we feel that the path through this volatility is really to focus on the things that are in our control, which is winning work and hiring the best talent. Kevin, I would just add like yourself. I had a dejavu moment as well, because many of the dynamics that we were grappling with a year ago and we're still grappling with. I think, we expected that in early October, things were going to open up again along, came Omicron and definitely had an impact on our workforce. We expected that this far into the administration that things would start to flow, but we're still seeing slowness and ramp up and, and kicking off things, and that's just the environment we're in now. We're not making excuses. Like Horacio and I have said, we are focused on the operational items that are in our control. It's playing out with strong bottom line results which we're very proud about but we're going to have choppiness at the top line and we're just going to keep staying on strategy and executing as well as we have up to this point. Yeah, we're not managing to mid 10s. In fact we're very pleased with 10.9% for this quarter because really, it speaks to our operational performance, our discipline around cost control and solid fundamentals and we have an expectation of ourselves to continue that going forward. The raise to approximately 11% is a reality of that, that we're seeing really good mid shift in terms of our contract types. The discipline that we've had we're going to stay focused on that as well as the core business fundamentals that we've talked about and given that volatility that we're experiencing. So that's what we're moving to. That's why we're confident about around been for the full year. But it's really the fundamentals that we've been focused on that's gotten us to 10.9% at this point. Yeah. Matt, cash definitely was lighter due to some of the headwinds we talked about in revenue, but specifically around cash, we had lower collections. Some of that was just due to revenue being a little bit lower funding delays, the near celebration falling Q3. The same time we had higher disbursements and payroll expense. So, the incremental impacts about $35 million of collection slipped increase in payroll expense. That being said we're still focused on a 100% cash conversion for the year. And I also sort of offer the following context, this year we had the Liberty acquisition as well as added interest from the June bond issuance and that's kind of offset some of the operational improvements that we've made. And that being said, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're laser focused on this. We expect it to improve going forward as we sort of work through these near-term headwinds, if you will. Hey Cai, I would just add that for the most part, our Book-to-bill pattern is consistent, 0.3, nine times for this quarter is comparable to what we saw last year at this point. And in trailing 12 months of 1.28 to Tracepoint. We feel is pretty plenty strength and demand signal. We are still going to see volatility though, some of these larger procurements as they come through, depending upon protest resolution timing which certainly is moving all over the place, is going to continue to impact the traditional pattern of our Book-to-bill. But we're winning incumbent work at 90%, new work to grow 60%. So, on the demand signals, we, we're still feeling pretty good. 0 Yeah, we to, I think Matt's question we're focused on, getting it down. It's a function of really being diligent and disciplined on collections; really continuing to balance that out with our disbursements. And the team's on it. Cash will be volatile, in this current environment, but we expect to see improvement it going forward. So, no excuses we're on it. And I expect that we'll, we'll do better going forward. So, I, I think looking at our M&A strategy, it's consistent with Vault and with all the things that we have said, we're looking to deploy between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion between now and 2025, with a focus on things that can be strategic accelerators for us. So are there positions technologies, unique opportunities to move faster, to develop things faster Liberty and Tracepoints were really good examples of that. And we're building a pipeline of opportunities that really mirrors that it's either a unique technology or a technology mission intersection that really accelerates on our priorities. And especially around either national cyber or digital battle space, we're going to be very diligent and very assertive in terms of generating that pipeline. Liberty is done, very well since the acquisition. It's, it's a good, the integration is going well. The teams have found lots of points of touch, where we are working together, both in their core markets around health and beginning to expand across other parts of our portfolio from a COVID CR. And so forth, they reflect the rest of the business and they are because they're more civil oriented, they're seeing more of the dynamics that we see in the civil market, as opposed to the, the, the more difficult dynamics we saw most recently in defense. But I think they're, again, they're a great team. They're a great acquisition for us and they're a pattern for us to continue to follow. I -- they don't have much to add, but your question around sort of backlog to right ride through some of the, the short term cycles, obviously when we're doing due diligence, it's a variety of areas we're looking at - talent, pipeline positioning, you name it. So it's certainly in the mix, but to Tracepoint, we're not leading with that. It's still, is it on strategy, our confidence on integration it's adherence to Vault and achieving of our updated investment thesis. But yeah, for sure, we're looking at what upside do does a Company have strengthen their talent and the list goes on and on. Yeah, Liberty was a little over a hundred million it's ahead of our annualized Tracepoint north of 300, probably less than 350 Tracepoint added 12 million. So we're pleased with how well both integrations are going really winning new work already head of pace, great integration with both Companies. So, those things I think are definitely contributing to the financial outcomes and contributions we're seeing. Yeah, I mean, Seth, we're not going to get into me giving guidance for '23, but I will say normally at this year when we're updating guide guidance, I'm narrowing it. And I think because of many of the factors that are contributing to the volatility I think it's a pretty obvious it it's a challenge to do that. So with the headwinds that we articulate that we're working, on with the range of five, seven to seven two we feel pretty confident that we're going to end up in that range. And it really points back to what we need to continue to be focused on, which is bringing the talent and getting them utilized is as fast as possible. And I think those fundamentals gives us confidence that we're going to build the momentum in Q4, and it's going to carry over into '23 as to what that range in '23 is going to be let me get to that in May, but at this point we're feeling good about our guidance for this fiscal year. I wish -- I wish I could do that, but I think if anything, we've learned over the last two years, speculating on that isn't a great move, like we're playing the game for what we can see and then chipping away at it to get the successes. We had growth in the second half, we are growing and it's really back to the fundamentals that are giving us strong bottom-line performance. But this is here to stay and, and we're on top of it or that great team pointed out this prepared remarks and everyone's pulling as hard as they can. I'd also remind you that, that what we did share is that we are focused on EBITDA dollar growth as a part of our investment thesis, and we believe we're on track to deliver on that."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Booz Allen Hamilton's earnings call covering second quarter results for fiscal year 2022. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Lloyd Howell, Executive Vice President, CFO and Treasurer of Booz Allen Hamilton. \nLloyd Howell: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Announcement. As some of you know, our Head of Investor Relations, Rubun Day, recently left the company to pursue other opportunities. We thank him for his contributions and wish him well. \n Our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Laura Adams, has stepped in as Interim Head of Investor Relations, which she will oversee while also maintaining her ongoing role. Laura has been a finance executive with the firm for over a decade, overseeing many areas of corporate finance, including governance, financial and treasury oversight and risk mitigation. She has played a vital role for me and our leadership team in our strategic decision-making around our capital allocation and M&A plans and our investment thesis more recently. \n With that, I turn the call over to Laura. \nLaura Adams: Thank you, Lloyd, for that introduction. I'm excited to support the team and get to know our valued investors and analysts even more. \n And good morning, everyone. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. And we have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. \n As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning will include statements that may be considered forward-looking and therefore, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Those risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general economic conditions, the availability of government funding for our company's services and other factors discussed in today's earnings release and set forth under the forward-looking statements disclaimer included in our second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release and in our SEC filings. We caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements that we may make today and remind you that we assume no obligation to update or revise the information discussed on this call. \n During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2022 slides. \n It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. \n Laura, it's great to have you play a more public role on these calls because you have been a leader on our finance team and integral to the quarterly earnings process for many years. I have personally relied on your expertise for as long as I've been CEO. So welcome to the call, Laura, and thank you for taking on this extra responsibility on an interim basis. \n And everyone, thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I, along with several of our Booz Allen colleagues, were excited to be in New York City earlier this month to share our new investment thesis and our strategy for growth. It was great to see so many of you in person, and we hope you took away from that event a deeper understanding of our strategy, business and multiyear financial goals. \n Today, we will continue the conversation in the context of our second quarter results for the fiscal year. And we will show how Booz Allen is already setting up to accelerate into the financial goals described in our investment thesis. I'm also pleased to share an update on our future work rollout. \n Before diving into the second quarter results, I want to briefly recap a few points from our Investor Day, starting with VoLT: Velocity, Leadership and Technology. VoLT is the strategic framework that will accelerate our growth and create exceptional shareholder value. Through VoLT, we will capitalize on future market opportunities and leverage our positioning to deploy talent and capital against the nation's highest priorities. \n As part of our new strategy, we also told you about the opportunities we see for hyper growth in the areas of digital battle space and national cyber, among others. \n And then those of you who attended AUSA a week later saw some of our differentiated technology solutions that are transforming national missions. Specifically, demos of Rainmaker and a few of our edge solutions are excellent examples of how we are leading in our market. \n Fueled by the investments we have made during Vision 2020, Booz Allen holds first-mover advantage at key intersections of technology and mission. \n The overall strategy is important because it's what creates our strong financial performance year-to-year. And on Investor Day, we were pleased to present our new investment thesis. It's the multiyear outlook that will frame our quarter-to-quarter performance going forward. \n At the core of these theses is accelerating growth in adjusted EBITDA dollars through fiscal year 2025. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Broadly, we expect this increase to be driven by above-market organic revenue growth, continued strong margins and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. \n To be more specific, our path to 50% adjusted EBITDA growth includes financial expectations of 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment during the period. \n The leadership team and I are confident that we can accelerate growth and achieve the goals in our investment thesis. We have the right strategy. And more importantly, the right team is in place to drive our business. This quarter's results demonstrate that Booz Allen is already positioned for acceleration. \n So let me shift now to an overview of the second quarter. As we have said since fiscal year 2022 began, this year's growth pattern looks different from recent fiscal years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration expected in the second half. This pattern is primarily due to 3 factors: first and most important, a ramp-up in hiring; second, productivity and time of dynamics tied to the pandemic that create challenging comps in the first half; and third, full inclusion of revenue from acquisitions. These factors contribute to choppiness at the top line. And with our second quarter results now final, you can see that the first half of the fiscal year played out just as we expected. \n For the full 6 months, revenue growth was in the low single digits. We are pleased to report that across bottom line metrics, we outperformed in the first half, with strong profit margins driving EBITDA and ADEPS growth. Book-to-bill for the second quarter was strong, reflecting a significant year-over-year increase in bookings. And cash generation was exceptional. \n Our latest results demonstrate several key things about our business at the midpoint of the fiscal year. We are not demand-constrained, as shown in our backlog and book-to-bill performance. \n Hiring, which is our top operational priority, rapidly accelerated over the first 2 quarters. We continue to attract and retain the talent we need in a very competitive market and we aim to keep our momentum going. \n Our team is managing the business extraordinarily well, which can be seen especially in the bottom line metrics. We are well underway with making strategic acquisitions and successfully integrating them, with our acquisition of Tracepoint last month being the most recent example. \n I am excited to welcome the Tracepoint team to Booz Allen. We're already seeing a lift from combining Tracepoint's channel access and incident response expertise with Booz Allen's cyber consulting and managed services offerings. And while we did face headwinds from comps and a slow ramp-up on some contracts, we continue to manage through them. \n Taken together, our first half results and the strong operational performance behind them point to acceleration through the rest of the fiscal year. To achieve our second half objectives, we are focused on a set of priorities that are critical to our success. Let me walk through them. \n Our top priority remains recruiting. We must continue strong hiring to execute our growing backlog. Second, we will maintain operational excellence in managing the business. Third, we will continue to capture key market opportunities. Fourth, we will capitalize on the upside presented by our acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. And fifth, we will continue to invest in our people and differentiated solutions to drive growth beyond this fiscal year. \n Lloyd and I are confident Booz Allen will continue to make progress on these objectives. And today, we are pleased to reaffirm guidance for the full fiscal year. We believe that our growing momentum will both deliver another successful year and accelerate our business into the years covered by our new investment thesis. \n Lloyd will share more details on our results and fiscal year 2022 guidance in a few minutes. Before giving him the floor, I want to provide an update on the implementation of our future of work program. As you may recall, we believe we can offer our people increased flexibility in the way we work, with the expectation that many of our people will work in a hybrid model, a mix of telework and purposeful in-person collaboration. \n We have plans to launch future of work and reopen all our offices on September 7. But those plans have to be delayed. It just was not safe at the time, given the summer wave of COVID driven by the Delta variant. \n Since then, case metrics have improved and we are implementing a vaccination policy consistent with the federal governance mandate, requirements and time line. We're making excellent progress in our vaccination rates. And earlier this month, we began a phased reopening of offices that have remained closed, and we expect to have all offices open by November 22. \n We are excited to now be in the position to safely engage more broadly with clients and colleagues in person. Our people did an extraordinary job staying connected over the past 19 months. But just like Investor Day, there are times when being face-to-face is best. Our future of work program provides the flexibility to come together with purpose, when and where it makes the most sense. \n With the opportunity to see more of our teams, clients, investors and other Booz Allen stakeholders in person, I am feeling energized and confident about the future. And my optimism is enhanced by the strong performance we delivered in the first half and how it sets us up for acceleration for the rest of the fiscal year and well beyond. \n And with that, Lloyd, over to you to take us through the financials in depth. \nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and hello again. Before I speak through our latest results, I want to add my thanks again to those who were able to join us just a few weeks ago in New York City for Investor Day. A recording of the webcast is available at investors.boozallen.com. \n Our overall objective with Investor Day was to once again demonstrate Booz Allen's commitment to long-term profitable growth. Leveraging our VoLT strategy, we will make the internal investments and strategic acquisitions required to drive and execute that growth. \n In our view, the first half of fiscal year 2022 was an inflection point. As we move into the second half of the fiscal year and move past the direct and indirect influences of COVID over the last 19 months, we are entering the next leg of the firm's multiyear journey. \n As Horacio noted, we closed out the first half of the fiscal year with top line performance in line with our expectations and prior guidance and with bottom line performance well ahead. This gives us great confidence in our plan for the full fiscal year. Our large backlog, strong bookings and proposal activity signals continued client interest and strong demand for our work. Our hiring engine is now firing on all cylinders, positioning us to drive growth in the second half of the fiscal year. We closed on the acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. \n As we have noted, we anticipated early year choppiness in our top line results as we move into a post-COVID operating rhythm, which played out as we expected. Our strong balance sheet position and favorable market conditions have allowed us to take advantage of a number of opportunities, including attractive levels of debt financing, M&A and share repurchases. \n As a reminder, we had forecast constrained low single-digit top line growth in the first half, with an acceleration through the fiscal year, driven by 3 dynamics: a ramp-up in contracts and hiring; normalizing staff utilization and time-off usage, growing contributions from acquisitions. I will speak to these in more detail when I address our guidance. \n With that, let me walk you through the second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 5. \n At the top line, in the second quarter, revenue increased 4.3% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 3.6% to $1.5 billion. Revenue growth was driven by inorganic contributions and solid operational performance, offset from higher-than-normal staff utilization in the comparable prior year period. \n Now let me step through performance at the market level. In defense, revenue declined by 0.6%, primarily due to a significant material purchase in billable expenses and unusually high staff utilization in the prior year period, a headwind felt throughout most of our markets. Defense also saw some slowness in ramp-ups on both new and existing work, while ongoing protests continue to create uncertainty on the timing of program starts. In the first 6 months, revenue increased 1.8%. \n In civil, revenue grew by 16.4%, led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of Liberty. Liberty's contribution so far is slightly outpacing our previously forecasted range of $300 million to $340 million of annualized revenue. We remain exceptionally pleased with Liberty's performance and contribution to Booz Allen and are well underway with plans to fully integrate it with our broader health and digital business. We are feeling momentum across this entire market as we continue to capture key opportunities aligned to the government's priorities. In the first 6 months, revenue increased 11.2%. \n In intelligence, we recorded 0.8% revenue growth this quarter. Our portfolio-reshaping efforts have started to yield critical wins, and we are excited to see this business return to growth. For the full first 6 months, revenue declined 2.9%, but we believe this will continue to turn around in the second half of the fiscal year. \n Lastly, revenue in global commercial declined 5.7% compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to strategically shift focus to our U.S. commercial cyber business and anticipate growth in the back half of the fiscal year as we accelerate hiring to capitalize on the strong demand and additive growth in the business from Tracepoint. In the first 6 months, revenue declined 17.2%. \n Please turn to Slide 6. Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 2.03x, while our last 12 months' book-to-bill was 1.28x. Total backlog grew 18% year-over-year, resulting in backlog of $29 billion, a new record. Funded backlog grew 9.7% to $4.9 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 54.7% to $9.5 billion. And priced options grew 4.4% to $14.6 billion. We are proud of our bookings performance in the second quarter which continues to demonstrate we are not demand-constrained and our ability to win and convert on work aligned with our core capabilities and clients' most critical missions. \n Pivoting to headcount. As of September 30, we had approximately 29,200 employees, up by about 1,600 year-over-year, or 5.8%. In the first half of the fiscal year, we added approximately 1,500 employees. \n As we have previously noted, the competition for talent, particularly technical talent, remains fierce. Still, we have successfully executed our hiring and retention strategies. As Betty Thompson highlighted at Investor Day, those strategies focused on fostering a strong people-centered culture and effective talent systems that support individual pursuits as well as business needs. \n Accelerating headcount growth remains a top operational priority for this fiscal year and will be key as we move into the next multiyear period of our investment thesis. We expect to continue building on our progress through the second half of the fiscal year. \n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $270 million, up 18.1% from the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 12.8% compared to 11.3% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by 3 factors: first, profitable contract level performance and mix which includes the inorganic contributions into our results; second, prudent cost management; and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $7 million negative impact on the prior year period under the CARES Act. \n As we move through the fiscal year, we expect billable expenses and unallowable spends to ramp up, with billable expenses, which are currently near the low end of our historical 29% to 31% range, expected to move towards the midpoint of that range by the fiscal year end. \n Second quarter net income increased 14% year-over-year to $155 million. Adjusted net income was $170 million, up 19% from the prior year period, primarily driven by the same factors driving higher adjusted EBITDA. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.14 from $0.98 the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.26 from $1.03. These increases to our non-GAAP metrics were primarily driven by better operating performance, the inclusion of Liberty, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count due to our share repurchase program. \n Turning to cash. Cash from operations was $470 million in the second quarter compared to $426 million in the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by continued strong cash management, fueled by consistent operational performance. \n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior year period, driven by investments for future growth. We still expect capital expenditures to land within our forecast range for the fiscal year. \n Please turn to Slide 7. During the quarter, we paid out $50 million for our quarterly dividend and repurchased $106 million worth of shares at an average price of $83.31 per share. We also acquired the remaining stake in Tracepoint, a promising digital forensics and incident response business. As you may recall, we took a minority stake in Tracepoint last December and the partnership has proven so fruitful that we completed the purchase in September. In total, including the close of the Tracepoint acquisition, we deployed $285 million during the quarter. \n Today, we are announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 15. As our actions and performance demonstrate we remain committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through a disciplined balance capital allocation posture. \n Turning now to guidance, please move to Slide 8. Before I address the numbers, I want to highlight our continued expectations for a distinct first half, second half dynamics this fiscal year. Let me walk through the puts and takes of this second half ramp, starting with the top line perspective. \n First, we expect year-over-year comparables and staff utilization to normalize in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, in fiscal year 2021, staff utilization trended roughly 300 basis points above typical levels in the first half of the year before starting to normalize in the third quarter. \n Second, we expect that our ramp on both contracts and hiring will translate into growth as we move through the fiscal year. Strong customer interest and proactive demand signals give us confidence that any near-term slowness in the acquisition process is likely temporary, notwithstanding any unforeseen disruptions in government funding. On the other hand, from a supply perspective, our efforts to improve hiring, in some cases ahead of demand, have paid off. \n Third, our growing Liberty business will fully contribute in the second half of the fiscal year relative to a partial first half. \n Lastly, minor timing differences in our costing of labor, resulting from the implementation of our new financial management systems. \n Putting it all together, we still forecast significant acceleration from our first half performance ramping through the fourth quarter, barring any major disruptions such as a prolonged government shutdown or other dynamics outside of our control. \n Regarding adjusted EBITDA margins, we exercised considerable control over our cost structure and margin levers. We traditionally take a conservative approach to cost management early in the fiscal year and prioritize investments in our people, infrastructure and long-term growth objectives as we move throughout the fiscal year. Given the slowness we noted in the government's contracting process, we have maintained a tighter grip on our cost levers into this fiscal year. However, we still expect to make those same investments in the second half of the fiscal year, which will pressure back half adjusted EBITDA margins. \n Taking these factors into consideration, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be between 7% and 10%, inclusive of Liberty and Tracepoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-10% range. Let me reiterate that we expect to make investments in our people and our technology in the second half of the fiscal year to support our multiyear growth aspirations. That said, given our strong first half results, we expect to finish near the top end of our current guidance. \n We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30 based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24%, 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding and interest expense of $92 million to $95 million. \n We expect operating cash flow near the low end of our prior $800 million to $850 million range, which is inclusive of approximately $56 million of cash payments related to the Liberty transaction. \n And finally, we expect CapEx in the $80 million to $100 million range. \n Finally, I would like to round out the conversation by looking to the future and our new investment thesis, which Horacio recapped in his remarks. As we continue to position ourselves for a post-COVID operating environment, we believe that our actions and performance throughout the remainder of fiscal year '22 will put us on the right trajectory to accelerate our growth and execute on our investment thesis. We are truly excited for the future of this firm and all we can accomplish for both our clients and our investors. \n With that, Laura, let's open the lines for questions. \nLaura Adams: Thank you, Lloyd. Operator, please open the line. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Horacio and Lloyd, and welcome Laura. I wanted to ask first about revenue growth. It's trending up 3% in H1 and 1% organically, implying 14% growth in the second half and 10% organic. Horacio, you mentioned 3 significant accelerators, one which was ramp-up in hiring and two, some of the acquisition contribution. So I wanted to ask about those 2 items. If we think about the ramp-up in hiring, I think it's up about 4% organically in the quarter. How quickly -- what should be we looking for when it comes to headcount? How quickly are employees revenue generators? \n And then as a follow-up to that, on the acquisition contribution, maybe can you talk a little bit about Tracepoint and how much it adds? On our calculation, it's about $80 million if we use the same multiple as Liberty. \nLloyd Howell: So Sheila, let me start to unpack those questions. On the revenue front, we're pleased that the growth is in line with our expectations and positions us for acceleration in the second half. \n I think what's important is there are about 3 reasons that we're confident. One is that the ramp-up and improvement in our recruiting and hiring, as Horacio and I said in previous calls, this is the operational priority. And with a first half adding 1,500 folks this year, up just under 6% year-over-year, particularly in a very tight job market, we're very pleased with that part of our operations kicking in. We're not done. With an eye toward the balance of the year, we've got to maintain that pace. But as Betty shared with everyone at Investor Day, we're feeling really confident about that. \n The second point is that we're kind of in an apples and orange kind of comparison this year. The productivity and the time off dynamics last year, people weren't taking any time off. Our productivity was through the roof. And by our estimation, that's about a 400, 450 basis point headwind. So if you take the growth that we had this quarter and you were to add to that, we're in the mid-single digits which keeps us on pace for why we're confident in the second half of the year. \n And then the third point, I would add is that we're going to get the full inclusion of revenue from the acquisitions that we've made. Liberty is off to a great start. The integration is going very well. We've won some significant procurements together. And we just see that continuing. \n And then I'll finish sort of my part of the response, because you probably have to remind me of the other parts of your question, but when you look at our backlog, book-to-bill, 2.03x for this quarter trailing 12 months to 1.28x. As we've always said, we don't feel demand-constrained especially when the backlog is up 18% to an all-time record of $29 billion. \n So we've got the supply side underway. The demand signals are strong. We're working through, as you heard in our prepared comments, some timing issues in some parts of the portfolio. But overall, we believe we're on pace for an acceleration in the second half. \nHoracio Rozanski: Sheila, I'll add a couple of thoughts to what Lloyd just talked about and in this school of thought around acceleration of momentum. As Lloyd pointed out, there's a number of reasons why the numbers almost get better by comparison as we go into the second half. But what we're sensing and that has us confidence and optimistic is real momentum in the business. I think you can see it in the book-to-bill. I'll tell you the pipeline is really strong. And it's not just strong in terms of the numbers, it's the type of work that we described in both as being the next wave of growth for Booz Allen. And it's aligned to these key mission technology intersections where we see hyper growth. And so we believe that the work that we can show you in the quarter, plus the work that is coming, all positions us well, not just for the balance of this year, but against these 5 to 8 revenue -- organic revenue and the investment thesis through 2025 and beyond. \nLloyd Howell: Sheila, you had second part... \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: That's okay. I was on Tracepoint, how do we think about the total revenue contribution for Tracepoint, given it was a minority interest? And I think you guys spent $114 million in the quarter on that? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. At this point, it's really not that material. We're excited about the transaction with the simple fact that this is a high-demand area, particularly for our global commercial clients, but in this part of the journey, it's really not material. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. \nGavin Parsons: Lloyd, you gave a lot of color on margins and why we might expect those to decline in the second half of the year, but you kind of just keeping your margins -- keep driving margins higher. I appreciate that the multiyear outlook had a lot of detail and we talked a lot about it at the Investor Day, but when does that trend just kind of start heading downward? Is there a step function at some point? Or is that kind of flat over time through the Investor Day target? And it certainly doesn't seem like you're underinvesting, but are you overearning in any certain areas? Just any more color on that would be great. \nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean, right out of the gate, we've had solid operational performance, and I think our margin performance is indicative of that. There are a couple of things I'd point to in terms of what's happening structurally. \n One is that as we're emerging from the pandemic, things that have going into it been very strong was profitable contract level performance, and that has maintained over the past 18 months. And I think that's been a tailwind to our margin. \n Number two is we're now seeing the contributions from our inorganic transactions, more fixed-price work, particularly when you're looking at what Liberty has brought to the game. \n And over the past several years, we've had a real prudent cost management set of initiatives underway. And I think across the portfolio, all of that has kicked in and is really institutionalized. \n For this period, we've also had some unique, what I call, contributions. One is now we have the ability to bill for fee in the Intel market. The timing of unallowable spend, which gets, I think, to your trend question, we expect to start to pick up in the back half of this year. \n And we've probably repeatedly talked about billable expenses and the fact that they've been low versus historical norms. And you heard in our prepared remarks that we're expecting that to kind of pick up move into the middle of the range. \n So on a trending perspective, we see it beginning, in terms of spending, to pick up in the back half of the year. We'll probably see that it will come back a bit due to some of our investment activity. But as you know, in the back half of Booz Allen, we usually are investing in our people, our infrastructure, getting ready for the next fiscal year. \nHoracio Rozanski: Gavin, if I can just expand a little bit and connect this conversation to our Investor Day discussion, I think what you're seeing, if you look at the trends over the last couple of years, is that the margin potential in this business continues to improve as a result of the work that we're doing, our differentiation in the market. And frankly, this is a time to brag about the team, just the operational performance keeps getting better and better even in light of some really challenging conditions all around us. \n And what I think is impressive about the last 18 months is we've managed to drive margins, while at the same time, we invested our people. If you remember, we set a high $100 million for pandemic response. We did a lot of employee welfare work, especially around mental health over the last year. And a number of other things that position us well to continue to be an employer of choice and be able to drive the talent into the business that we need to achieve our goals. \n So as Lloyd pointed out at Investor Day, what we have in front of us is real margin potential and the ability to invest in our business intelligently, as the opportunities present themselves, to continue to drive both top and bottom line growth. \nGavin Parsons: Got it. I appreciate all that detail. And maybe just if you could give a little bit more color on the delays of the DoD starts that you referenced in the prepared remarks. \nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean it's as frustrating to us as, I think, to anyone. I think in our defense market, a couple of dynamics. One is we continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. And the demand for our services continues to accelerate a lot of our client urgency around modernization, as Karen spoke to during our Investor Day and the Joint Warfighter. \n We've got, again, a tough comp to Q2 of last year, where productivity is at all-time high. That being said, we've won really good work, but the ramp-up has been slower than expected. We're expecting in the second half of this year for that to pick up. There's no indications from our clients that they intend for that dynamic to persist. So we're working our way through it. And we've also got some larger opportunities that we're expecting to come in, in the back half of this year as well. \nHoracio Rozanski: I mean everything we're hearing from clients, and I spent a lot of time with clients at AUSA, I spent time with clients really over the past 6 months, with a lot of plans across the board, not just in defense. But in particular, defense clients see the work that we're doing in digital battle space as absolutely a priority for great power competition and for what's to come. And so while it is true that things now are a little slower than they would like and we would like, we're doing great in terms of driving those businesses, and we expect momentum to accelerate. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. \nUnknown Analyst: It's actually [ Eric Gain ] on for Matt. Just wondering what drove the big uptick in fixed price contract mix during the quarter. Is that [ a single ] from here? And could that drive margins higher? \nLloyd Howell: Yes, Matt. It's really a function of Liberty coming into the portfolio. They've been doing great. Clients have been very pleased. We've also seen some upside potential there, which would sort of provide some tailwind to the margin. We've got strong contractual performance across the portfolio. So a combination of that plus Liberty is the dynamic. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. If I could do one more. Just quickly on M&A. What are you seeing for valuations in the current market and how competitive you think the deals are? \nHoracio Rozanski: Maybe I'll start with this one just to switch up the pattern. As we talked about at Investor Day, our posture in M&A is to look for opportunities that are strategic accelerators to our business. And that is becoming a central plank of VoLT and in some ways a bit of a difference from our prior approach. And Tracepoint is a great example of that. Liberty is a great example of that. Albeit small, our investment in Latent AI a while back is a great example of strategic acceleration. And so that's the goal. \n Underneath that, it's a very competitive market. It's challenging to find the right things that will give us strategic acceleration. What we're seeing is some of the uniqueness of Booz Allen that makes us attractive to clients and to talent. Actually reflects also well as being attractive in the acquisition arena, where we're able to potentially have better discussions, more relationship-based discussions, and reach a mutually agreeable win-win-type scenario, even in the light of some overheated evaluations that are operating around us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. \nCai Von Rumohr: Terrific. So I have a 2-part question about revenue growth, 2 issues. One is the impact of PTO and what that might be going forward. And I bring that up because Northrop on its call mentioned a higher PTO in the quarter, but [ it said ] expected it to go back to normal, so that, that was sort of a negative this quarter, but it should be better next quarter. \n And the second question is on organic growth. I mean you gave it for the full year at 4% to 7%. You didn't repeat it this time. You gave it at Investor Day. I mean if Liberty is really doing better than expected, I would have guessed that organic growth was 0 and revenues, ex billables, excluding inorganic growth, would have been minus 2%. Is that essentially correct? And what is the organic growth target for this year? \nLloyd Howell: So Cai, let me pick up your first comment regarding PTO. We expect the impact, by our estimate, to be around 400 basis points to start to mitigate in the second half. So I would be supportive of what Northrop said or shared in terms of it over time starting to normalize. I think we're all watching it closely. Our workforce's PTO balances is elevated, obviously, because folks haven't been going on. We have a program in place to manage that and track it, but we would expect that, that will start to normalize going forward. \n In terms of organic growth, no purposeful oversight or reason why we didn't repeat it, but we still remain 4% to 7%, given that we've had a nice pickup in headcount, as I've always shared with you, that with inflation on top of it puts us comfortably in that range for the year. \n And we've also said that we expected the first half to be low single digits. And the organic component of that, I think it's tracking. And we expect that to accelerate in the second half. \n So again, some moving pieces here, but all consistent with what we expected, and we still remain confident about the guidance for the full year. \nCai Von Rumohr: So you're saying PTO was a 400 basis point impact to revenues this quarter, and it should diminish in the second half. Is that essentially correct? \nLloyd Howell: That's correct, Cai. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. \nTobey Sommer: I was wondering if you could give us some comments on some of the HR things that you're doing to stem the tide of turnover to continue to attract talent. \nHoracio Rozanski: Tobey, happy to do that. And I think I'm going to try and do justice to Betty Thompson's really excellent conversation about this at Investor Day. But I would put this in really 3 categories. And again, I mean, I think the numbers bear out what we're saying. The increase in headcount over the first half is the combination of we are not seeing this great resignation wave that people are talking about. In fact, our attrition rate is at or below what we had forecasted for the year and really strong hiring. And it's not just what we're -- as you know, we're bringing in technical talent, we're bringing the highly clear talent. We're bringing the kind of talent we need to execute against our strategy. \n And I would put the -- what we're doing and why it's working in 3 categories. The first one, which Betty really talked about at length is the combination of our culture, our focus on diversity and the work we've done over the last 1.5 years to keep our workforce safe and keep our workforce productive and engaged is clearly paying dividends in our value proposition and our brand in the talent market. \n The second one is where there's internal and external excitement about our future of work program. We can't wait to really get that rolling. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had to delay the rollout by about 1 month, 1.5 months to accommodate the realities of the Delta wave. And I am not one to try to predict the sort of the course of the pandemic going forward, but I'm optimistic and we're getting going, and hopefully we'll have all of our facilities open under the new future of work protocol right around Thanksgiving. \n And the third one, which I think is really important, especially as it relates to technical talent, is the type of work that we're both doing and we're investing in under VoLT is the work that is most exciting to type of talent we're trying to attract, right? The ability to bring AI to a core national mission gives us an opportunity to attract AI talent on par with any technology company out there. We may have deeper pockets, but don't have access to the passion that these missions represent for people. So if you look across all 3 of those, I think this explains why we had a good first half on hiring, but I think it also explains why we're optimistic about having momentum in the future. \nTobey Sommer: As my follow-up, I'd like to ask, do you have -- what's your expectation for the impact of vaccine mandate on your headcount and headcount growth? And sort of in that context is -- do you see anything unique in your business or business mix that would either lessen or make the impact more severe than others who play in the government space? \nHoracio Rozanski: The short form of the answer is we've thought about that and taking that into account to the best of our ability in reaffirming our guidance. So at the numbers level, I think sort of that's the numerical answer. \n If I sort of click down below that, we are intent on getting 100% of our workforce compliant with our policy, which is consistent with the mandate. That is our goal. This is what we are dedicated to doing. I keep talking about the quality of this team over 29,000 people now. And our job is to retain everybody. We've done it in a very Booz Allen way. I think you know us well enough. Much like we've done everything, this has been a subject of rich, internal conversation. I personally held a couple of town halls. The last one had several thousand people who attended where we talked about it and took questions and had a very open and frank discussion, which was challenging at times but important. All of our leaders have done that too in their respective business. Our group leaders, our infrastructure leaders have all held these types of -- and we're having a great internal conversation. Again, challenging at times, but with a goal of trying to get to 100%. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. \nSeth Seifman: Maybe just a quick clarification first, Lloyd. I apologize if I missed it. Did you guys state the Liberty sales contribution in the quarter? \nLloyd Howell: We didn't in our prepared remarks. If you look in the Q, it's about $88 million from Liberty for this quarter. \nSeth Seifman: Okay. Great. And then roughly how many employees did Tracepoint add? And would you guys be willing to give a target for where you want to be at headcount at year-end? \nLloyd Howell: For just Tracepoint or for... \nSeth Seifman: No, no, for the whole company, yes. \nLloyd Howell: Tracepoint, just under 100 added to the mix. Every year, we go into the year target mid-single-digit growth. We're on pace for that, as Horacio and I have said. So we hope to be over the [ 30 thou ] mark or around near by the end of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. \nLouie Dipalma: Horacio and Lloyd, several times over the past few quarters, you cited a large civil cyber program that was as a contributor to your revenue deceleration. Has it restarted to a full run rate for the December quarter? \nHoracio Rozanski: Louie, the short form of the answer is not yet. We are seeing some ramp, but we are not back to the full run rate. \nLouie Dipalma: Sounds good. And on a separate topic, it appears that Accenture Federal paid a very premium multiple for Novetta. Is Booz Allen willing to pay like very high multiples for strategic deals that bring a lot of technology content? Or just in terms of deal valuation, should investors more or less expect similar types of multiples to what you paid for Liberty? \nLloyd Howell: I'll start and then Horacio wants to get in. Before we even get to the economics, I mean, we look at every opportunity in terms of strategic alignment, cultural integration and then, financially, does it make sense? Within that rubric, we have the capacity to stretch if it makes sense, if the first 2 criteria are met. But as you've heard me say in the past, we're going to be disciplined and patient. And we feel we've got a great handle on this market, what clients need. And we're looking for partners to bring into Booz Allen that makes sense. But that's about where I think financially we spend. \nHoracio Rozanski: Yes, I think within the concept of strategic acceleration and the discussion that we've been having, we appreciate the need to pay full price for high-value, high-quality companies. And at the same time, we want to make sure that we're capturing significant value from those. So like Lloyd said, we're going to be disciplined, we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to leverage the same approach that we have to everything. We're going to build relationships. We're going to execute a disciplined playbook to the extent that we can, and we were successful twice this year. We're going to try to do it in a way that isn't an overheated auction. And again, we are leaning forward on this, but in a disciplined way. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. \nRonald Epstein: Yes. Maybe a couple of quick questions. One, are you seeing any indirect impact of the supply chain issues, the chip shortage? And just to understand and maybe you can give us all better feeling for it, because the big defense companies really haven't. Where is the supply chain issue for them, right? I mean this industry, at least the guys making hardware seem to be -- have been harder hit by supply chain and even the commercial side of the industry. \nLloyd Howell: Yes, Ronnie, we have not seen any of the dynamics that others have talked about regarding supply chain. To your point, we just don't have those issues. The other companies that whatever their portfolio looks like, it is what it is. But for us, we aren't seeing any supply chain issues. \nRonald Epstein: Got it. Got it. And then as we get into the second half of the year, it looks like your -- you've some pressure on your EBITDA margins. What's that coming from? \nLloyd Howell: Yes. It's really 4 areas. We're going to continue to ramp up in hiring. It's really 2 flavors of that, folks who have sold their funded positions as well as what we call capability hires in anticipation of work that's on the horizon. \n Number two is that typically in the back half is where we reward our people. \n Number three is we make improvements to our infrastructure and technology as we have an eye toward the next fiscal year. \n And we step up our investment in growth areas and capabilities that we think are going to position us for the future. \nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. I'll just close out by just saying we're intent on delivering against the conversation at Investor Day of 50% increase in adjusted EBITDA through 2025. That requires us to grow the top line, to drive strong margins and to invest intelligently to make it all work both for the short and for the long term. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further -- no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks. \nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Katherine. I'll just close by saying how great it was to have the opportunity to see so many of you in New York City earlier this month. Certainly, it was great in and out itself, but also being able to safely hold an in-person Investor Day was an encouraging indicator that we are indeed emerging from COVID. \n We look forward to keeping you updated in future calls regarding the progress on our VoLT strategy and especially on the superior financial performance, we believe, it will produce. \n We're extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for our firm, for our clients, for our people and certainly for our investors. \n So as always, thank you for your continued interest and support, and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good morning, everyone. \n Laura, it's great to have you play a more public role on these calls because you have been a leader on our finance team and integral to the quarterly earnings process for many years. I have personally relied on your expertise for as long as I've been CEO. So welcome to the call, Laura, and thank you for taking on this extra responsibility on an interim basis. \n And everyone, thanks for joining the call. Lloyd and I, along with several of our Booz Allen colleagues, were excited to be in New York City earlier this month to share our new investment thesis and our strategy for growth. It was great to see so many of you in person, and we hope you took away from that event a deeper understanding of our strategy, business and multiyear financial goals. \n Today, we will continue the conversation in the context of our second quarter results for the fiscal year. And we will show how Booz Allen is already setting up to accelerate into the financial goals described in our investment thesis. I'm also pleased to share an update on our future work rollout. \n Before diving into the second quarter results, I want to briefly recap a few points from our Investor Day, starting with VoLT: Velocity, Leadership and Technology. VoLT is the strategic framework that will accelerate our growth and create exceptional shareholder value. Through VoLT, we will capitalize on future market opportunities and leverage our positioning to deploy talent and capital against the nation's highest priorities. \n As part of our new strategy, we also told you about the opportunities we see for hyper growth in the areas of digital battle space and national cyber, among others. \n And then those of you who attended AUSA a week later saw some of our differentiated technology solutions that are transforming national missions. Specifically, demos of Rainmaker and a few of our edge solutions are excellent examples of how we are leading in our market. \n Fueled by the investments we have made during Vision 2020, Booz Allen holds first-mover advantage at key intersections of technology and mission. \n The overall strategy is important because it's what creates our strong financial performance year-to-year. And on Investor Day, we were pleased to present our new investment thesis. It's the multiyear outlook that will frame our quarter-to-quarter performance going forward. \n At the core of these theses is accelerating growth in adjusted EBITDA dollars through fiscal year 2025. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Broadly, we expect this increase to be driven by above-market organic revenue growth, continued strong margins and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. \n To be more specific, our path to 50% adjusted EBITDA growth includes financial expectations of 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment during the period. \n The leadership team and I are confident that we can accelerate growth and achieve the goals in our investment thesis. We have the right strategy. And more importantly, the right team is in place to drive our business. This quarter's results demonstrate that Booz Allen is already positioned for acceleration. \n So let me shift now to an overview of the second quarter. As we have said since fiscal year 2022 began, this year's growth pattern looks different from recent fiscal years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration expected in the second half. This pattern is primarily due to 3 factors: first and most important, a ramp-up in hiring; second, productivity and time of dynamics tied to the pandemic that create challenging comps in the first half; and third, full inclusion of revenue from acquisitions. These factors contribute to choppiness at the top line. And with our second quarter results now final, you can see that the first half of the fiscal year played out just as we expected. \n For the full 6 months, revenue growth was in the low single digits. We are pleased to report that across bottom line metrics, we outperformed in the first half, with strong profit margins driving EBITDA and ADEPS growth. Book-to-bill for the second quarter was strong, reflecting a significant year-over-year increase in bookings. And cash generation was exceptional. \n Our latest results demonstrate several key things about our business at the midpoint of the fiscal year. We are not demand-constrained, as shown in our backlog and book-to-bill performance. \n Hiring, which is our top operational priority, rapidly accelerated over the first 2 quarters. We continue to attract and retain the talent we need in a very competitive market and we aim to keep our momentum going. \n Our team is managing the business extraordinarily well, which can be seen especially in the bottom line metrics. We are well underway with making strategic acquisitions and successfully integrating them, with our acquisition of Tracepoint last month being the most recent example. \n I am excited to welcome the Tracepoint team to Booz Allen. We're already seeing a lift from combining Tracepoint's channel access and incident response expertise with Booz Allen's cyber consulting and managed services offerings. And while we did face headwinds from comps and a slow ramp-up on some contracts, we continue to manage through them. \n Taken together, our first half results and the strong operational performance behind them point to acceleration through the rest of the fiscal year. To achieve our second half objectives, we are focused on a set of priorities that are critical to our success. Let me walk through them. \n Our top priority remains recruiting. We must continue strong hiring to execute our growing backlog. Second, we will maintain operational excellence in managing the business. Third, we will continue to capture key market opportunities. Fourth, we will capitalize on the upside presented by our acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. And fifth, we will continue to invest in our people and differentiated solutions to drive growth beyond this fiscal year. \n Lloyd and I are confident Booz Allen will continue to make progress on these objectives. And today, we are pleased to reaffirm guidance for the full fiscal year. We believe that our growing momentum will both deliver another successful year and accelerate our business into the years covered by our new investment thesis. \n Lloyd will share more details on our results and fiscal year 2022 guidance in a few minutes. Before giving him the floor, I want to provide an update on the implementation of our future of work program. As you may recall, we believe we can offer our people increased flexibility in the way we work, with the expectation that many of our people will work in a hybrid model, a mix of telework and purposeful in-person collaboration. \n We have plans to launch future of work and reopen all our offices on September 7. But those plans have to be delayed. It just was not safe at the time, given the summer wave of COVID driven by the Delta variant. \n Since then, case metrics have improved and we are implementing a vaccination policy consistent with the federal governance mandate, requirements and time line. We're making excellent progress in our vaccination rates. And earlier this month, we began a phased reopening of offices that have remained closed, and we expect to have all offices open by November 22. \n We are excited to now be in the position to safely engage more broadly with clients and colleagues in person. Our people did an extraordinary job staying connected over the past 19 months. But just like Investor Day, there are times when being face-to-face is best. Our future of work program provides the flexibility to come together with purpose, when and where it makes the most sense. \n With the opportunity to see more of our teams, clients, investors and other Booz Allen stakeholders in person, I am feeling energized and confident about the future. And my optimism is enhanced by the strong performance we delivered in the first half and how it sets us up for acceleration for the rest of the fiscal year and well beyond. \n And with that, Lloyd, over to you to take us through the financials in depth. Sheila, I'll add a couple of thoughts to what Lloyd just talked about and in this school of thought around acceleration of momentum. As Lloyd pointed out, there's a number of reasons why the numbers almost get better by comparison as we go into the second half. But what we're sensing and that has us confidence and optimistic is real momentum in the business. I think you can see it in the book-to-bill. I'll tell you the pipeline is really strong. And it's not just strong in terms of the numbers, it's the type of work that we described in both as being the next wave of growth for Booz Allen. And it's aligned to these key mission technology intersections where we see hyper growth. And so we believe that the work that we can show you in the quarter, plus the work that is coming, all positions us well, not just for the balance of this year, but against these 5 to 8 revenue -- organic revenue and the investment thesis through 2025 and beyond. Gavin, if I can just expand a little bit and connect this conversation to our Investor Day discussion, I think what you're seeing, if you look at the trends over the last couple of years, is that the margin potential in this business continues to improve as a result of the work that we're doing, our differentiation in the market. And frankly, this is a time to brag about the team, just the operational performance keeps getting better and better even in light of some really challenging conditions all around us. \n And what I think is impressive about the last 18 months is we've managed to drive margins, while at the same time, we invested our people. If you remember, we set a high $100 million for pandemic response. We did a lot of employee welfare work, especially around mental health over the last year. And a number of other things that position us well to continue to be an employer of choice and be able to drive the talent into the business that we need to achieve our goals. \n So as Lloyd pointed out at Investor Day, what we have in front of us is real margin potential and the ability to invest in our business intelligently, as the opportunities present themselves, to continue to drive both top and bottom line growth. I mean everything we're hearing from clients, and I spent a lot of time with clients at AUSA, I spent time with clients really over the past 6 months, with a lot of plans across the board, not just in defense. But in particular, defense clients see the work that we're doing in digital battle space as absolutely a priority for great power competition and for what's to come. And so while it is true that things now are a little slower than they would like and we would like, we're doing great in terms of driving those businesses, and we expect momentum to accelerate. Maybe I'll start with this one just to switch up the pattern. As we talked about at Investor Day, our posture in M&A is to look for opportunities that are strategic accelerators to our business. And that is becoming a central plank of VoLT and in some ways a bit of a difference from our prior approach. And Tracepoint is a great example of that. Liberty is a great example of that. Albeit small, our investment in Latent AI a while back is a great example of strategic acceleration. And so that's the goal. \n Underneath that, it's a very competitive market. It's challenging to find the right things that will give us strategic acceleration. What we're seeing is some of the uniqueness of Booz Allen that makes us attractive to clients and to talent. Actually reflects also well as being attractive in the acquisition arena, where we're able to potentially have better discussions, more relationship-based discussions, and reach a mutually agreeable win-win-type scenario, even in the light of some overheated evaluations that are operating around us. Tobey, happy to do that. And I think I'm going to try and do justice to Betty Thompson's really excellent conversation about this at Investor Day. But I would put this in really 3 categories. And again, I mean, I think the numbers bear out what we're saying. The increase in headcount over the first half is the combination of we are not seeing this great resignation wave that people are talking about. In fact, our attrition rate is at or below what we had forecasted for the year and really strong hiring. And it's not just what we're -- as you know, we're bringing in technical talent, we're bringing the highly clear talent. We're bringing the kind of talent we need to execute against our strategy. \n And I would put the -- what we're doing and why it's working in 3 categories. The first one, which Betty really talked about at length is the combination of our culture, our focus on diversity and the work we've done over the last 1.5 years to keep our workforce safe and keep our workforce productive and engaged is clearly paying dividends in our value proposition and our brand in the talent market. \n The second one is where there's internal and external excitement about our future of work program. We can't wait to really get that rolling. As I said in my prepared remarks, we had to delay the rollout by about 1 month, 1.5 months to accommodate the realities of the Delta wave. And I am not one to try to predict the sort of the course of the pandemic going forward, but I'm optimistic and we're getting going, and hopefully we'll have all of our facilities open under the new future of work protocol right around Thanksgiving. \n And the third one, which I think is really important, especially as it relates to technical talent, is the type of work that we're both doing and we're investing in under VoLT is the work that is most exciting to type of talent we're trying to attract, right? The ability to bring AI to a core national mission gives us an opportunity to attract AI talent on par with any technology company out there. We may have deeper pockets, but don't have access to the passion that these missions represent for people. So if you look across all 3 of those, I think this explains why we had a good first half on hiring, but I think it also explains why we're optimistic about having momentum in the future. The short form of the answer is we've thought about that and taking that into account to the best of our ability in reaffirming our guidance. So at the numbers level, I think sort of that's the numerical answer. \n If I sort of click down below that, we are intent on getting 100% of our workforce compliant with our policy, which is consistent with the mandate. That is our goal. This is what we are dedicated to doing. I keep talking about the quality of this team over 29,000 people now. And our job is to retain everybody. We've done it in a very Booz Allen way. I think you know us well enough. Much like we've done everything, this has been a subject of rich, internal conversation. I personally held a couple of town halls. The last one had several thousand people who attended where we talked about it and took questions and had a very open and frank discussion, which was challenging at times but important. All of our leaders have done that too in their respective business. Our group leaders, our infrastructure leaders have all held these types of -- and we're having a great internal conversation. Again, challenging at times, but with a goal of trying to get to 100%. Louie, the short form of the answer is not yet. We are seeing some ramp, but we are not back to the full run rate. Yes, I think within the concept of strategic acceleration and the discussion that we've been having, we appreciate the need to pay full price for high-value, high-quality companies. And at the same time, we want to make sure that we're capturing significant value from those. So like Lloyd said, we're going to be disciplined, we're going to be thoughtful and we're going to leverage the same approach that we have to everything. We're going to build relationships. We're going to execute a disciplined playbook to the extent that we can, and we were successful twice this year. We're going to try to do it in a way that isn't an overheated auction. And again, we are leaning forward on this, but in a disciplined way. Yes. I'll just close out by just saying we're intent on delivering against the conversation at Investor Day of 50% increase in adjusted EBITDA through 2025. That requires us to grow the top line, to drive strong margins and to invest intelligently to make it all work both for the short and for the long term. Thank you, Katherine. I'll just close by saying how great it was to have the opportunity to see so many of you in New York City earlier this month. Certainly, it was great in and out itself, but also being able to safely hold an in-person Investor Day was an encouraging indicator that we are indeed emerging from COVID. \n We look forward to keeping you updated in future calls regarding the progress on our VoLT strategy and especially on the superior financial performance, we believe, it will produce. \n We're extremely excited about the opportunities ahead for our firm, for our clients, for our people and certainly for our investors. \n So as always, thank you for your continued interest and support, and have a great day."

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Announcement. As some of you know, our Head of Investor Relations, Rubun Day, recently left the company to pursue other opportunities. We thank him for his contributions and wish him well. \n Our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Laura Adams, has stepped in as Interim Head of Investor Relations, which she will oversee while also maintaining her ongoing role. Laura has been a finance executive with the firm for over a decade, overseeing many areas of corporate finance, including governance, financial and treasury oversight and risk mitigation. She has played a vital role for me and our leadership team in our strategic decision-making around our capital allocation and M&A plans and our investment thesis more recently. \n With that, I turn the call over to Laura. Thanks, Horacio, and hello again. Before I speak through our latest results, I want to add my thanks again to those who were able to join us just a few weeks ago in New York City for Investor Day. A recording of the webcast is available at investors.boozallen.com. \n Our overall objective with Investor Day was to once again demonstrate Booz Allen's commitment to long-term profitable growth. Leveraging our VoLT strategy, we will make the internal investments and strategic acquisitions required to drive and execute that growth. \n In our view, the first half of fiscal year 2022 was an inflection point. As we move into the second half of the fiscal year and move past the direct and indirect influences of COVID over the last 19 months, we are entering the next leg of the firm's multiyear journey. \n As Horacio noted, we closed out the first half of the fiscal year with top line performance in line with our expectations and prior guidance and with bottom line performance well ahead. This gives us great confidence in our plan for the full fiscal year. Our large backlog, strong bookings and proposal activity signals continued client interest and strong demand for our work. Our hiring engine is now firing on all cylinders, positioning us to drive growth in the second half of the fiscal year. We closed on the acquisitions of Liberty and Tracepoint. \n As we have noted, we anticipated early year choppiness in our top line results as we move into a post-COVID operating rhythm, which played out as we expected. Our strong balance sheet position and favorable market conditions have allowed us to take advantage of a number of opportunities, including attractive levels of debt financing, M&A and share repurchases. \n As a reminder, we had forecast constrained low single-digit top line growth in the first half, with an acceleration through the fiscal year, driven by 3 dynamics: a ramp-up in contracts and hiring; normalizing staff utilization and time-off usage, growing contributions from acquisitions. I will speak to these in more detail when I address our guidance. \n With that, let me walk you through the second quarter results. Please turn to Slide 5. \n At the top line, in the second quarter, revenue increased 4.3% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 3.6% to $1.5 billion. Revenue growth was driven by inorganic contributions and solid operational performance, offset from higher-than-normal staff utilization in the comparable prior year period. \n Now let me step through performance at the market level. In defense, revenue declined by 0.6%, primarily due to a significant material purchase in billable expenses and unusually high staff utilization in the prior year period, a headwind felt throughout most of our markets. Defense also saw some slowness in ramp-ups on both new and existing work, while ongoing protests continue to create uncertainty on the timing of program starts. In the first 6 months, revenue increased 1.8%. \n In civil, revenue grew by 16.4%, led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of Liberty. Liberty's contribution so far is slightly outpacing our previously forecasted range of $300 million to $340 million of annualized revenue. We remain exceptionally pleased with Liberty's performance and contribution to Booz Allen and are well underway with plans to fully integrate it with our broader health and digital business. We are feeling momentum across this entire market as we continue to capture key opportunities aligned to the government's priorities. In the first 6 months, revenue increased 11.2%. \n In intelligence, we recorded 0.8% revenue growth this quarter. Our portfolio-reshaping efforts have started to yield critical wins, and we are excited to see this business return to growth. For the full first 6 months, revenue declined 2.9%, but we believe this will continue to turn around in the second half of the fiscal year. \n Lastly, revenue in global commercial declined 5.7% compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to strategically shift focus to our U.S. commercial cyber business and anticipate growth in the back half of the fiscal year as we accelerate hiring to capitalize on the strong demand and additive growth in the business from Tracepoint. In the first 6 months, revenue declined 17.2%. \n Please turn to Slide 6. Our book-to-bill for the quarter was 2.03x, while our last 12 months' book-to-bill was 1.28x. Total backlog grew 18% year-over-year, resulting in backlog of $29 billion, a new record. Funded backlog grew 9.7% to $4.9 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 54.7% to $9.5 billion. And priced options grew 4.4% to $14.6 billion. We are proud of our bookings performance in the second quarter which continues to demonstrate we are not demand-constrained and our ability to win and convert on work aligned with our core capabilities and clients' most critical missions. \n Pivoting to headcount. As of September 30, we had approximately 29,200 employees, up by about 1,600 year-over-year, or 5.8%. In the first half of the fiscal year, we added approximately 1,500 employees. \n As we have previously noted, the competition for talent, particularly technical talent, remains fierce. Still, we have successfully executed our hiring and retention strategies. As Betty Thompson highlighted at Investor Day, those strategies focused on fostering a strong people-centered culture and effective talent systems that support individual pursuits as well as business needs. \n Accelerating headcount growth remains a top operational priority for this fiscal year and will be key as we move into the next multiyear period of our investment thesis. We expect to continue building on our progress through the second half of the fiscal year. \n Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $270 million, up 18.1% from the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 12.8% compared to 11.3% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by 3 factors: first, profitable contract level performance and mix which includes the inorganic contributions into our results; second, prudent cost management; and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $7 million negative impact on the prior year period under the CARES Act. \n As we move through the fiscal year, we expect billable expenses and unallowable spends to ramp up, with billable expenses, which are currently near the low end of our historical 29% to 31% range, expected to move towards the midpoint of that range by the fiscal year end. \n Second quarter net income increased 14% year-over-year to $155 million. Adjusted net income was $170 million, up 19% from the prior year period, primarily driven by the same factors driving higher adjusted EBITDA. Diluted earnings per share increased 16% to $1.14 from $0.98 the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% to $1.26 from $1.03. These increases to our non-GAAP metrics were primarily driven by better operating performance, the inclusion of Liberty, a lower effective tax rate and a lower share count due to our share repurchase program. \n Turning to cash. Cash from operations was $470 million in the second quarter compared to $426 million in the prior year period. This increase was driven primarily by continued strong cash management, fueled by consistent operational performance. \n Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior year period, driven by investments for future growth. We still expect capital expenditures to land within our forecast range for the fiscal year. \n Please turn to Slide 7. During the quarter, we paid out $50 million for our quarterly dividend and repurchased $106 million worth of shares at an average price of $83.31 per share. We also acquired the remaining stake in Tracepoint, a promising digital forensics and incident response business. As you may recall, we took a minority stake in Tracepoint last December and the partnership has proven so fruitful that we completed the purchase in September. In total, including the close of the Tracepoint acquisition, we deployed $285 million during the quarter. \n Today, we are announcing that our Board has approved a regular dividend of $0.37 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 15. As our actions and performance demonstrate we remain committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through a disciplined balance capital allocation posture. \n Turning now to guidance, please move to Slide 8. Before I address the numbers, I want to highlight our continued expectations for a distinct first half, second half dynamics this fiscal year. Let me walk through the puts and takes of this second half ramp, starting with the top line perspective. \n First, we expect year-over-year comparables and staff utilization to normalize in the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, in fiscal year 2021, staff utilization trended roughly 300 basis points above typical levels in the first half of the year before starting to normalize in the third quarter. \n Second, we expect that our ramp on both contracts and hiring will translate into growth as we move through the fiscal year. Strong customer interest and proactive demand signals give us confidence that any near-term slowness in the acquisition process is likely temporary, notwithstanding any unforeseen disruptions in government funding. On the other hand, from a supply perspective, our efforts to improve hiring, in some cases ahead of demand, have paid off. \n Third, our growing Liberty business will fully contribute in the second half of the fiscal year relative to a partial first half. \n Lastly, minor timing differences in our costing of labor, resulting from the implementation of our new financial management systems. \n Putting it all together, we still forecast significant acceleration from our first half performance ramping through the fourth quarter, barring any major disruptions such as a prolonged government shutdown or other dynamics outside of our control. \n Regarding adjusted EBITDA margins, we exercised considerable control over our cost structure and margin levers. We traditionally take a conservative approach to cost management early in the fiscal year and prioritize investments in our people, infrastructure and long-term growth objectives as we move throughout the fiscal year. Given the slowness we noted in the government's contracting process, we have maintained a tighter grip on our cost levers into this fiscal year. However, we still expect to make those same investments in the second half of the fiscal year, which will pressure back half adjusted EBITDA margins. \n Taking these factors into consideration, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth to be between 7% and 10%, inclusive of Liberty and Tracepoint. We expect adjusted EBITDA margin in the mid-10% range. Let me reiterate that we expect to make investments in our people and our technology in the second half of the fiscal year to support our multiyear growth aspirations. That said, given our strong first half results, we expect to finish near the top end of our current guidance. \n We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4.10 and $4.30 based on an effective tax rate of 22% to 24%, 134 million to 137 million weighted average shares outstanding and interest expense of $92 million to $95 million. \n We expect operating cash flow near the low end of our prior $800 million to $850 million range, which is inclusive of approximately $56 million of cash payments related to the Liberty transaction. \n And finally, we expect CapEx in the $80 million to $100 million range. \n Finally, I would like to round out the conversation by looking to the future and our new investment thesis, which Horacio recapped in his remarks. As we continue to position ourselves for a post-COVID operating environment, we believe that our actions and performance throughout the remainder of fiscal year '22 will put us on the right trajectory to accelerate our growth and execute on our investment thesis. We are truly excited for the future of this firm and all we can accomplish for both our clients and our investors. \n With that, Laura, let's open the lines for questions. So Sheila, let me start to unpack those questions. On the revenue front, we're pleased that the growth is in line with our expectations and positions us for acceleration in the second half. \n I think what's important is there are about 3 reasons that we're confident. One is that the ramp-up and improvement in our recruiting and hiring, as Horacio and I said in previous calls, this is the operational priority. And with a first half adding 1,500 folks this year, up just under 6% year-over-year, particularly in a very tight job market, we're very pleased with that part of our operations kicking in. We're not done. With an eye toward the balance of the year, we've got to maintain that pace. But as Betty shared with everyone at Investor Day, we're feeling really confident about that. \n The second point is that we're kind of in an apples and orange kind of comparison this year. The productivity and the time off dynamics last year, people weren't taking any time off. Our productivity was through the roof. And by our estimation, that's about a 400, 450 basis point headwind. So if you take the growth that we had this quarter and you were to add to that, we're in the mid-single digits which keeps us on pace for why we're confident in the second half of the year. \n And then the third point, I would add is that we're going to get the full inclusion of revenue from the acquisitions that we've made. Liberty is off to a great start. The integration is going very well. We've won some significant procurements together. And we just see that continuing. \n And then I'll finish sort of my part of the response, because you probably have to remind me of the other parts of your question, but when you look at our backlog, book-to-bill, 2.03x for this quarter trailing 12 months to 1.28x. As we've always said, we don't feel demand-constrained especially when the backlog is up 18% to an all-time record of $29 billion. \n So we've got the supply side underway. The demand signals are strong. We're working through, as you heard in our prepared comments, some timing issues in some parts of the portfolio. But overall, we believe we're on pace for an acceleration in the second half. Sheila, you had second part... \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: That's okay. I was on Tracepoint, how do we think about the total revenue contribution for Tracepoint, given it was a minority interest? And I think you guys spent $114 million in the quarter on that? Yes. At this point, it's really not that material. We're excited about the transaction with the simple fact that this is a high-demand area, particularly for our global commercial clients, but in this part of the journey, it's really not material. Yes. I mean, right out of the gate, we've had solid operational performance, and I think our margin performance is indicative of that. There are a couple of things I'd point to in terms of what's happening structurally. \n One is that as we're emerging from the pandemic, things that have going into it been very strong was profitable contract level performance, and that has maintained over the past 18 months. And I think that's been a tailwind to our margin. \n Number two is we're now seeing the contributions from our inorganic transactions, more fixed-price work, particularly when you're looking at what Liberty has brought to the game. \n And over the past several years, we've had a real prudent cost management set of initiatives underway. And I think across the portfolio, all of that has kicked in and is really institutionalized. \n For this period, we've also had some unique, what I call, contributions. One is now we have the ability to bill for fee in the Intel market. The timing of unallowable spend, which gets, I think, to your trend question, we expect to start to pick up in the back half of this year. \n And we've probably repeatedly talked about billable expenses and the fact that they've been low versus historical norms. And you heard in our prepared remarks that we're expecting that to kind of pick up move into the middle of the range. \n So on a trending perspective, we see it beginning, in terms of spending, to pick up in the back half of the year. We'll probably see that it will come back a bit due to some of our investment activity. But as you know, in the back half of Booz Allen, we usually are investing in our people, our infrastructure, getting ready for the next fiscal year. Yes. I mean it's as frustrating to us as, I think, to anyone. I think in our defense market, a couple of dynamics. One is we continue to be well positioned for long-term growth. And the demand for our services continues to accelerate a lot of our client urgency around modernization, as Karen spoke to during our Investor Day and the Joint Warfighter. \n We've got, again, a tough comp to Q2 of last year, where productivity is at all-time high. That being said, we've won really good work, but the ramp-up has been slower than expected. We're expecting in the second half of this year for that to pick up. There's no indications from our clients that they intend for that dynamic to persist. So we're working our way through it. And we've also got some larger opportunities that we're expecting to come in, in the back half of this year as well. Yes, Matt. It's really a function of Liberty coming into the portfolio. They've been doing great. Clients have been very pleased. We've also seen some upside potential there, which would sort of provide some tailwind to the margin. We've got strong contractual performance across the portfolio. So a combination of that plus Liberty is the dynamic. So Cai, let me pick up your first comment regarding PTO. We expect the impact, by our estimate, to be around 400 basis points to start to mitigate in the second half. So I would be supportive of what Northrop said or shared in terms of it over time starting to normalize. I think we're all watching it closely. Our workforce's PTO balances is elevated, obviously, because folks haven't been going on. We have a program in place to manage that and track it, but we would expect that, that will start to normalize going forward. \n In terms of organic growth, no purposeful oversight or reason why we didn't repeat it, but we still remain 4% to 7%, given that we've had a nice pickup in headcount, as I've always shared with you, that with inflation on top of it puts us comfortably in that range for the year. \n And we've also said that we expected the first half to be low single digits. And the organic component of that, I think it's tracking. And we expect that to accelerate in the second half. \n So again, some moving pieces here, but all consistent with what we expected, and we still remain confident about the guidance for the full year. That's correct, Cai. We didn't in our prepared remarks. If you look in the Q, it's about $88 million from Liberty for this quarter. For just Tracepoint or for... Tracepoint, just under 100 added to the mix. Every year, we go into the year target mid-single-digit growth. We're on pace for that, as Horacio and I have said. So we hope to be over the [ 30 thou ] mark or around near by the end of the year. I'll start and then Horacio wants to get in. Before we even get to the economics, I mean, we look at every opportunity in terms of strategic alignment, cultural integration and then, financially, does it make sense? Within that rubric, we have the capacity to stretch if it makes sense, if the first 2 criteria are met. But as you've heard me say in the past, we're going to be disciplined and patient. And we feel we've got a great handle on this market, what clients need. And we're looking for partners to bring into Booz Allen that makes sense. But that's about where I think financially we spend. Yes, Ronnie, we have not seen any of the dynamics that others have talked about regarding supply chain. To your point, we just don't have those issues. The other companies that whatever their portfolio looks like, it is what it is. But for us, we aren't seeing any supply chain issues. Yes. It's really 4 areas. We're going to continue to ramp up in hiring. It's really 2 flavors of that, folks who have sold their funded positions as well as what we call capability hires in anticipation of work that's on the horizon. \n Number two is that typically in the back half is where we reward our people. \n Number three is we make improvements to our infrastructure and technology as we have an eye toward the next fiscal year. \n And we step up our investment in growth areas and capabilities that we think are going to position us for the future."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rubun Dey.\nRubun Dey: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Announcement. We hope you have had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Ruben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. As always, Lloyd and I are pleased to share our latest financial results and to represent the great work of the more than 28,000 people of Booz Allen. In addition to discussing our first quarter performance, this morning, I will take a little time to talk about the future of work. Our industry, in fact, the entire economy is transitioning to more in-person work as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And at Booz Allen, we are excited about the opportunities this presents to our people and clients. After my remarks, I will give Lloyd the floor to cover the financials in more depth. Let me start with an overview of the quarter. On our last call in late May, we talked about our near and midterm priorities and our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We said we expect another year of significant revenue growth with strong earnings growth, continued cash generation and strategic deployment of capital.\nLloyd Howell: Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the financials, I want to note that this has been a truly busy quarter for us. A few of the major highlights included closing our acquisition of Liberty and launching the integration process, replenishing our balance sheet through the bond market. Investing in latent II, a highly strategic, rapidly growing company in the AI ML space. Doubling down on our recruiting and hiring efforts with promising results. Implementing our NextGen financial system. And, of course, engaging across the firm on our strategic review and our next investment thesis. We are energized by the pace of activity and look forward to sharing more in the months to come. Now on to first quarter performance. As we noted in May, we expected some early year choppiness in our top-line results as we move into a post-pandemic operating rhythm. However, we were able to maintain strong performance at the adjusted EBITDA and ADEPS line through disciplined cost management. Additionally, we are encouraged by our solid bookings performance as well as our pace of recruiting. Operating cash flow was light of our initial forecast, but we view most of the moving pieces as either one-time or transitory.\nRubun Dey: Thanks, Lloyd. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.  Our next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nCarter Copeland: Hey good morning gentlemen. Horacio, I noted you spent a lot of time, a lot of emphasis talking about the objective on hiring and getting headcount out through the course of the year. I mean I realize that it is always a dynamic situation out there in the job market. But are you encountering any sort of new challenges here? I realize it is a different working environment but as you try to hit those targets for headcount additions. What sort of challenges are you running into in this market?\nHoracio Rozanski: Carter, I think if you look at the numbers, things are looking very good. We have sequential month-over-month increases in hiring. And the team is very focused on this. As we have talked about before, this is a highly competitive market. And so the key for us is to continuously renew our employee value proposition and make sure that people know why Booz Allen is the right place to come to work. You might have seen it in the last couple of weeks, we were rated by Forbes as the number two company for diverse talent. Just this week, we were rated also by Forbes as the top company in the country for women and this is based on surveys of employees. And that just speaks to the fact that the people at Booz-Allen feel strongly about what we are doing, how we are doing it and are telling everybody. And so while we need to keep our foot on the gas, I am confident that we can ramp up recruiting to the right levels, and we will stay on it.\nLloyd Howell: Carter, I would just add that I think it was the last quarter, we said that this was going to create some choppiness, but the reality is we are seeing good momentum, 4.3% growth year-over-year and 3% quarter-to-quarter. We just have to stay at it. And I think the things that we have got underway are beginning to work.\nCarter Copeland: Okay. And Lloyd just a quick one on the cash flow and obviously the receivables dynamic in the quarter, how long in terms of that transition and client billing and whatnot, do you think that will take to kind of correct itself if you will?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean we are confident that the solid processes that we put in place are really going to kick in. And as it was pointed out in the prepared remarks, it was late really due to a one-time transaction-related expenses to Liberty. And we see that this year, it is going to turn around. We are expecting things to begin to improve next quarter and beyond.\nCarter Copeland: Awesome. Thank you gentlemen.\nLloyd Howell: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMatthew Akers: Hi good morning, thanks for the question. Horacio, you talked about kind of the three operating models and people sort of shifting to this more of a hybrid work model. I guess can you talk about what the financial impacts of that? Is there an opportunity for more profitability or there is any sort of cost savings there ultimately kind of flow back to your customer?\nHoracio Rozanski: You know it is - I would put this in the to learn category. There is a lot to learn on this path and to understand. I do believe having said that understand - I do believe having said that, that the increased flexibility will do a couple of things for us. First of all, it allows us to serve clients more effectively and more efficiently, hopefully, from around the country. There is some concentration of our business in the Washington metro area that is a very contested talent market and while we are doing well here. Boy, I mean our clients and we would benefit from being able to bring talent for more across the country. And we are doing that from our team in Charleston serving clients here, our team at the Liberty team has a significant delivery center in Florida, and that is also working really well also. So I think this flexibility is great for that. And I think it is also great for people and to both attract and retain people, which is ultimately the driver of our growth and the driver of everything else. So overtime, and in the long run, I think this will make us more effective, more efficient and more profitable, but the near-term goal is to make us more flexible.\nLloyd Howell: And I would just add from a financial perspective, cost savings was not the driver here. It really was what is best for our people as well as our clients. And as you can see, with the low CapEx spend, we feel that is a reflection of the fact that we are emerging from COVID facility spend has been light. It will pick up a little bit. But at the end of the year, we still expect to be within our $80 million to $100 million in CapEx.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. And I guess if I could do one more. One of your peers, the other day kind of mentioned they were seeing some contract delays may be driven by some protests. Is that something you guys are seeing at all or maybe you could just comment about sort of the contracting environment here as we come out of COVID.\nHoracio Rozanski: Right now, things are very robust. As you saw in our book-to-bill, we are back to a very robust book-to-bill backlog is record levels. And the pipeline looks very good. We are engaging with clients and they are very interested in both what we have to say and how we can help them, especially in these leading-edge areas where new technology meets mission to drive change.\nMatthew Akers: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Sharpe with Morgan from Mr. Sharpe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMatthew Sharpe: Good morning gentlemen and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch on Liberty IT here for a moment. Now that you guys have closed the deal and been able to get under the hood a bit, so to speak. Are there any changes to the $200 million revenue synergy target or any other assumptions around the deal and what, if anything new, have you learned now that you have been able to really get inside the business and take a look.\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me start by talking a little bit about what it feels like on the ground and then I think Lloyd can address any financials. I will tell you, we are really, really happy after close, we have really had an opportunity to get to know them better to start to work this together. We have a very detailed integration plan that we are following and it is working well. We are very comfortable, in fact, bullish about what we are going to do together in the market. They have a big growth curve, and they are on it. And we are beginning to see, frankly, a number of opportunities outside of where their core client relationships where like in defense, where what they do, especially around low code, no code is in high demand, and we can bring it as an integrated team. So all I would say is, again, early days, too soon to tell, but we really like what we are seeing. And I personally have really enjoyed getting to know this team and watch what they can do.\nLloyd Howell: On a financial dimension, I got to echo Horacio\u2019s comments we are also very comfortable and pleased with how it is playing out. There is no change to what we expected at the beginning in terms of the $200 million, and we are working very well together and integration is going well.\nMatthew Sharpe: Fantastic. And then just a quick one on your AI and ML business. At this point, you have got two of the largest DoD contracts out there and eMAPS in Jake. You have also made some investments in this space, e.g., the late AI deal earlier this quarter. Can you guys size that business the AI and ML overall business at Booz? And how should we think about growth expectations for this market going forward.\nHoracio Rozanski: I guess I will start again. I will say the following. We don\u2019t view AI as its own thing and following. We don\u2019t view AI as its own thing and neither do our clients. We view AI as a critical technology to drive mission. And so even in these contracts that have an AI-centric scope, the work is not just building algorithms, it is taking things from the lab to the field, which requires a large number of things. We are seeing AI penetrate areas from not just the ones we are talking about, but cyber, certain intelligence topics, we are going to see it in space. We believe this is a major wave, and we are, by all accounts, a leader in driving this. You saw us do the late in AI investment because we are excited about the technology they have around compression algorithms and the ability to bring AI to the edge more efficiently. And we intend to not just protect but really expand our leadership position.\nMatthew Sharpe: Fantastic. Thanks for the update gentlemen.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes thanks so much. Good results. So $67 million, basically in acquisition cost that seems extraordinarily high could you give us some color why was it so high? Was it in G&A because if it wasn\u2019t G&A and I take it out, it looks like the G&A percent of revenues was down $200 million. Could you share some light on all those issues?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Of the $67 million, about $56 million of it was due to a transaction bonus plus advisory fees and retention costs. So as we said in our prepared remarks, it is really the original purchase price that amount came out in terms of bonuses and retention.\nCai von Rumohr: But I mean if you back all that out of your G&A, it looks like the G&A is was the G&A is really the ongoing G&A rate around 11.6%, 11.7% versus 12.6% last year so that the G&A is actually fundamentally much lower or -.\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I would say at the beginning, Cai, it is a bit too early. From our perspective, it will be cyclical and will play out over the course of the year.\nCai von Rumohr: Okay, thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Yes hi, thanks very much and good morning everyone. A quick question, I apologize if you mentioned this, but I think last quarter, you guys talked about a pause on a large cyber program. And I was wondering if you could update us on that, if that is back to expected levels and you have the future revenue and earnings expectations for that program?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. We are still optimistic that, that program will receive the funding and sort of reinitiate. If you are following sort of the comings and goings of budget discussions, clearly, cybersecurity is a priority of this administration, and they have the virus a portion of the budget to that. It takes a bit of time for that money to sort of trickle down into the various agencies and departments. But in close conversations with our clients, they remain optimistic that they indeed will receive the necessary funding not the least of which is in today\u2019s environment, it is definitely needed. So we are positioned well. We have been in touch with our clients throughout the transition. And we are expecting at some point this year for things to resume.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, I guess, if I look back in time, maybe before fiscal 2020, you guys kept a lower level of cash on the balance sheet, and it got pretty high. And then we had the Liberty acquisition. I guess are you thinking from here that how much cash you want to kind of keep in reserve in order to have options for M&A versus share repurchases as we go through the rest of this year?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. I mean pre-pandemic, 2020 and even earlier, I\u2019ve always said we need about $150 million for working capital needs. And as you point out, we have been well north of that for some time. We see that as a strength. As Horacio and I have been sharing, we expect to leverage our balance sheet, not the least of which when it comes to capital deployment, will be inorganic opportunities and Liberty is the most recent example of that. But we have also got a pretty disciplined patient capital deployment approach. So whether it is repurchases or regular recurring dividend, we will make the call as the environment teams. But we have got a healthy, as you point out, balance today, about $1.6 billion in cash, and we are always looking to deploy that to the benefit of our shareholders in the near, mid and long-term.\nHoracio Rozanski: I will just put on one point that Lloyd made, which is that we increasingly view M&A as a strategic accelerator for our business. If you look at Liberty, if you look at Tracepoint, if you look at late in AI, they are allowing us to Leap pro our own development efforts by sometimes for years. And we are excited to do that. And to the extent that we can continue to find opportunities like that, we intend to take advantage of them.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: Lloyd, in response to Seth, you mentioned cyber budgets or funding Obviously, those are growing, but it seems like there have been some pretty big numbers proposed, whether it is part of COVID relief or the latest TMF request, but it feels like those numbers have come in a lot lower. Why is that, is there a will but not a way to fund.\nLloyd Howell: No we are not seeing that. I mean there is definitely a will as Horaciill sharef with you. He is talked to many of our elected officials, both sides of the aisle that see this as an area of importance. And I think if anything, just sort of the natural friction of making decisions, adjudicating the budget, and then the departments and services sort of receiving that with what we are seeing. We are not detecting in our conversations, any hesitation or lack of momentum or desire, particularly when you are looking every day in the press that a solar wins or another more recent intrusion, it is definitely top of mind. So as I said in the earlier response, we are sticking close to our clients. We are talking to them and engaging on are the possible and once the money begins to flow, what is the best use of that. But again, it is going to play out over our fiscal year and we are on-track to meet what we guided to.\nGavin Parsons: Got it. And then a quick clarification on the Liberty - sorry, on headcount growth, does that include the Liberty acquisition?\nHoracio Rozanski: It does.\nGavin Parsons: So maybe excluding that, it looks like closer to something like 1.5%. I think you said the target for the year was mid-single digits to get you into the 4% to 7% organic range. What do we need to see that pace accelerate at over the next couple of quarters, assuming there is some lag dynamic of headcount utilization or headcount growth rate translating into revenue growth?\nLloyd Howell: Yes. I mean, we believe we are beginning to see it take place already. If you go back to Q4, Horacio and I said coming out of our FY 2021 Q3 that this was going to be operational priority for us, and we saw some improvement begins in our fourth quarter of last year. That has continued into this year. And initial indications are it is going to continue to build through the summer, and that will tee us up well for the second half. So it is happening, but it is a very competitive labor market, as I think we all know. And our business leaders are on it, and we are really beginning to see the results of that.\nHoracio Rozanski: I will just build on that by saying this is our top priority for the year. We have been honest and explicit about that. And what we need to see is sequential month-over-month growth. Recruiting, it is about momentum, it is about building pipelines and executing on pipelines of candidates. And that is what we are seeing inside the business. So we remain confident and that is why we are reaffirming our guidance and saying this morning, we are on-track.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.\nJoseph DeNardi: Could you just talk a little bit about organic growth expectations for the year. Sorry if I missed that in guidance, but what you all are expecting?\nLloyd Howell: No worries. For the year, we said 4% to 7%. And much like my previous comment, Joe, really is going to hang on our ability to bring on the necessary talent. We exited last fiscal year at a run rate of about 2%. We feel we are off to a good momentum building start to this fiscal year. But if we do what we expect to do, will push us to the upper end of that organic range. But again, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. That is helpful. But I\u2019m wondering if you could just follow up on the maybe maintaining the cash balance where it is at elevated levels, like what changed a couple of years ago to lead you all to think that is the right strategy and then what is the advantage that it offers you all? Is it M&A that allows you to transact more quickly or is it on the buyback side? Like what is the advantage it provides you?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. I will take you back to when it wasn\u2019t as robust as it is now. You all were peppering me with questions, okay, you need to improve on receivables and collections, and that is exactly what we did. We got a lot more efficient with our collections a lot more efficient with balancing that with payables. So it naturally led to an increase in our cash. And then quite frankly, with our capital deployment we did not sort of focus on M&A activity at that time. And Horacio and I began to say, \"Hey, look, we are going to maintain our organic growth leadership position and look for ways to add inorganic opportunities to that.\" And so now with the more robust cash position, we are looking to do more deals. Liberty is the most recent. We have also talked about Tracepoint, the investment we made there. And our pipeline of opportunities is continuing to grow. And that is what we really see sort of what will be the use of the cash going forward.\nJoseph DeNardi: Great. that is helpful. Thank you.\nLloyd Howell: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question is from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. I was wondering if you have any learning now that the slowdown in kind of pause in hiring that occurred last year is getting ramped up again. Because organic growth has been the hallmark of the company, and that was a sort of a rare deceleration seemingly for something in the market or at your customers that prompted you to slow it down? Have you learned anything that might help you avoid that kind of circumstance in the future?\nHoracio Rozanski: Toby, I will start. I think if I take you back, we were operating the business at very, very high utilization rates. And that was driven by the fact that people - the country was shut down, people are not taking time off. And so the extra productivity, if you will, the extra available hours almost acted as new headcount. And so it didn\u2019t make sense to keep pedal to the metal on that and it didn\u2019t make sense to force our team to really drive down that path at the time where we were worried about people\u2019s emotional health, we were worried about running the business efficiently, delivering on contracts and so forth. And frankly, we had a view that change in productivity back to normal levels was going to happen this spring, not last fall. And that was the one thing we misread. And so with the benefit of hindsight and looking forward, maybe we would hedge our bets a little more on when would things turn in an uncertain environment and think about that a little more carefully. I go back and I say, \"Well, we are learning from that, and we certainly can always do better.\" I\u2019m very proud of the way the team performed over the last year. My confidence in this team is at an all-time high in terms of what they can do and what they will do. And hiring is now back up to really good levels, and we expect it to go even further, which is sorry if I sound like a broken record, which is why I really do feel we are now on-track and driving the business the way we want to.\nLloyd Howell: The only thing I would add is there was a great deal of learning on the welfare of our people that we have. We spent a lot of time, whether it is through our $100 million resilience program. But as the year played out with all the different social matters that we were confronting, it really allowed us to have a different dialogue with our workforce that frankly, we are seeing lower attrition than we might otherwise. So the investment in our workforce, I think, learning for us.\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me come back one more time and we have talked a lot this morning about people and the importance of people to our business and the importance of taking care of people in our business. And so that is why we are thinking about how do we take the workforce forward and that is why we are proposing this view that we need to build our workforce going forward in 3D. Meaning more distributed, more digital and indeed more diverse. And I think if we focus on that, all of the questions about how we build this great workforce for the future, how we blow past 30,000 people and beyond, that is going to be the foundation for that.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you for the answer. My follow-up has to do with the commercial business. Could you refresh us on what the reorientation of that is? And then what your expectations for sort of a growth and margin profile are once that is complete?\nHoracio Rozanski: Why don\u2019t I start. We made a decision to deemphasize some of our business in the Middle East over the last 12-months and emphasize our cyber business center of the North America by serving clients around the world. And I think that was a really good decision. I think we are seeing some of the financial implications of that work its way through the P&L and this quarter, maybe next. But we expect strong growth in the second half, and we expect a good year. We are happy about Tracepoint and what we are seeing in that investment there. And we are bullish about the opportunity of serving clients on cybersecurity, which, as you know, is a national priority.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: I want to thank everyone for your time and for your questions this morning. We have opened the year with a solid performance. And as I hope you can tell, we are moving forward with a lot of energy and with confidence, both about the state of the market and our plans for the future. And in terms of plans for the future, we look forward to sharing with you a new investment thesis and more about our strategic direction this fall. But in the meantime, enjoy the summer, be safe, and have a great day, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Ruben, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. As always, Lloyd and I are pleased to share our latest financial results and to represent the great work of the more than 28,000 people of Booz Allen. In addition to discussing our first quarter performance, this morning, I will take a little time to talk about the future of work. Our industry, in fact, the entire economy is transitioning to more in-person work as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. And at Booz Allen, we are excited about the opportunities this presents to our people and clients. After my remarks, I will give Lloyd the floor to cover the financials in more depth. Let me start with an overview of the quarter. On our last call in late May, we talked about our near and midterm priorities and our fiscal year 2022 outlook. We said we expect another year of significant revenue growth with strong earnings growth, continued cash generation and strategic deployment of capital. Carter, I think if you look at the numbers, things are looking very good. We have sequential month-over-month increases in hiring. And the team is very focused on this. As we have talked about before, this is a highly competitive market. And so the key for us is to continuously renew our employee value proposition and make sure that people know why Booz Allen is the right place to come to work. You might have seen it in the last couple of weeks, we were rated by Forbes as the number two company for diverse talent. Just this week, we were rated also by Forbes as the top company in the country for women and this is based on surveys of employees. And that just speaks to the fact that the people at Booz-Allen feel strongly about what we are doing, how we are doing it and are telling everybody. And so while we need to keep our foot on the gas, I am confident that we can ramp up recruiting to the right levels, and we will stay on it. You know it is - I would put this in the to learn category. There is a lot to learn on this path and to understand. I do believe having said that understand - I do believe having said that, that the increased flexibility will do a couple of things for us. First of all, it allows us to serve clients more effectively and more efficiently, hopefully, from around the country. There is some concentration of our business in the Washington metro area that is a very contested talent market and while we are doing well here. Boy, I mean our clients and we would benefit from being able to bring talent for more across the country. And we are doing that from our team in Charleston serving clients here, our team at the Liberty team has a significant delivery center in Florida, and that is also working really well also. So I think this flexibility is great for that. And I think it is also great for people and to both attract and retain people, which is ultimately the driver of our growth and the driver of everything else. So overtime, and in the long run, I think this will make us more effective, more efficient and more profitable, but the near-term goal is to make us more flexible. Right now, things are very robust. As you saw in our book-to-bill, we are back to a very robust book-to-bill backlog is record levels. And the pipeline looks very good. We are engaging with clients and they are very interested in both what we have to say and how we can help them, especially in these leading-edge areas where new technology meets mission to drive change. Let me start by talking a little bit about what it feels like on the ground and then I think Lloyd can address any financials. I will tell you, we are really, really happy after close, we have really had an opportunity to get to know them better to start to work this together. We have a very detailed integration plan that we are following and it is working well. We are very comfortable, in fact, bullish about what we are going to do together in the market. They have a big growth curve, and they are on it. And we are beginning to see, frankly, a number of opportunities outside of where their core client relationships where like in defense, where what they do, especially around low code, no code is in high demand, and we can bring it as an integrated team. So all I would say is, again, early days, too soon to tell, but we really like what we are seeing. And I personally have really enjoyed getting to know this team and watch what they can do. I guess I will start again. I will say the following. We don't view AI as its own thing and following. We don't view AI as its own thing and neither do our clients. We view AI as a critical technology to drive mission. And so even in these contracts that have an AI-centric scope, the work is not just building algorithms, it is taking things from the lab to the field, which requires a large number of things. We are seeing AI penetrate areas from not just the ones we are talking about, but cyber, certain intelligence topics, we are going to see it in space. We believe this is a major wave, and we are, by all accounts, a leader in driving this. You saw us do the late in AI investment because we are excited about the technology they have around compression algorithms and the ability to bring AI to the edge more efficiently.

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into the financials, I want to note that this has been a truly busy quarter for us. A few of the major highlights included closing our acquisition of Liberty and launching the integration process, replenishing our balance sheet through the bond market. Investing in latent II, a highly strategic, rapidly growing company in the AI ML space. Doubling down on our recruiting and hiring efforts with promising results. Implementing our NextGen financial system. And, of course, engaging across the firm on our strategic review and our next investment thesis. We are energized by the pace of activity and look forward to sharing more in the months to come. Now on to first quarter performance. As we noted in May, we expected some early year choppiness in our top-line results as we move into a post-pandemic operating rhythm. However, we were able to maintain strong performance at the adjusted EBITDA and ADEPS line through disciplined cost management. Additionally, we are encouraged by our solid bookings performance as well as our pace of recruiting. Operating cash flow was light of our initial forecast, but we view most of the moving pieces as either one-time or transitory. Carter, I would just add that I think it was the last quarter, we said that this was going to create some choppiness, but the reality is we are seeing good momentum, 4.3% growth year-over-year and 3% quarter-to-quarter. We just have to stay at it. And I think the things that we have got underway are beginning to work. Yes. I mean we are confident that the solid processes that we put in place are really going to kick in. And as it was pointed out in the prepared remarks, it was late really due to a one-time transaction-related expenses to Liberty. And we see that this year, it is going to turn around. We are expecting things to begin to improve next quarter and beyond. Thank you. And I would just add from a financial perspective, cost savings was not the driver here. It really was what is best for our people as well as our clients. And as you can see, with the low CapEx spend, we feel that is a reflection of the fact that we are emerging from COVID facility spend has been light. It will pick up a little bit. But at the end of the year, we still expect to be within our $80 million to $100 million in CapEx. On a financial dimension, I got to echo Horacio's comments we are also very comfortable and pleased with how it is playing out. There is no change to what we expected at the beginning in terms of the $200 million, and we are working very well together and integration is going well. Sure. Of the $67 million, about $56 million of it was due to a transaction bonus plus advisory fees and retention costs. So as we said in our prepared remarks, it is really the original purchase price that amount came out in terms of bonuses and retention. Yes. I would say at the beginning, Cai, it is a bit too early. From our perspective, it will be cyclical and will play out over the course of the year. Sure. Sure. I mean pre-pandemic, 2020 and even earlier, I've always said we need about $150 million for working capital needs. And as you point out, we have been well north of that for some time. We see that as a strength. As Horacio and I have been sharing, we expect to leverage our balance sheet, not the least of which when it comes to capital deployment, will be inorganic opportunities and Liberty is the most recent example of that. But we have also got a pretty disciplined patient capital deployment approach. So whether it is repurchases or regular recurring dividend, we will make the call as the environment teams. But we have got a healthy, as you point out, balance today, about $1.6 billion in cash, and we are always looking to deploy that to the benefit of our shareholders in the near, mid and long-term. No we are not seeing that. I mean there is definitely a will as Horaciill sharef with you. He is talked to many of our elected officials, both sides of the aisle that see this as an area of importance. And I think if anything, just sort of the natural friction of making decisions, adjudicating the budget, and then the departments and services sort of receiving that with what we are seeing. We are not detecting in our conversations, any hesitation or lack of momentum or desire, particularly when you are looking every day in the press that a solar wins or another more recent intrusion, it is definitely top of mind. So as I said in the earlier response, we are sticking close to our clients. We are talking to them and engaging on are the possible and once the money begins to flow, what is the best use of that.

So it is happening, but it is a very competitive labor market, as I think we all know. And our business leaders are on it, and we are really beginning to see the results of that. No worries. For the year, we said 4% to 7%. And much like my previous comment, Joe, really is going to hang on our ability to bring on the necessary talent. We exited last fiscal year at a run rate of about 2%. We feel we are off to a good momentum building start to this fiscal year. But if we do what we expect to do, will push us to the upper end of that organic range. But again, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator. Sure. I will take you back to when it wasn't as robust as it is now. You all were peppering me with questions, okay, you need to improve on receivables and collections, and that is exactly what we did. We got a lot more efficient with our collections a lot more efficient with balancing that with payables. So it naturally led to an increase in our cash.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on slide two. With me today to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown on the disclaimer on slide three, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking, and may relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our SEC filings and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 earnings release and slides. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on slide four.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Matt and I are pleased to share excellent financial results for fiscal year 2023. Every day the people of Booz Allen bring their best to our client's most critical missions. Their hard work and dedication continue to produce outstanding outcomes. Over the past year, we have strengthened our momentum and continued to deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth. Today, Matt and I will discuss the full year results and our fiscal year 2024 guidance in the context of our investment thesis. I will also share an update on the leadership dimension of our VoLT growth strategy and describe our priorities for the year ahead. Let's begin with fiscal year 2023, another outstanding year for Booz Allen. Our performance puts us on track to deliver on our investment thesis which we first discussed with analysts in October of 2021. Our investment thesis targets growing adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We expect to accomplish this goal through the following levers, industry-leading organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% annually, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s. We continued investment for future growth and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes small-to-mid-size strategic acquisitions. At this point, organic growth and profit are above our forecasted ranges and inorganic contribution is somewhat behind base. When put together, we are on track with excellent momentum and optionality as we move into our second year in the planning horizon. Diving deeper into the full FY'23 results, it is clear our leaders are doing an excellent job on hiring, selling, and the cost management priorities we outlined last May. Total revenue grew 10.7% fueled by a record selling 10.6% client staff headcount growth. Our total backlog grew 6.7% to $31.2 billion bolstered by wins that insert leading-edge technology into priority mission areas. We are growing efficiently in a challenging inflationary environment and delivered $1.014 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with an 11% adjusted EBITDA margin. We also completed the acquisition of EverWatch last October and began integrating it into our portfolio. This morning, I also want to update you on our settlement discussions with the Department of Justice or DOJ over its civil investigation into highly technical elements of our cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the US government over the period from 2011 to 2021. As a reminder, on May 12th, 2021, the DOJ notified us that it had closed its criminal investigation with no further action. Regarding the civil matter, we are limited in what we can say as we are in active settlement discussions with the DOJ. We reserved an additional $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. We also disclosed that the range of reasonably possible loss in connection with the investigation is between $350 million and $378 million, inclusive of the amount recorded in our financial statements. Since we have always believed that we acted lawfully and responsibly, we would not admit any wrongdoing. Booz Allen cooperated with the DOJ inquiry since first learning about it nearly six years ago. If we do settle, we would avoid the delay, uncertainty, and expense of protracted litigation into an immensely complex cost accounting matter. Now let me shift to VoLT. Our strategy to accelerate growth by rapidly bringing innovation to national priority missions. Having described the V and the T in prior earnings calls, today I will discuss the L or leadership dimension of VoLT. In this context, leadership is about being first to build scale positions that solve challenges at the mission and technology intersection. It's leading by correctly anticipating the decisive moment that fundamentally transform missions and create extraordinary growth opportunities. Today our nation is at a historic inflection point. Instability in the geopolitical environment and the rapidly accelerating pace of technological change are converging. This creates complex interconnected mission challenges. Two top priorities are the pacing threat of China and the rise of artificial intelligence or AI. As our country faces these realities, Booz Allen is prepared to leave in our industry and beyond. Let me begin with China. For over two decades, we have been expanding our presence in the Indo-Pacific region in support of Defense and Intelligence missions. Today, our team in Hawaii has grown to over 300 professionals and our cutting-edge Honolulu office includes an Innovation Lab where we co-create solutions with clients. We have an additional 200 employees positioned across the entire INDOPACOM region. As our clients' priorities and resources increasingly shifted the Pacific, we are already established in the geography and prepared to support our clients growing efforts. Given the strategic importance of the mission to counter China, earlier this year, our entire Booz Allen leadership team was on the ground in Hawaii. We engage with senior defense clients and community leaders to discuss the full range of opportunity and need. I came away with a renewed sense of urgency to invest and position our best technology capabilities in the region. I see an opportunity to lead by rapidly providing our clients with scaled solutions that integrate multi-domain technology and critical infrastructure protection across all of our work. This connects to our leadership position on the second priority, artificial intelligence or AI, where we have been investing for years in anticipation of the historic disruption we are now seeing. We are the largest single provider of AI services to the federal government and we were recently recognized by Frost & Sullivan as a growth and innovation leader in AI. Booz Allen has four primary differentiators that enable us to take Trusted AI Solutions from the lab to the mission at scale. First of all, our world class talent. Our team of experienced AI, ML, and data practitioners is scaling to meet demand, growing by over 20% in fiscal year 2023. We're also training experts in adjacent disciplines to ensure AI is infused into all of our work. Second, our large and growing portfolio of contracts. This includes two of the largest AI contracts in the history of DoD, and beyond our AI center portfolio, many of our largest mission contracts have AI in scope. For example, we are pleased to announce that we recently won the $919 million EDITS task order. Through this work, Booz Allen will insert new technologies to help enhance the capabilities available to the Warfighter in all environments in combat situations. Third, our innovation engine. Our proprietary AI software factory known as AI-Assemble offers reliable reusable solutions that can be quickly tailored for the mission. And more broadly, Booz Allen has been piloting and experimenting with generative AI for years, well ahead of it jumping into popular cautiousness. And finally, our robust ecosystem of innovation partners provides access to the latest developments across the entire tech stack. AI has been a primary focus of our corporate venture fund and we're pleased with the progress we are seeing. Our position as a leader is one of both insight and responsibility. That is why we have been working for years on an ethical AI framework that quantifies risks and supports measurable responsible AI models. Our recent investment in Credo AI augments our capability. Our nation is facing unprecedented threats and challenges. In this environment, we are proud to deliver AI innovation across all the missions we support. And we see significant opportunities ahead, especially as we look to integrate artificial intelligence with other key technology areas, such as our extensive cyber and digital transformation capabilities. Let's shift now to fiscal year 2024. I want to provide the strategic context for the detailed guidance Matt will outline later in this call. We have ongoing momentum entering fiscal year 2024. Our headcount growth, strong demand, and funding for client priorities enable acceleration into the first half of the fiscal year. Conversely, we are planning for challenging external dynamics in the second half of the year. The ongoing debt ceiling and budget negotiations create uncertainty for our clients and we recognize that a timely budget for the next government fiscal year is likely out of reach. This lack of clarity and volatility around funding can often delay decision-making and contract awards. Therefore, our fiscal year 2024 guidance reflects both our incoming momentum and a range of funding scenarios for the next budget cycle. When taken together, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion, supported by strong revenue growth between 7% and 11%. This guidance sustains our commitment to deliver on our FY'25 investment thesis goals, and Matt will cover both our results and guidance in much more depth. Before handing off to Matt, I'd like to describe four priorities for the year ahead. These support achieving our multi-year financial objectives and align to those factors we can control. First, we must focus on aggressively capturing and starting work before September 30th. This is particularly important in our Intelligence accounts where we are seeing higher-than-anticipated contract turnover. Second, we must continue to run our business tightly, evolving our operating model to support fast growth and create capacity for continued investments. Third, we will continue implementing VoLT, looking for opportunities to accelerate our growth in new or evolving priority areas such as space and climate. And fourth, we remain committed to deploying capital in a way that maximizes shareholder value. Our focus remains small to mid-sized acquisitions as a strategic accelerator to our VoLT objectives. In closing, as we begin fiscal year 2024, I am very proud of everything our people accomplished in this past year. Booz Allen is nearing 32,000 professionals who bring their all in support of our clients and our institution, it is through their passion and talent that we continue to deliver industry-leading organic growth, and have strong momentum strategically and operationally. The challenges facing our nation are immense and Booz Allen's purpose and values inspire and drive us to innovate and find solutions. This gives me optimism about the future. I am confident in what we can do to help lead the way to a better tomorrow. And now Matt over to you to take us through the full financial results.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I too am very pleased with our operating and financial results. We had a strong fourth quarter, closing out an excellent fiscal year 2023 at both the top and the bottom lines. The momentum we built on both the supply side and the demand side, positions us well for the future as you will see in our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Booz Allen continues to produce industry-leading organic growth. Our margins are underpinned by the quality of our offerings and the strength of our execution. We are augmenting and accelerating our organic performance with a patient and disciplined capital deployment approach, and as a result, we remain on track to deliver on our multi-year investment thesis. I have a lot to cover today, so I will start by hitting the highlights of our fourth quarter performance then turn to our fiscal year 2023 results and finally close with our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were in-line with our expectations as we finished the fiscal year strong while investing in the talent and the capabilities to drive future growth. In the fourth quarter, we delivered overall revenue growth of 8.7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth of 7.7%. This performance was driven by continued headcount growth, a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.47 times, and client staff utilization that declined in the fourth quarter but is in line with our current growth posture. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew to $231 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This was a function of our overall growth, strong contract-level performance, and continued efforts to operate more efficiently. This translated to us generating $1.01 in ADEPS for the quarter, a growth of 17% year-over-year. In the quarter, we returned $191 million of capital to investors, primarily through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we added over 800 net client staff in the quarter, a Q4 record due to strong hiring and seasonally low attrition. Now please turn to slide six, as I discuss our full fiscal year 2023 results. Total revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 10.7% year-over-year to approximately $9.3 billion exceeding the top end of our guidance. Organic revenue growth was 9% year-over-year. And revenue excluding billable expenses grew 9.5% to approximately $6.5 billion. Our growth in fiscal year 2023 was broad-based. In Defense, revenue grew approximately 7% year-over-year. We are expanding our work at the core of national defense priorities, leveraging emerging technologies such as those Horacio described to transform missions and provide our Warfighters with decision advantage. Hiring remains a focus for our defense leaders, as their success to date has allowed us to ramp up new work and convert backlog. This business continues to accelerate. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 19% year-over-year. This growth was particularly strong in our health and citizen services accounts and across our cyber and digital services offerings. We continue to see growth in our civil markets with a healthy proposal pipeline and the talent needed to convert on existing backlog. In Intelligence, revenue grew by approximately 7% year-over-year. This business delivered flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter due to tough year-over-year comps in billable expenses and cost recovery on certain contracts. We expect modest growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, but this will taper during the year as our Intelligence business has seen higher-than-anticipated contract turnover. Our intel market leaders are focused on realizing the full value of the EverWatch transaction and repositioning our work against critical defense intelligence, national intelligence and cyber emissions. And finally, our global commercial revenue increased approximately 6% year-over-year. Our work providing critical cyber and incident response services to commercial clients and its connection to our government cyber mission remains a small but strategically important part of our overall portfolio. On the labor supply side, we ended the fiscal year with approximately 29,000 client staff, an increase of 10.6% year-over-year. Total headcount, inclusive of corporate staff, increased only 8.9% reflecting our ongoing focus on managing the business more efficiently. We continue to see both hiring momentum and significantly lower attrition rates compared to prior years. On the demand side, our strong backlog of work and a robust proposal pipeline provides good near-term visibility. We ended fiscal year 2023 with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 times. Our total backlog was $31.2 billion, up approximately 6.7% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 24.5% to $4.6 billion, unfunded backlog fell 4.1% to $9.5 billion and priced options grew 9.3% to $17.1 billion. Looking forward, our qualified pipeline of $46 billion is up approximately 14% compared to this time last year. With the current year budget in place, we are leaning into this pipeline to win as much work as possible and to get it on contract in advance of the coming budget negotiations. At the bottom line, we earned $1.014 billion in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023, finishing at the high end of our guidance range. This is a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was in line with our expectations and our guided range. Our net income decreased 41.9% year-over-year to $271 million. This was primarily a result of the $350 million legal reserve we recorded in connection with the ongoing DoJ matter in fiscal year 2023. Adjusted net income, which excludes this reserve, was up approximately 6.5% year-over-year to $605 million. Diluted earnings per share decreased 41% year-over-year to $2.03, primarily as a result of the aforementioned legal reserve. Excluding this reserve, adjusted diluted earnings per share or ADEPS increased 8.3% year-over-year to $4.56. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended fiscal year 2023 with a cash balance of $405 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver. Free cash flow for the year was $527 million. This was the result of $603 million of cash generated from operating activities net of $76 million of CapEx. Our operating cash flow reflects our strong operating performance, offset by higher cash taxes due to the impact of Section 174, higher interest and higher spending on growth-oriented investments in our people and our business. Our net debt at the end of the fiscal year was approximately $2.4 billion and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.4 times adjusted EBITDA. Turning to slide eight. In fiscal year 2023, we deployed approximately $905 million of capital in a measured and balanced manner. This included approximately $440 million connected with the EverWatch acquisition, $236 million in cash dividends and $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $91.83 per share. We remain patient and disciplined in our capital deployment approach as we navigate macroeconomic conditions, budget uncertainty and a challenging M&A environment. However, we remain focused on finding small to midsized tuck-in acquisitions that are consistent with our culture and VoLT strategy, active accelerants to growth and meet our financial parameters. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share that will be payable on June 30th to stockholders of record as of June 15th. Please turn now to slide nine for a discussion of our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As Horacio noted, we are entering into a period of uncertainty in our external environment. This is a familiar pattern for us. In recent years, we have typically guided to and planned for a strong first half and a more uncertain second half of our fiscal year. We are doing the same this year, as you will see reflected in our guidance and operating priorities. That said, we have significant momentum in our business, on the demand side, on the supply side and in our operations and we are well positioned relative to long-term demand trends. This supports fiscal year 2024 growth and profit guidance above the organic targets and our current investment thesis. At the top line, we are guiding to revenue growth of 7% to 11%, 6% to 10% of which will be organic. We expect to start the year at or above the top end of this range. Where we fall within this range for the fiscal year will depend on several factors, including the pace at which we can win work and get it on contract, the outcome of government funding and budgetary debates and the timing and extent to which we add consulting headcount throughout the year. At this point, we are targeting 3% to 5% growth for the full year, in line with historic patterns, but likely weighted towards the first half. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 10% to 11% range. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA dollar range of between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion or approximately 6% to 9% growth year-over-year. We expect ADEPS of between $4.80 per share and $4.95 per share or growth of approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of between $500 million and $600 million and free cash flow of between $400 million and $500 million. This assumes a CapEx spend of approximately $100 million and this cash guidance reflects EBITDA growth offset by continued investments to grow our business, higher interest costs and temporarily higher cash taxes. In closing, I want to recognize our Booz Allen team for their hard work, dedication to mission and commitment to the firm. It is through their efforts that we had an excellent finish to our fiscal year 2023, built momentum that supports continued outperformance in fiscal year 2024 are well positioned against the most pressing needs of our clients and remain on track to achieve our multiyear investment thesis. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning, and thanks for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Bert.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning, Bert.\nBert Subin: Good morning. So Horacio, hiring has been really strong and your results are reflecting that. You have a couple of contract headwinds that you alluded to as we think through FY'24. How are you contemplating the potential risk of just trying to reallocate that labor? And if the tighter budget backdrop does ultimately materialize, is the plan just to slow down hiring so that supply matches demand?\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you for that question. I'll start. To answer your specific question, I think you're asking the Focus Fox question. To give you some background there. Our contract now that the proposal that the protest has been adjudicated, we can talk a little more about this. Our contract will end on September 30th. Roughly speaking, we have about 400 Booz Allen people on the contract. We expect to retain about half, about 200 and reallocate them to other mission priorities. We have a lot of important cyber work going on throughout the firm that these folks would be tremendous for. So that's sort of the play on that. In the greater scheme though, when you look at the business overall, the business is doing great. I'm incredibly proud of where we ended last year with industry-leading organic revenue growth with a lot of momentum, as you pointed out. There's momentum on both sides. I think on hiring and retaining, there's great momentum, but there's also a number of contract wins and around things ramping up that make us feel like certainly over the next six months, the business is poised to perform very well. We are cognizant, as everybody else is that the second half is going to be challenging from a budgetary standpoint. And so our guidance for FY'24 reflects that range, if you will, the lower end of the range speaks more to a more challenging environment. The upper end of the range speaks more to a second half that looks more like a first half. But even if I get past that, and I look at the investment thesis horizon and everything else, we're on track. VoLT is paying the dividends we wanted it to pay and it positions us well for the long-term against topics like China, like AI, like 5G, cyber, quantum, I could keep going. So the business is in very good shape.\nBert Subin: Horacio, maybe on the one of the latter points you had there. Booz has been talking about AI for the last few years. And you gave a good update on your progress there. Now that there's been, I guess, more material inflection in AI-related demand just in the last few months, can you just walk us through what you've been seeing in your business and, I guess, more recently? And how meaningful of a revenue driver you're planning for AI to be in your fiscal '24 guidance?\nHoracio Rozanski: AI, as you pointed out, this is a topic that has been near and dear to my heart given my own background and something that we, as a firm, have been very focused on. We have a leading position that's backstopped by a talent base that is very large and growing at around 20% per year. A contract base that has not just some really big AI contracts, but we're infusing AI into all of our major procurements to the extent that it makes sense, and it increasingly makes sense, more and more clients are interested in either having the option to imbue AI or asking for it directly. And so this becomes a differentiator not just against our AI portfolio, but against our whole business. We have some unique IC and IP in this area that we're very proud of. I talked about AI-Assemble. There's a number of other things that we are doing. And the partnerships that we've built and we continue to build also give us an edge in the market. We have talked for years about the co-creation that we do with NVIDIA around in Cyber Precog. I spoke about that a couple of calls ago. We talk about the things we're doing with our corporate venture fund, finding small companies that have unique technologies, I really do believe that it's not just that we're a leader today in the federal space, but that we are poised to project that leadership more broadly over time.\nBert Subin: Thank you, Horacio.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Horacio and Matt and thank you so much. I wanted to expand upon the AI comment Horacio because I know you guys do so much there and you just talked about it a little bit. Within the next five years, how do you envision the DoD or your several customers implementing AI?\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me first say that my crystal ball is the same as everybody else is. I do believe that this is going to be a huge area of focus for all of our clients. If you break it down, first of all, the digital transformations that we're seeing that really affect our entire client base, especially our civil client base are going to require more and more use of AI to accelerate everything from coding to verifying to then managing these very large systems and very large, if you want, citizen interactions, there's just so much that AI can do to both lower cost and improve the way in which citizens interact with the federal government at the civil level, and that is huge. On the other side, on the national security side, I also believe that AI is going to increase the efficiency and reduce the decision cycle that our clients need to go through. And tying it to our other priority, this is very important as it relates to China, which, of course, is also investing heavily in AI and the US, which still has a lead, has to continue to maintain this lead. Our clients understand that, congressional leaders that I've spoken to understand that. Everyone is trying to figure out how to do this in a way that is both aggressive and sensible from the standpoint of being ethical and being very thoughtful about it. And again, we have both the brand, but most importantly, the capabilities and the people to be central to that conversation.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you. Sorry for putting you on the spot with that. And then maybe Matt, one for you.\nHoracio Rozanski: No, no. I appreciate it. This is a great question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Matt, for you, when we think about the cash guidance, operating cash flow guidance and about 70% free cash flow conversion versus 87% in '23, what sort is keeping you guys from getting to that 100% outside of Section 174?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah, good question.  we said we're targeting free cash flow yield of approximately 10% excluding 174. In '23, we delivered 110%, which was great, and we are going to be below that in '24 for a couple of reasons that we think are temporal. We are seeing an increase in working capital consistent with the rapidly growing business, particularly on the outlay side. Second and we talked about this last year, but there's some timing related issues related to some tax strategies we've been discussing. This year, we're going to have an incremental $50 million in cash taxes, but likely with no corresponding offset related to those tax strategies. But I will point you to an approximately $150 million receivable on our balance sheet that we do anticipate receiving in future years. And then obviously, we, like everyone else, are experiencing higher interest expenses. So I do expect, Sheila, to be in a meaningfully better position in FY'25 as some of this is temporal.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Rob. Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Horacio, I wanted to ask and perhaps this is for Matt as well. But as we think about all of the budget discussions and the potential for growth to be at the lower end of some of the predictive ranges of late, just based on what we're seeing come across in real-time on the fiscal '24 budget and what that might mean for holding growth. Beyond that, is there a concern perhaps that some industry players may try to compete a bit more aggressively on price in that kind of environment and that contract that margins just generally could come under pressure for the industry?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's an interesting debate. And we've seen this before right in the 2011-2012 timeframe. If we end up in a sort of more moderated budget environment in the next couple of years. And we've --- again we've -- from the standpoint of our '24 guide, we have taken some of the historical turbulence into account as we think about the second half of our business. On your specific question, there's always price pressure in this industry. This is not new. As you know, we have migrated our business to the extent possible to things that are at the center of our clients' missions that require much more technical content, that require a much more specialized IP and IC that make use of these partnerships and create more differentiation. We are always competing on price. Everybody else is, but I think we are in a somewhat less price sensitive part of the market because of the uniqueness of what we do. And at the same time, as I pointed out, Matt has pointed out in prior calls, we're also growing our business faster than we're growing our infrastructure in our back office in order to create flexibility in our operating model to be able to manage through the cycle. So if I step back and I say, okay, we have an investment thesis of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of EBITDA by FY'25, we're on track to deliver that taking into account, again, a reasonable market projection.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just as a follow-up to that, maybe in a similar vein, if defense is more protected in these budgets than some of the nondefense work, might you see the growth, both in revenues and EBITDA play out a little bit differently than in your internal plan, meaning that Civil perhaps becomes a bit of a bill payer across the government for defense and so you grow the one business more than you might have expected at the expense of the other?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start and I think Matt has probably a lot to say on this topic too. I'll point you to a couple of things. First of all, we have an operating model that allows us to shift resources quickly from one side to another, from one -- when we manage the business, we manage as an entity as opposed to a separate sectors on purpose so that we can really go toward the opportunities and shift leadership, resources and investment quickly as that makes sense. And I think that gives us some robustness regardless of the shape of the budget going forward. And then the other just minor point that I will make is if you think about our civil portfolio, we do have a significant amount of work, for example, with the VA and organizations that are likely to travel more with the defense portfolio than they will with sort of the more traditional civil accounts. So it is hard to tell how all of that will play out, that's why we like to stay at the macro level and talk about the overall firm.\nRobert Spingarn: Understood.\nMatt Calderone: And reading between the lines, I think you're trying to get at, do we expect to see margin pressure? And clearly, in our guidance this year, the answer to that is no. We're guiding to -- from high 10s to the 11% range. And embedded in that, we've anticipated the defense business is going to accelerate. And I just want to double-click on what Horacio said. We're operating the business very efficiently. And I feel like we've got our hands on a lot of the levers with respect to labor economics but also some of our corporate costs. And that just gives us a lot of optionality.\nRobert Spingarn: Makes sense. Thank you, both.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Spencer Breitzke with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.\nCai von Rumohr: Hi. I think you're talking about Cai von Rumohr. So you just recently announced  and you announced an IRS win were those wins actually made in the third -- in the fourth quarter and announced now? And then secondly, can you give us a little more color on Focus Fox why you lost? Because that's an area in which you've been particularly strong and the winter has not been as strong. Thanks so much.\nMatt Calderone: Yes, Horacio, do you want to take Focus Fox first?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. Cai, on Focus Fox, I think you would have to ask the client more than us. But in general, we have a very strong cyber business that is growing fast across the entire portfolio. This is one contract. And albeit a business that we wanted for a long time. It's a business that was migrating, the new contract is very different from the old one in terms of looking for lower skill sets. And therefore, it did not fully align with the type of work that we do and we like to do in the community. So I guess that's the best explanation that I can give. More broadly, though, we're seeing a lot of opportunity to deploy cyber resources across the portfolio, our defense clients with cyberspace is now really an active warfighting domain are more and more interested in making sure that they can get at scale some unique capabilities. And our civilian clients from a defensive posture are also very interested in that from a law enforcement perspective, from a critical infrastructure protection perspective. So as I look at, one of the things that we did, which we talked about in 2021, and I know you'll remember, is we built this national cyber platform where we allowed ourselves the opportunity to look horizontally across the entire cyber playing field as opposed to being stovepipe to minimize the national risk that exists in the seams of those stovepipe and that strategy has proven to be very successful.\nMatt Calderone: And Cai to specifically answer to your question about EDOS and EDITS they were included in our Q4 book-to-bill.\nCai von Rumohr: They were. Okay. And then last one. If, in fact, you see deceleration in Intel, isn't that a margin plus a mix plus?\nMatt Calderone: On the margins, but we're seeing acceleration in defense. And so the two will probably wash out.\nCai von Rumohr: Excellent. Thank you so much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Akers: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Horacio, I think you mentioned in the opening remarks that the M&A portion of your long-term strategy has been a little bit slower than it was like. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there in terms of what assets are available? And I guess if that continues, would you consider sort of other uses for the cash, maybe return more to shareholders?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'm going to let Matt start on this one since he's got all the background.\nMatt Calderone: Thanks. I think we're seeing an environment that is pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, which is a lot of -- it's a small to midsized opportunities, but both buyers and sellers that are being judicious in how they approach the M&A environment. So we're actively engaged in a lot of processes. We've gone reasonably far down the path in a couple of these. But I think we said or I said measured and balanced in the script just to sort of break it up from seeing patient discipline, but we're going to remain patient and disciplined. We've got industry-leading organic growth. We've got a strong balance sheet. If you look at how we deployed capital in '23 or even in Q4 of '23, it was very balanced and we're committed to deploying capital in a measured way to drive long-term shareholder value.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. Thanks. And then if you could touch on, I guess, the margins. So you're running a little bit of the sort of mid-10s long-term guidance that you've given, could you give, so what are the biggest drivers there? Is it mix or billable expenses? And is there opportunity to maybe come in ahead of that longer term if you can continue the strength?\nMatt Calderone: Yes. Well, I think we've come in ahead of that the last couple of years, and we're guiding ahead of the mid-10s this year. And so clearly that's a reflection not just to the quality of the work we're selling and our contract execution, but how we're managing our cost base.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. I want to just to amplify on that last point. When we built our investment thesis, we were thinking mid-10s because we also wanted to make sure we had the capacity to invest in the business in the right way. And the good news here is the acceleration of organic growth beyond what we originally predicted, opens that up a little bit. And then to Matt's last point, the fact that we're running the business so efficiently and so tightly also creates room in our rates to invest in the business and position us for growth. So that is giving us the opportunity to maintain margins above what we thought while also accelerating the investments required so that the business does well not just in '24 and '25, but really beyond.\nMatthew Akers: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: Matt, a follow-up on the cash flow question. Could you just bridge us from the $603 million operating cash flow in '23 for the $500 million to $600 million, I guess, between EBITDA, exactly what you're expecting for net working capital, R&D, broader cash taxes? Just help us with that bridge.\nMatt Calderone: Yes, I'm not going to give you much more than I want to have to-date. We'll look at getting out some more detailed guidance in the appropriate forums. But essentially, the bridge is threefold, right? Higher interest, higher taxes with no corresponding offset this year, but we anticipate something in FY'25 or beyond and higher outlays consistent with the working capital required to fund a growing business where 30% of your work is done through subs.\nDavid Strauss: Okay. And then a question about '25 investment thesis target. So you did a little over $1 billion in EBITDA in '23, forecasting close to $1.1 billion in '24. Is $1.3 billion possible? And as we think about 2025 or is it much more likely closer to the bottom end? And if $1.3 billion is possible, how do you get there?\nHoracio Rozanski: We're still on track to the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The business is doing extremely well. We're operating organically of our expectations. And as Matt pointed out, we are still very interested in strategic acceleration through M&A, if we can find the right assets at the right price. When you put all of that together, depending on timing and everything else, where we fall in the range that will be the guidance question a year from now. But right now, we are, again, we recognize that the budgetary situation is challenging that this creates uncertainty. We all read the papers this morning. There's still no deal on the debt ceiling. I think all of that is real, and we're not ignoring it, but we believe that as a business, we are well positioned to have a very strong first half to manage a reasonable set of outcomes in the second half, to deliver another year of organic revenue growth that leads the industry. And that hopefully positions us really well to have a strong '25 as well. So when you put it all together, we're working on what we can control. And if I can just do a shout out to the team, our team is doing an exceptional job of doing just that.\nDavid Strauss: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: I wanted to follow up on the Intelligence segment. And moving aside from just the Focus Fox contract, I think we've talked about that. But just as a percentage of sales, the intelligence portions, I think, down probably about five percentage points versus a few years ago. And kind of how you see that evolving in the mix? And is there something changing about that end market that kind of makes the opportunity there sort of less aligned with where you want to take the company?\nHoracio Rozanski: The Intel business is a very important part of our portfolio. We are very proud of the work that we do there. It fits within our overall national security approach. And there's a very close integration between what we do in defense and what we do in Intel. And increasingly, between what we do in some areas of Intel on the cyber side and the work that we do on some of the civilian agencies around critical infrastructure protection and the like the percentages and everything else are really driven by where we see opportunity at any point in time. In the last few years, our Civil business has done extraordinarily well and it's become a bigger share of our business and that's a business that continues to do very well and we're very proud of it. As we look into this year, I think we think our Intel business will probably level out, be more sort of towards the modest growth, maybe even flat as are -- there's been some contract turnover that we've been talking about. But I think what's really important to also talk about, which is not going to be in the numbers, is that there's a unique talent base in there that through our national cyber platform is being leveraged across the institution and creating growth in both defense and civilian clients and creating a lot of sustainability across the business. I think that's a big part of why Booz Allen is successful through different cycles is that we actually have in our operating model and the way we work together the ability to shift resources, I believe, much faster than anyone else. And I think that's a capability that is going to continue to serve us well, given the environment that we're in right now.\nMatt Calderone: And if you think about the leading-edge capabilities that Horacio has talked about, a lot of them have been really built and incubated into our Intel business. So in terms of the role it plays in our portfolio, historically, it has not grown as quickly as other portions of our portfolio, largely because of supply constraints in a highly clear environment. But the capabilities that the Intel business develops and we export across the remainder of our business in addition to the people Horacio described really are fundamental.\nSeth Seifman: Excellent. That's helpful. Thanks very much. And then just as a follow-up, I wonder if you guys could talk a little more specifically about this kind of second half budget environment that you're thinking about, just to kind of put a fine point on it? Because there's one set of outcomes that maybe people had been thinking about that was sort of involving government shutdowns, continuing resolutions, kind of really challenging kind of scarier stuff. And then there's another kind of path that's been talked about in some very recent reporting that's kind of, okay, maybe there's very low single-digit growth in the defense budget over the next few years, which maybe is not an ideal outcome, but given the other possibilities, not that bad either. So when you talk about a slowing second half and kind of not seeing the momentum continue in the second half, was that based on the idea of like full year continuing resolution government shutdowns type of scenario or an environment where we do get low single-digit growth is a good outcome or is that kind of consistent with kind of a real slowdown in the second half?\nHoracio Rozanski: If you look at our guidance, 7% to 11%. The top end of the range assumes that the second half looks a lot like the first half, a little bit more like what happened this last year where there was a full budget passed in December and that actually created certainty for our clients, and that was very helpful. Towards the end -- the lower end, it would be more uncertainty faced by our clients. I want to point out to you in a business like ours, the specific numbers, we don't have almost any programs that are dependent on line item in the budget. So this is really around how our clients see their opportunity to get things done and how either enable or impaired that it's going to be, and it's more of a perception from their perspective around what's happening than a specific number. So the sooner there is certainty about what's going to happen almost regardless of what that certainty is the more our clients can prioritize, I think we're well positioned. We're not going to be immune to cuts if there are cuts, but we're well positioned to be more resilient against that because we're at the center of the mission, doing unique and very important work. And that's -- so it really is how soon do we get to certainty. But overall, again, I'll leave you with a thought that we are guiding to a very strong set of numbers for FY'24, very strong organic revenue growth and really on track with what we said was our investment thesis goal for FY'25. So we're happy with where we are.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back over to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. As always, Matt and I are very proud of what the firm has accomplished and we're optimistic about the future. We have 32,000 people almost at Booz Allen now and they're working as hard as ever to serve our clients and to really change the world. And it's because of them really because of them that Booz Allen continues to thrive. So we look forward to another year of growth and success in fiscal year 2024 and to sharing information with you over time. Thank you again for joining and have a great day and a Happy Memorial Day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Matt and I are pleased to share excellent financial results for fiscal year 2023. Every day the people of Booz Allen bring their best to our client's most critical missions. Their hard work and dedication continue to produce outstanding outcomes. Over the past year, we have strengthened our momentum and continued to deliver industry-leading organic revenue growth. Today, Matt and I will discuss the full year results and our fiscal year 2024 guidance in the context of our investment thesis. I will also share an update on the leadership dimension of our VoLT growth strategy and describe our priorities for the year ahead. Let's begin with fiscal year 2023, another outstanding year for Booz Allen. Our performance puts us on track to deliver on our investment thesis which we first discussed with analysts in October of 2021. Our investment thesis targets growing adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We expect to accomplish this goal through the following levers, industry-leading organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% annually, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s. We continued investment for future growth and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes small-to-mid-size strategic acquisitions. At this point, organic growth and profit are above our forecasted ranges and inorganic contribution is somewhat behind base. When put together, we are on track with excellent momentum and optionality as we move into our second year in the planning horizon. Diving deeper into the full FY'23 results, it is clear our leaders are doing an excellent job on hiring, selling, and the cost management priorities we outlined last May. Total revenue grew 10.7% fueled by a record selling 10.6% client staff headcount growth. Our total backlog grew 6.7% to $31.2 billion bolstered by wins that insert leading-edge technology into priority mission areas. We are growing efficiently in a challenging inflationary environment and delivered $1.014 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with an 11% adjusted EBITDA margin. We also completed the acquisition of EverWatch last October and began integrating it into our portfolio. This morning, I also want to update you on our settlement discussions with the Department of Justice or DOJ over its civil investigation into highly technical elements of our cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices with the US government over the period from 2011 to 2021. As a reminder, on May 12th, 2021, the DOJ notified us that it had closed its criminal investigation with no further action. Regarding the civil matter, we are limited in what we can say as we are in active settlement discussions with the DOJ. We reserved an additional $226 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. We also disclosed that the range of reasonably possible loss in connection with the investigation is between $350 million and $378 million, inclusive of the amount recorded in our financial statements. Since we have always believed that we acted lawfully and responsibly, we would not admit any wrongdoing. Booz Allen cooperated with the DOJ inquiry since first learning about it nearly six years ago. If we do settle, we would avoid the delay, uncertainty, and expense of protracted litigation into an immensely complex cost accounting matter. Now let me shift to VoLT. Our strategy to accelerate growth by rapidly bringing innovation to national priority missions. Having described the V and the T in prior earnings calls, today I will discuss the L or leadership dimension of VoLT. In this context, leadership is about being first to build scale positions that solve challenges at the mission and technology intersection. It's leading by correctly anticipating the decisive moment that fundamentally transform missions and create extraordinary growth opportunities. Today our nation is at a historic inflection point. Instability in the geopolitical environment and the rapidly accelerating pace of technological change are converging. This creates complex interconnected mission challenges. Two top priorities are the pacing threat of China and the rise of artificial intelligence or AI. As our country faces these realities, Booz Allen is prepared to leave in our industry and beyond. Let me begin with China. For over two decades, we have been expanding our presence in the Indo-Pacific region in support of Defense and Intelligence missions. Today, our team in Hawaii has grown to over 300 professionals and our cutting-edge Honolulu office includes an Innovation Lab where we co-create solutions with clients. We have an additional 200 employees positioned across the entire INDOPACOM region. As our clients' priorities and resources increasingly shifted the Pacific, we are already established in the geography and prepared to support our clients growing efforts. Given the strategic importance of the mission to counter China, earlier this year, our entire Booz Allen leadership team was on the ground in Hawaii. We engage with senior defense clients and community leaders to discuss the full range of opportunity and need. I came away with a renewed sense of urgency to invest and position our best technology capabilities in the region. I see an opportunity to lead by rapidly providing our clients with scaled solutions that integrate multi-domain technology and critical infrastructure protection across all of our work. This connects to our leadership position on the second priority, artificial intelligence or AI, where we have been investing for years in anticipation of the historic disruption we are now seeing. We are the largest single provider of AI services to the federal government and we were recently recognized by Frost & Sullivan as a growth and innovation leader in AI. Booz Allen has four primary differentiators that enable us to take Trusted AI Solutions from the lab to the mission at scale. First of all, our world class talent. Our team of experienced AI, ML, and data practitioners is scaling to meet demand, growing by over 20% in fiscal year 2023. We're also training experts in adjacent disciplines to ensure AI is infused into all of our work. Second, our large and growing portfolio of contracts. This includes two of the largest AI contracts in the history of DoD, and beyond our AI center portfolio, many of our largest mission contracts have AI in scope. For example, we are pleased to announce that we recently won the $919 million EDITS task order. Through this work, Booz Allen will insert new technologies to help enhance the capabilities available to the Warfighter in all environments in combat situations. Third, our innovation engine. Our proprietary AI software factory known as AI-Assemble offers reliable reusable solutions that can be quickly tailored for the mission. And more broadly, Booz Allen has been piloting and experimenting with generative AI for years, well ahead of it jumping into popular cautiousness. And finally, our robust ecosystem of innovation partners provides access to the latest developments across the entire tech stack. AI has been a primary focus of our corporate venture fund and we're pleased with the progress we are seeing. Our position as a leader is one of both insight and responsibility. That is why we have been working for years on an ethical AI framework that quantifies risks and supports measurable responsible AI models. Our recent investment in Credo AI augments our capability. Our nation is facing unprecedented threats and challenges. In this environment, we are proud to deliver AI innovation across all the missions we support. And we see significant opportunities ahead, especially as we look to integrate artificial intelligence with other key technology areas, such as our extensive cyber and digital transformation capabilities. Let's shift now to fiscal year 2024. I want to provide the strategic context for the detailed guidance Matt will outline later in this call. We have ongoing momentum entering fiscal year 2024. Our headcount growth, strong demand, and funding for client priorities enable acceleration into the first half of the fiscal year. Conversely, we are planning for challenging external dynamics in the second half of the year. The ongoing debt ceiling and budget negotiations create uncertainty for our clients and we recognize that a timely budget for the next government fiscal year is likely out of reach. This lack of clarity and volatility around funding can often delay decision-making and contract awards. Therefore, our fiscal year 2024 guidance reflects both our incoming momentum and a range of funding scenarios for the next budget cycle. When taken together, we expect adjusted EBITDA between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion, supported by strong revenue growth between 7% and 11%. This guidance sustains our commitment to deliver on our FY'25 investment thesis goals, and Matt will cover both our results and guidance in much more depth. Before handing off to Matt, I'd like to describe four priorities for the year ahead. These support achieving our multi-year financial objectives and align to those factors we can control. First, we must focus on aggressively capturing and starting work before September 30th. This is particularly important in our Intelligence accounts where we are seeing higher-than-anticipated contract turnover. Second, we must continue to run our business tightly, evolving our operating model to support fast growth and create capacity for continued investments. Third, we will continue implementing VoLT, looking for opportunities to accelerate our growth in new or evolving priority areas such as space and climate. And fourth, we remain committed to deploying capital in a way that maximizes shareholder value. Our focus remains small to mid-sized acquisitions as a strategic accelerator to our VoLT objectives. In closing, as we begin fiscal year 2024, I am very proud of everything our people accomplished in this past year. Booz Allen is nearing 32,000 professionals who bring their all in support of our clients and our institution, it is through their passion and talent that we continue to deliver industry-leading organic growth, and have strong momentum strategically and operationally. The challenges facing our nation are immense and Booz Allen's purpose and values inspire and drive us to innovate and find solutions. This gives me optimism about the future. I am confident in what we can do to help lead the way to a better tomorrow. And now Matt over to you to take us through the full financial results. Good morning, Bert. Thank you for that question. I'll start. To answer your specific question, I think you're asking the Focus Fox question. To give you some background there. Our contract now that the proposal that the protest has been adjudicated, we can talk a little more about this. Our contract will end on September 30th. Roughly speaking, we have about 400 Booz Allen people on the contract. We expect to retain about half, about 200 and reallocate them to other mission priorities. We have a lot of important cyber work going on throughout the firm that these folks would be tremendous for. So that's sort of the play on that. In the greater scheme though, when you look at the business overall, the business is doing great. I'm incredibly proud of where we ended last year with industry-leading organic revenue growth with a lot of momentum, as you pointed out. There's momentum on both sides. I think on hiring and retaining, there's great momentum, but there's also a number of contract wins and around things ramping up that make us feel like certainly over the next six months, the business is poised to perform very well. We are cognizant, as everybody else is that the second half is going to be challenging from a budgetary standpoint. And so our guidance for FY'24 reflects that range, if you will, the lower end of the range speaks more to a more challenging environment. The upper end of the range speaks more to a second half that looks more like a first half. But even if I get past that, and I look at the investment thesis horizon and everything else, we're on track. VoLT is paying the dividends we wanted it to pay and it positions us well for the long-term against topics like China, like AI, like 5G, cyber, quantum, I could keep going. So the business is in very good shape. AI, as you pointed out, this is a topic that has been near and dear to my heart given my own background and something that we, as a firm, have been very focused on. We have a leading position that's backstopped by a talent base that is very large and growing at around 20% per year. A contract base that has not just some really big AI contracts, but we're infusing AI into all of our major procurements to the extent that it makes sense, and it increasingly makes sense, more and more clients are interested in either having the option to imbue AI or asking for it directly. And so this becomes a differentiator not just against our AI portfolio, but against our whole business. We have some unique IC and IP in this area that we're very proud of. I talked about AI-Assemble. There's a number of other things that we are doing. And the partnerships that we've built and we continue to build also give us an edge in the market. We have talked for years about the co-creation that we do with NVIDIA around in Cyber Precog. I spoke about that a couple of calls ago. We talk about the things we're doing with our corporate venture fund, finding small companies that have unique technologies, I really do believe that it's not just that we're a leader today in the federal space, but that we are poised to project that leadership more broadly over time. Thank you. Let me first say that my crystal ball is the same as everybody else is. I do believe that this is going to be a huge area of focus for all of our clients. If you break it down, first of all, the digital transformations that we're seeing that really affect our entire client base, especially our civil client base are going to require more and more use of AI to accelerate everything from coding to verifying to then managing these very large systems and very large, if you want, citizen interactions, there's just so much that AI can do to both lower cost and improve the way in which citizens interact with the federal government at the civil level, and that is huge. On the other side, on the national security side, I also believe that AI is going to increase the efficiency and reduce the decision cycle that our clients need to go through. And tying it to our other priority, this is very important as it relates to China, which, of course, is also investing heavily in AI and the US, which still has a lead, has to continue to maintain this lead. Our clients understand that, congressional leaders that I've spoken to understand that. Everyone is trying to figure out how to do this in a way that is both aggressive and sensible from the standpoint of being ethical and being very thoughtful about it. And again, we have both the brand, but most importantly, the capabilities and the people to be central to that conversation. No, no. I appreciate it. This is a great question. Thank you. Hey, Rob. Good morning. It's an interesting debate. And we've seen this before right in the 2011-2012 timeframe. If we end up in a sort of more moderated budget environment in the next couple of years. And we've --- again we've -- from the standpoint of our '24 guide, we have taken some of the historical turbulence into account as we think about the second half of our business. On your specific question, there's always price pressure in this industry. This is not new. As you know, we have migrated our business to the extent possible to things that are at the center of our clients' missions that require much more technical content, that require a much more specialized IP and IC that make use of these partnerships and create more differentiation. We are always competing on price. Everybody else is, but I think we are in a somewhat less price sensitive part of the market because of the uniqueness of what we do. And at the same time, as I pointed out, Matt has pointed out in prior calls, we're also growing our business faster than we're growing our infrastructure in our back office in order to create flexibility in our operating model to be able to manage through the cycle. So if I step back and I say, okay, we have an investment thesis of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of EBITDA by FY'25, we're on track to deliver that taking into account, again, a reasonable market projection. I'll start and I think Matt has probably a lot to say on this topic too. I'll point you to a couple of things. First of all, we have an operating model that allows us to shift resources quickly from one side to another, from one -- when we manage the business, we manage as an entity as opposed to a separate sectors on purpose so that we can really go toward the opportunities and shift leadership, resources and investment quickly as that makes sense. And I think that gives us some robustness regardless of the shape of the budget going forward. And then the other just minor point that I will make is if you think about our civil portfolio, we do have a significant amount of work, for example, with the VA and organizations that are likely to travel more with the defense portfolio than they will with sort of the more traditional civil accounts. So it is hard to tell how all of that will play out, that's why we like to stay at the macro level and talk about the overall firm. Thank you. Yes. Cai, on Focus Fox, I think you would have to ask the client more than us. But in general, we have a very strong cyber business that is growing fast across the entire portfolio. This is one contract. And albeit a business that we wanted for a long time. It's a business that was migrating, the new contract is very different from the old one in terms of looking for lower skill sets. And therefore, it did not fully align with the type of work that we do and we like to do in the community. So I guess that's the best explanation that I can give. More broadly, though, we're seeing a lot of opportunity to deploy cyber resources across the portfolio, our defense clients with cyberspace is now really an active warfighting domain are more and more interested in making sure that they can get at scale some unique capabilities. And our civilian clients from a defensive posture are also very interested in that from a law enforcement perspective, from a critical infrastructure protection perspective. So as I look at, one of the things that we did, which we talked about in 2021, and I know you'll remember, is we built this national cyber platform where we allowed ourselves the opportunity to look horizontally across the entire cyber playing field as opposed to being stovepipe to minimize the national risk that exists in the seams of those stovepipe and that strategy has proven to be very successful. Thank you. I'm going to let Matt start on this one since he's got all the background. Yes. I want to just to amplify on that last point. When we built our investment thesis, we were thinking mid-10s because we also wanted to make sure we had the capacity to invest in the business in the right way. And the good news here is the acceleration of organic growth beyond what we originally predicted, opens that up a little bit. And then to Matt's last point, the fact that we're running the business so efficiently and so tightly also creates room in our rates to invest in the business and position us for growth. So that is giving us the opportunity to maintain margins above what we thought while also accelerating the investments required so that the business does well not just in '24 and '25, but really beyond. We're still on track to the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. The business is doing extremely well. We're operating organically of our expectations. And as Matt pointed out, we are still very interested in strategic acceleration through M&A, if we can find the right assets at the right price. When you put all of that together, depending on timing and everything else, where we fall in the range that will be the guidance question a year from now. But right now, we are, again, we recognize that the budgetary situation is challenging that this creates uncertainty. We all read the papers this morning. There's still no deal on the debt ceiling. I think all of that is real, and we're not ignoring it, but we believe that as a business, we are well positioned to have a very strong first half to manage a reasonable set of outcomes in the second half, to deliver another year of organic revenue growth that leads the industry. And that hopefully positions us really well to have a strong '25 as well. So when you put it all together, we're working on what we can control. And if I can just do a shout out to the team, our team is doing an exceptional job of doing just that. Good morning. The Intel business is a very important part of our portfolio. We are very proud of the work that we do there. It fits within our overall national security approach. And there's a very close integration between what we do in defense and what we do in Intel. And increasingly, between what we do in some areas of Intel on the cyber side and the work that we do on some of the civilian agencies around critical infrastructure protection and the like the percentages and everything else are really driven by where we see opportunity at any point in time.

As we look into this year, I think we think our Intel business will probably level out, be more sort of towards the modest growth, maybe even flat as are -- there's been some contract turnover that we've been talking about. But I think what's really important to also talk about, which is not going to be in the numbers, is that there's a unique talent base in there that through our national cyber platform is being leveraged across the institution and creating growth in both defense and civilian clients and creating a lot of sustainability across the business. I think that's a big part of why Booz Allen is successful through different cycles is that we actually have in our operating model and the way we work together the ability to shift resources, I believe, much faster than anyone else. And I think that's a capability that is going to continue to serve us well, given the environment that we're in right now. If you look at our guidance, 7% to 11%. The top end of the range assumes that the second half looks a lot like the first half, a little bit more like what happened this last year where there was a full budget passed in December and that actually created certainty for our clients, and that was very helpful. Towards the end -- the lower end, it would be more uncertainty faced by our clients. I want to point out to you in a business like ours, the specific numbers, we don't have almost any programs that are dependent on line item in the budget. So this is really around how our clients see their opportunity to get things done and how either enable or impaired that it's going to be, and it's more of a perception from their perspective around what's happening than a specific number. So the sooner there is certainty about what's going to happen almost regardless of what that certainty is the more our clients can prioritize, I think we're well positioned. We're not going to be immune to cuts if there are cuts, but we're well positioned to be more resilient against that because we're at the center of the mission, doing unique and very important work. And that's -- so it really is how soon do we get to certainty. But overall, again, I'll leave you with a thought that we are guiding to a very strong set of numbers for FY'24, very strong organic revenue growth and really on track with what we said was our investment thesis goal for FY'25. So we're happy with where we are. Let me thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. As always, Matt and I are very proud of what the firm has accomplished and we're optimistic about the future. We have 32,000 people almost at Booz Allen now and they're working as hard as ever to serve our clients and to really change the world. And it's because of them really because of them that Booz Allen continues to thrive. So we look forward to another year of growth and success in fiscal year 2024 and to sharing information with you over time. Thank you again for joining and have a great day and a Happy Memorial Day."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. I too am very pleased with our operating and financial results. We had a strong fourth quarter, closing out an excellent fiscal year 2023 at both the top and the bottom lines. The momentum we built on both the supply side and the demand side, positions us well for the future as you will see in our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Booz Allen continues to produce industry-leading organic growth. Our margins are underpinned by the quality of our offerings and the strength of our execution. We are augmenting and accelerating our organic performance with a patient and disciplined capital deployment approach, and as a result, we remain on track to deliver on our multi-year investment thesis. I have a lot to cover today, so I will start by hitting the highlights of our fourth quarter performance then turn to our fiscal year 2023 results and finally close with our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our fourth quarter results were in-line with our expectations as we finished the fiscal year strong while investing in the talent and the capabilities to drive future growth. In the fourth quarter, we delivered overall revenue growth of 8.7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth of 7.7%. This performance was driven by continued headcount growth, a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.47 times, and client staff utilization that declined in the fourth quarter but is in line with our current growth posture. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew to $231 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This was a function of our overall growth, strong contract-level performance, and continued efforts to operate more efficiently. This translated to us generating $1.01 in ADEPS for the quarter, a growth of 17% year-over-year. In the quarter, we returned $191 million of capital to investors, primarily through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. And finally, we added over 800 net client staff in the quarter, a Q4 record due to strong hiring and seasonally low attrition. Now please turn to slide six, as I discuss our full fiscal year 2023 results. Total revenue for fiscal year 2023 grew 10.7% year-over-year to approximately $9.3 billion exceeding the top end of our guidance. Organic revenue growth was 9% year-over-year. And revenue excluding billable expenses grew 9.5% to approximately $6.5 billion. Our growth in fiscal year 2023 was broad-based. In Defense, revenue grew approximately 7% year-over-year. We are expanding our work at the core of national defense priorities, leveraging emerging technologies such as those Horacio described to transform missions and provide our Warfighters with decision advantage. Hiring remains a focus for our defense leaders, as their success to date has allowed us to ramp up new work and convert backlog. This business continues to accelerate. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 19% year-over-year. This growth was particularly strong in our health and citizen services accounts and across our cyber and digital services offerings. We continue to see growth in our civil markets with a healthy proposal pipeline and the talent needed to convert on existing backlog. In Intelligence, revenue grew by approximately 7% year-over-year. This business delivered flat revenue growth in the fourth quarter due to tough year-over-year comps in billable expenses and cost recovery on certain contracts. We expect modest growth in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, but this will taper during the year as our Intelligence business has seen higher-than-anticipated contract turnover. Our intel market leaders are focused on realizing the full value of the EverWatch transaction and repositioning our work against critical defense intelligence, national intelligence and cyber emissions. And finally, our global commercial revenue increased approximately 6% year-over-year. Our work providing critical cyber and incident response services to commercial clients and its connection to our government cyber mission remains a small but strategically important part of our overall portfolio. On the labor supply side, we ended the fiscal year with approximately 29,000 client staff, an increase of 10.6% year-over-year. Total headcount, inclusive of corporate staff, increased only 8.9% reflecting our ongoing focus on managing the business more efficiently. We continue to see both hiring momentum and significantly lower attrition rates compared to prior years. On the demand side, our strong backlog of work and a robust proposal pipeline provides good near-term visibility. We ended fiscal year 2023 with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.18 times. Our total backlog was $31.2 billion, up approximately 6.7% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 24.5% to $4.6 billion, unfunded backlog fell 4.1% to $9.5 billion and priced options grew 9.3% to $17.1 billion. Looking forward, our qualified pipeline of $46 billion is up approximately 14% compared to this time last year. With the current year budget in place, we are leaning into this pipeline to win as much work as possible and to get it on contract in advance of the coming budget negotiations. At the bottom line, we earned $1.014 billion in adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023, finishing at the high end of our guidance range. This is a year-over-year increase of 8.4%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was in line with our expectations and our guided range. Our net income decreased 41.9% year-over-year to $271 million. This was primarily a result of the $350 million legal reserve we recorded in connection with the ongoing DoJ matter in fiscal year 2023. Adjusted net income, which excludes this reserve, was up approximately 6.5% year-over-year to $605 million. Diluted earnings per share decreased 41% year-over-year to $2.03, primarily as a result of the aforementioned legal reserve. Excluding this reserve, adjusted diluted earnings per share or ADEPS increased 8.3% year-over-year to $4.56. Turning now to the balance sheet. We ended fiscal year 2023 with a cash balance of $405 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver. Free cash flow for the year was $527 million. This was the result of $603 million of cash generated from operating activities net of $76 million of CapEx. Our operating cash flow reflects our strong operating performance, offset by higher cash taxes due to the impact of Section 174, higher interest and higher spending on growth-oriented investments in our people and our business. Our net debt at the end of the fiscal year was approximately $2.4 billion and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.4 times adjusted EBITDA. Turning to slide eight. In fiscal year 2023, we deployed approximately $905 million of capital in a measured and balanced manner. This included approximately $440 million connected with the EverWatch acquisition, $236 million in cash dividends and $224 million in share repurchases at an average price of $91.83 per share. We remain patient and disciplined in our capital deployment approach as we navigate macroeconomic conditions, budget uncertainty and a challenging M&A environment. However, we remain focused on finding small to midsized tuck-in acquisitions that are consistent with our culture and VoLT strategy, active accelerants to growth and meet our financial parameters. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share that will be payable on June 30th to stockholders of record as of June 15th. Please turn now to slide nine for a discussion of our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As Horacio noted, we are entering into a period of uncertainty in our external environment. This is a familiar pattern for us. In recent years, we have typically guided to and planned for a strong first half and a more uncertain second half of our fiscal year. We are doing the same this year, as you will see reflected in our guidance and operating priorities. That said, we have significant momentum in our business, on the demand side, on the supply side and in our operations and we are well positioned relative to long-term demand trends. This supports fiscal year 2024 growth and profit guidance above the organic targets and our current investment thesis. At the top line, we are guiding to revenue growth of 7% to 11%, 6% to 10% of which will be organic. We expect to start the year at or above the top end of this range. Where we fall within this range for the fiscal year will depend on several factors, including the pace at which we can win work and get it on contract, the outcome of government funding and budgetary debates and the timing and extent to which we add consulting headcount throughout the year. At this point, we are targeting 3% to 5% growth for the full year, in line with historic patterns, but likely weighted towards the first half. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 10% to 11% range. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA dollar range of between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion or approximately 6% to 9% growth year-over-year. We expect ADEPS of between $4.80 per share and $4.95 per share or growth of approximately 5% to 9% year-over-year. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of between $500 million and $600 million and free cash flow of between $400 million and $500 million. This assumes a CapEx spend of approximately $100 million and this cash guidance reflects EBITDA growth offset by continued investments to grow our business, higher interest costs and temporarily higher cash taxes. In closing, I want to recognize our Booz Allen team for their hard work, dedication to mission and commitment to the firm. It is through their efforts that we had an excellent finish to our fiscal year 2023, built momentum that supports continued outperformance in fiscal year 2024 are well positioned against the most pressing needs of our clients and remain on track to achieve our multiyear investment thesis. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Good morning, Bert. Yeah, good question.  we said we're targeting free cash flow yield of approximately 10% excluding 174. In '23, we delivered 110%, which was great, and we are going to be below that in '24 for a couple of reasons that we think are temporal. We are seeing an increase in working capital consistent with the rapidly growing business, particularly on the outlay side. Second and we talked about this last year, but there's some timing related issues related to some tax strategies we've been discussing. This year, we're going to have an incremental $50 million in cash taxes, but likely with no corresponding offset related to those tax strategies. But I will point you to an approximately $150 million receivable on our balance sheet that we do anticipate receiving in future years. And then obviously, we, like everyone else, are experiencing higher interest expenses. So I do expect, Sheila, to be in a meaningfully better position in FY'25 as some of this is temporal. And reading between the lines, I think you're trying to get at, do we expect to see margin pressure? And clearly, in our guidance this year, the answer to that is no. We're guiding to -- from high 10s to the 11% range. And embedded in that, we've anticipated the defense business is going to accelerate. And I just want to double-click on what Horacio said. We're operating the business very efficiently. And I feel like we've got our hands on a lot of the levers with respect to labor economics but also some of our corporate costs. And that just gives us a lot of optionality. Yes, Horacio, do you want to take Focus Fox first? And Cai to specifically answer to your question about EDOS and EDITS they were included in our Q4 book-to-bill. On the margins, but we're seeing acceleration in defense. And so the two will probably wash out. Thanks. I think we're seeing an environment that is pretty consistent with what we've seen in the last couple of quarters, which is a lot of -- it's a small to midsized opportunities, but both buyers and sellers that are being judicious in how they approach the M&A environment. So we're actively engaged in a lot of processes. We've gone reasonably far down the path in a couple of these. But I think we said or I said measured and balanced in the script just to sort of break it up from seeing patient discipline, but we're going to remain patient and disciplined. We've got industry-leading organic growth. We've got a strong balance sheet. If you look at how we deployed capital in '23 or even in Q4 of '23, it was very balanced and we're committed to deploying capital in a measured way to drive long-term shareholder value. Yes. Well, I think we've come in ahead of that the last couple of years, and we're guiding ahead of the mid-10s this year. And so clearly that's a reflection not just to the quality of the work we're selling and our contract execution, but how we're managing our cost base. Good morning. Yes, I'm not going to give you much more than I want to have to-date. We'll look at getting out some more detailed guidance in the appropriate forums. But essentially, the bridge is threefold, right? Higher interest, higher taxes with no corresponding offset this year, but we anticipate something in FY'25 or beyond and higher outlays consistent with the working capital required to fund a growing business where 30% of your work is done through subs. And if you think about the leading-edge capabilities that Horacio has talked about, a lot of them have been really built and incubated into our Intel business. So in terms of the role it plays in our portfolio, historically, it has not grown as quickly as other portions of our portfolio, largely because of supply constraints in a highly clear environment. But the capabilities that the Intel business develops and we export across the remainder of our business in addition to the people Horacio described really are fundamental."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. With me today to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking, and may relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our filings with the SEC and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings release and slides. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Matt and I are very pleased to share exceptional results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. These results show Booz Allen is gaining momentum. We are positioned well for the remainder of this fiscal year, and on track to achieve our investment thesis. This quarter, we delivered industry-leading double-digit organic revenue growth. Our strong demand momentum and continued acceleration in hiring bolster our confidence as we look ahead. Given the strength of our performance, we are making positive adjustments to our guidance ranges, which Matt will discuss in a few minutes. Additionally, and as you may have seen, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to investment grade last week. This is a reflection of our strong track record of growth and our consistent financial performance. Today, Matt and I will discuss these results in the context of our investment thesis. I will also update you on the progress we are making on VoLT, focusing on how we continue to outpace the market through the Velocity dimension of our strategy. Let's begin with our investment thesis. At our Investor Day in October of 2021, we laid out our plan to grow adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We said, we expected to achieve that goal through the combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth; strong and stable margins, allowing for continued investment in our people, innovation and infrastructure; and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. The results of the last several quarters put us on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA targets. On balance, we see more momentum on organic growth and profit than we originally anticipated. And while acquisitions remain a priority, the pace of M&A has been slower than we originally expected. We will continue to move strongly on both fronts in the coming quarters. Diving deeper into our current operational performance. Let me highlight the following areas of momentum. First, our hiring results are exceptional. We grew client staff 7.5% year-over-year and continue to quickly place new hires into billable roles. Second, and despite a relatively light book-to-bill ratio this quarter, demand remains strong. This is reflected in our trailing 12 months book-to-bill and a robust pipeline, which includes several large pending near-term awards. Additionally, with the federal budget in place, our clients have clarity on the resources available to invest in their priorities, further strengthening the demand picture. And third, we are operating faster and more efficiently by empowering our decision-makers and streamlining internal workflows. As a result, even with significant inflationary pressure, our corporate costs are growing well below our revenue growth rate, creating additional capacity for investment. These operational metrics give me confidence of continued momentum in the business. One additional note on the financials we are reporting today. In our 10-Q, we disclosed we have entered into settlement discussions with the Department of Justice related to their investigation into certain elements of our cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices. We are exploring whether a negotiated resolution to the matter is possible with the DOJ. In connection with those discussions, we recorded a reserve for $124 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. At this time, we do not know if or when a settlement might be achieved, and if achieved, with the total dollar amount might be. Before turning the call over to Matt, let me take a few moments to update you on VoLT. Over a decade ago, Booz Allen correctly anticipated that technology would become the dominant force in the success of the federal government's core missions. We prepared for that evolution and established a unique position in the market. Today, as the change we saw coming is upon us, we have first-mover advantage and are a recognized leader in driving technology adoption in the government. In this moment, when technology has become a catalyst for mission success, speed is key. Technology, missions and the competitive environment are all changing more rapidly in this next evolution of the market. In response, the V for Velocity in VoLT, represents our imperative to get faster and stay ahead of the pace of change. So in addition to faster decision-making and streamlined internal processes, Velocity includes two market focused dimensions. The first is leveraging technology to accelerate organic growth, and the second is using M&A as a strategic accelerator. Our aerospace business helps illustrate the first point on accelerating organic growth. As an example, earlier this fiscal year, we reported winning the CyPrESS contract, which is transforming how cyber is delivered across the entire NASA enterprise. Our investments and experience innovating in the most complex cyber missions uniquely positions us to win this work. We have quickly hired and ramped up on this contract, and are now one of the main providers of cybersecurity at NASA fully engaged in protecting the space agency's assets and infrastructure. In other parts of aerospace, we're also leveraging technology to evolve the mission. We are accelerating digital transformation across the Air Force's weapons, enterprise and test ranges. And in today, rapidly evolving threat environment, we are helping our clients re-imagine the future of secure communications on military aircraft platforms. From exciting new wins, to expanding on decades-long work, we are inserting new technology across Air Force, Space Force and NASA missions. And as a result, our aerospace business has accelerated from flat to double-digit organic growth over the past two years. Let's turn now to the second dimension of Velocity, using M&A as a strategic accelerator. EverWatch is our most recent example of this. We are pleased to have completed the acquisition in October, and integration is underway. Through EverWatch, we gained access to classified software development capabilities to support national security missions faster than we could have built and scaled them on our own. At a time when mission success or failure is dependent on the right technology, acquisitions like EverWatch help us bring innovation to missions at speed. We continue to build our M&A pipeline with a focus on acquisitions that have potential to accelerate our organic growth. One final point to close. In December, I participated in the Reagan National Defense Forum, with some of our most senior clients, industry colleagues and legislators. Our discussions centered largely on how technology is fundamentally redefining the battlefield and what we need to do as a nation to be better prepared to stay ahead of facing threats, especially China. These conversations, like many I have with our clients across defense, intelligence and civil agencies, reinforced for me, the technology has gone from an enabler of mission to a catalyst of mission success. Thus, I believe the investments Booz Allen has made over the past decade, combined with our continued progress on VoLT, and of course, our incredible people, uniquely position us to accelerate into the next decade, outpace our competitors and make the greatest difference through the work we do for all our clients. And with that, Matt, over to you to take us through the financial results.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. As Horacio noted, we are extremely pleased with our financial results, both for the third quarter and for our fiscal year-to-date. We remain the industry's organic growth leader and continue to operate the business very well. We have built excellent momentum toward reaching our fiscal year and investment thesis objectives, and we expect this momentum to continue given our strategic positioning, our strong execution and a positive budget environment through the end of the government fiscal year. Before discussing our third quarter results in detail, I will highlight a few key areas of our fiscal year-to-date performance. Over the first three quarters, we delivered 9.5% organic revenue growth. This is a result of us winning work aligned with our VoLT strategy and hiring, retaining and efficiently deploying the right talent. Our adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.5% in this period reflect continued strong contract level execution and prudent cost management. We deployed $714 million of capital through three quarters, a combination of dividends, share repurchases and the strategic acquisition of EverWatch. As a result, Booz Allen remains on track to achieve our investment thesis goals and to continue delivering excellent value to our shareholders. Now please turn to Slide 6, as I discuss our third quarter results in detail. At the top line, total revenue in the third quarter grew 12.1% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 11.2% to $1.6 billion. Almost all of this growth was organic, as our organic growth accelerated to 11.6% for the quarter. I am particularly pleased that our revenue growth was driven by double-digit contributions from each of our three federal markets. In Defense, revenue grew approximately 10% year-over-year led by strong performance in our Aerospace and Joint Combatant Command accounts. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 16% year-over-year, highlighted by growth in our health account, and in the mission-critical cyber and digital solutions work we perform across the civil market. In our Intelligence business, we grew by approximately 14% year-over-year, driven by our National Cyber and Defense Intelligence accounts, as well as our strong hiring across the board. At this point, we expect a stand-alone fiscal year 2024 contribution from EverWatch of between $180 million and $200 million. Our Global Commercial business, which accounted for roughly 3% of our revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 13% year-over-year. This reflects the sale of our MENA and Managed Threat Services businesses in the second and third quarters, respectively, that streamlined our commercial business and positioned it well for future growth. On the labor supply side, our client staff headcount grew to 28,269 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 1,975 employee\u2019s year-over-year, or 7.5%. Total headcount, inclusive of corporate staff increased to 31,130, this equates to growth of 1,677 employees year-over-year, or 5.7%. These figures included over 400 employees who joined at Booz Allen from EverWatch in the third quarter, as well as the approximately 80 employees who left the firm with our MTS divestiture. The transformation of our talent acquisition life cycle and improved levels of attrition in the quarter drove this continued acceleration in headcount. These results show that we continue to attract and retain the high end talent we need, even in an extremely competitive labor market. On the demand side, net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $197 million, which translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.09 times. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill metric remained solid at over 1.2 times. This is the best indicator of sustained demand as it normalizes for quarter-to-quarter volatility. We can attribute our relatively light book-to-bill number this quarter to two factors. First, seasonality, as this is consistent with our historical bookings pattern. And second, the timing of a few large awards and protest resolutions that were pushed into the fourth quarter. This timing dynamic includes a large contract award in our intelligence market that Horacio referenced in our last earnings call. This award, which has meaningful overlap with work we are performing today is currently under re-evaluation. In the quarter, total backlog grew to $30 billion, which is approximately 8.2% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 12.4% to $4.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 7.6% to $10.1 billion and priced options grew 7.5% to $15.4 billion. We are very comfortable that this backlog and the strength of our proposal and award pipeline support our near and medium term growth aspirations. Consistent with our strong top line performance, we generated $244 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, up 9.8% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA margin reflects a mix of drivers with strong contract level performance and solid cost management, offset by a higher billable expense mix, higher unallowable spend, and the impact of wage inflation on our fixed price and time and materials contracts. Our net income decreased 76.2% year-over-year to $31 million. This was primarily a result of the $124 million legal reserve, we recorded this quarter in connection with the DOJ matter. Adjusted net income, which excludes this legal reserve was approximately $142 million, up 4% year-over-year. These were driven by our strong operating results, which were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 75.8% compared to the prior year period to $0.23, primarily as a result of the aforementioned legal reserve. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the legal reserve, increased 4.9% year-over-year to $1.07. Turning now to the balance sheet. We closed the third quarter with a cash balance of $371 million, and a $1 billion untapped revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was $117 million, the result of $139 million in cash from operating activities, net of $22 million of capital expenditures. Operating cash was supported by collections that kept pace with our revenue growth, but with seasonally light due to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses paid out in the quarter. Now turning to Slide 8. During the third quarter, we deployed $510 million of capital. This included approximately $440 million connected with the EverWatch acquisition, $11 million in share repurchases at an average price of $96.30 per share, and $57 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.5 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times. As Horacio mentioned, we were delighted by last week's news from Standard & Poor's, who upgraded us to BBB minus and investment-grade credit rating. We look forward to the enhanced flexibility and access to capital markets that this upgrade will provide, and we will continue to be good stewards of our balance sheet, while deploying capital in a patient and disciplined manner. To this end, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a $0.04 increase to our quarterly dividend. This dividend of $0.47 per share will be payable on March 1st to stockholders of record as of February 10. Finally, let me summarize our updated guidance for full fiscal year 2023. Please turn now to Slide 9. Our excellent performance and sustained momentum through the first three quarters give us confidence in our ability to finish this fiscal year strong. At the top line, we are increasing our guidance for full fiscal year revenue growth to between 9.5% and 10.5%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has one fewer working day when compared to the prior fiscal year, which impacts year-over-year quarterly growth comparisons. We still expect margins to be in the range of high 10% to low 11%. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $995 million and $1.15 billion in sync with the increase in our top line guidance. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of between $4.35 and $4.50 per share. We now expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $90 million for the fiscal year. And lastly, our fiscal year 2023 operating cash flow guidance remains unchanged from last quarter. In closing, like Horacio, I really want to thank our dedicated employees, whose relentless focus on the mission is really the root of our outstanding performance. Because of them, Booz Allen remains on track to achieve our investment thesis goals and to continue to deliver excellent shareholder value. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu [Jefferies]. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, everyone. And....\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey. Sheila...\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for the time. So, Horacio, in your opening remarks, you mentioned M&A as a strategic accelerator, and you typically haven't done deals, but you're focused on them now. Can you maybe give us an update on Liberty and Tracepoint, as well as EverWatch, given you just closed the books on that one? And it seems like the revenue contribution is coming in a lot better there?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes, absolutely. So let me start by saying, we're very happy with the results of the quarter and particularly happy with the organic performance of the business, which is really ahead of our expectations at this point on the trajectory of our investment thesis. And as I mentioned on the opening remarks, we are a little bit behind where we thought we would be at this point on the M&A side, largely environmental factors. But overall, we're very pleased with what we are on the journey, and we're on track. And that's really the key message. One click down from that. As I mentioned, now work backwards, EverWatch is finally closed in October, we're integrating it. There was a little degradation of talent levels, while we were waiting for it to close. And so we're accelerating their hiring because they have pretty robust demand there that we want to meet, and that's where that is. Tracepoint is getting fully integrated into our commercial business. As you know, that is a small acquisition and a small business, but it's an important capability as we do incident response more aggressively across the commercial market. And then Liberty, which is now fully integrated into our business, has been an extraordinary success and continues to be - they are - it's a big part of our health team. They brought low code, no code capability that is both really valuable across the health account, but really increasingly across the federal government, and we're really pleased with that. So overall, we're looking to do more things that look like Liberty. They're hard to find. And we're - as Matt always says, we're going to be patient and disciplined on this, and that's where we're going.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for that. Maybe if I could follow-up just on the civil business as a whole, which clearly includes Liberty. You mentioned, I mean, the business is growing at a spectacular mid-teens rate. So what's sort of driving that? You mentioned health and cyber mission work. Is it a few contracts? Or is it just you're going into new addressable markets there?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's broad-based. I think that's a great question. I think this speaks to really VoLT and Velocity and everything else that we are doing across the business. This notion of inserting new technology into existing missions really resonates with our clients. It's what they need to do to meet the demands of the moment. I honestly believe it is what's driving this double-digit growth that we experienced this quarter and really the broad-based growth across many parts our portfolio. In civil, in particular, it's not just health. There is significant elements of our treasury business that are growing very well. And we're happy with what we're seeing. I mean, the civil agencies are focused on digital transformation. They need to be, and we like to believe that we are a catalyst and a partner with them on this journey, and that's what underlies our growth opportunity.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question will come from Bert Subin of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hi, Bret, good morning.\nBert Subin: Hey, Horacio, you noted before and you've noted over time the Booz is supply not demand constrained. Now you just grew client staff down kind of almost 4% quarter-over-quarter, which is clearly benefiting sales. Do you have any concern that pendulum starts to swing the other way and utilization becomes a factor, maybe not this quarter, but as we go further into the calendar year?\nHoracio Rozanski: That's a great question. And here, I want to give credit to really our team and operating teams, the work that Kristine Martin Anderson and our people team are doing. They really have re-wire the way we hire to - against the velocity dimension, so that we actually can hire faster. And then - and this is really mentioned, we really haven't spent as much time before so that we can put people that are hired into billable opportunities faster. And I think we're seeing some benefit of that. The other benefit is demand, as I mentioned, is very strong across the board. And so I'm not sure even if we wanted to, that we could keep people on the bench very long. So you put all of that together and at least for the moment because who can predict the long-term future, there's a lot of momentum in the business. And we are doing this - we're seeing this dynamic where we're hiring at almost record levels or at record levels, and we're placing people on contract fast enough that our billability or utilization is remaining very, very high. So again, when we talk about confidence and momentum in the business, that's - I think that's what's underneath a lot of our words.\nBert Subin: So maybe just for my follow-up. You also mentioned during your prepared remarks, greater clarity for your customers post budget in late December. Have you noted any acceleration in spending following the passage of the budget? And if you haven't, when would you expect that to start materializing? I could that provide some acceleration from the already high growth you're seeing.\nHoracio Rozanski: I - we have not seen a significant change. I think what we have seen is a steadiness and confidence that the emissions that they're focused on are going to be supported at least through the balance of the current fiscal year. And so I think that's been positive. As we've noted and others have, the award environment isn't the fastest we've ever seen in terms of things moving to the ride and protests and all of that. That seems to continue. But against an overall very strong demand backdrop, as you can tell by our numbers, we're obviously not demand constrained. We're doing really well on hiring. And when you put it all together, again, it's a story of both momentum that we've seen over the last few quarters, and we expect - or we hope to continue.\nBert Subin: Thank you, Horacio.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question will come from Louie DiPalma of William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Good morning, Horacio, Matt, Nathan and Meg [ph]\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Louie.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: Horacio, near the end of last quarter, you secured a $2.2 billion contract called Morphick. That seems pretty strategic in addition to being one of your largest ever awards. Was this contract a big driver of your strong organic growth in the December quarter? And can you provide more detail about what the contract pertains?\nHoracio Rozanski: So we were a little limited in terms of what we can say about that particular contract. It's - I guess, what I will say is it's still - it's over piece of all of the work that we keep talking about where we're bringing leading-edge technology into existing mission sets, programs of that size ramp slowly. I think the message I would likely to take away is the growth that we're seeing is broad-based. That's obviously a defense contract. And as you can see, both civil and security also posted very strong growth. So we're seeing strong demand across really, I can't say it's every single part of our business, but lots of aspects of our business. And the team is doing a great job of hiring against our demand, bringing in the right people, with the right clearances and the right technical expertise, so that we can ramp up and continue the momentum.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And for Matt, I think you mentioned the possibility of accelerating M&A in the future quarters. Should we expect acquisitions to be small sub $1 billion type so that they are easily digestible? Or do you have any aspirations for a much larger transformative acquisition?\nMatt Calderone: Thanks, Louie. Never say never. But I think right now, we're more focused on small to mid sized tuck-ins that are strategic accelerants. We're really pleased with our capital deployment to date, deployed $510 million in the quarter, including EverWatch. And as Horacio said, they've got some short-term hurdles they need to overcome on the supply side. But from a demand perspective and in terms of long-term strategic value, we really see it as an opportunity for us to transform portions of our intelligence business. So we're working it. We've got a pipeline. As you know, the M&A market has been and relatively slow in the past couple of quarters for a handful of macroeconomic reasons. But we're going to play the game that's in front of us. And the strength of our balance sheet just gives us a lot of flexibility to do that.\nLouie DiPalma: Thanks, Matt. And thanks, Horacio.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thanks, Louie.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question will come from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen. Your line is open.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hi, Cai, good morning.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much. Yes. Good morning, guys. So you mentioned protest is a reason for the soft bookings. Could you walk through the large Intel contract, is that one that you were awarded and now is being - is under protest and maybe give us some color on some of the others, too, if you could?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think, generally speaking, this is what I can tell you. I think the contract that you're describing, I mentioned briefly last call and Matt talked about it in the prepared remarks, it relates to our cyber work in the Intel market and has overlap with some of our existing contract. The award was pulled back and it's been re-evaluated. So it's not technically under protest. And so we - as you know, because you've followed us for a very long time, we generally don't comment on specific procurements, while they're under evaluation. Here's what I can tell you about the processing well, about this dynamic in particular and then the broader environment. The - as you know, we're not demand constrained. We have $30 billion in backlog. And even with our record hiring, we're still having filled every rec. And the place where it's hardest for us to recruit is in clear technical staff for work in the intelligence community. And so we still have a lot of open recs there and now a significant volume of open recs had EverWatch. So our goal ultimately in this area is to retain and grow that workforce and deploy it against the work that is in front of us, I think we're doing well there. There's more work to do because, ultimately, we want to continue to grow that workforce as the way which we grow the Intel business overall. And then the last point I would make on the protest environment overall, that continues to be a slow process. We have a number of things that have slid to the right as a result of that. I think that we are very optimistic about the awards picture in the near term, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we're feeling good about the overall demand picture and the momentum that we have.\nCai von Rumohr: One broad follow-up. It seems like there's plenty of money around to make awards, but sort of across the industry, it seems like the activity is a bit slower. Some of your peers have talked about the lack of contracting officers. And as you know, the process to become a contracting officer is pretty onerous. Do you see that as a problem that there's just not enough qualified people to kind of make the awards, and that's 1 of the reasons things are slowing?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes, to the extent that the contracting workforce in the government has been constrained for a long time, and they've been under pressure for a long time. Again, you and I have been on these calls for a while, I mean there was a time where, for example, the department wanted to re-compete things more often. And so that increased the workforce or the workload on the contracting shops significantly without a corresponding increase on the headcount that needed to address that from the government side. And that's been a perennial issue. I don't know that it is any worse now than it's been in the past. Again, ultimately, from our perspective, the - I'm sorry, I'm saying it again, but the demand picture right now feels very strong.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question will come from Matt Akers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nEric Allen: Good morning. This is Eric Allen for Matt. Just a quick follow-up on book-to-bill. I know it's more of a timing thing, but was there anything taken out of the backlog, any cancellations there?\nMatt Calderone: No, nothing meaningful. I think the top line message is we have the backlog and the award and proposal pipeline we need to meet our near and medium-term growth aspirations. And even more important, the capabilities and solutions we're building in line with our VoLT strategy are really resonating with our clients. So we said it both in stronger quarters like Q2 and lighter quarters like this one that we want to focus - we focus on last 12 months book-to-bill. And if you look back at where we were at the end of Q3, the prior fiscal \u2013 three fiscal years, that was between, let's say, 1.15 and 1.3 and right now, we're at 1.22. So we're right in line with where we want to be and Q4 is shaping up well.\nEric Allen: Okay. Thanks. If I could do one more. I think we're seeing more military aid packages being sent to Ukraine lately. So just wondering, if you're seeing any benefit from all the support money?\nHoracio Rozanski: I had the pleasure of spending time with our team in Europe late last year and just be inspired and amazed by the work that they're doing in support of our government as our government supports Ukraine. And so we're well deployed in the middle of that mission, helping drive intelligence, helping drive analysis and doing really good work. So overall, that - sort of that's our posture. It's a posture that is longstanding. It's a longstanding team that has pivoted to this mission. There's obviously been some growth on the team as a result of additional mission needs. I would expect that to continue. But I don't see that as a meaningful driver of growth as much as I see it as a real demonstration of the great work that we got on people can do as we bring technology to the mission needs.\nEric Allen: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment. And our next question will come from Tobey Sommer of Truist. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about the debt ceiling negotiation. As these proceeds, but do you have see any risk to the spending patterns in the current fiscal year as procurement officers' kind of watch this being bantered about in the news? And are there any analog experiences in history that you would reference as sort of being benchmarks or examples of how impacts either emerge or don't?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's really hard to predict that what will happen sort of second and third order effects of the debt ceiling debate. It's even hard to understand what the first order effects will be. I will say this. I mean, obviously, a protracted fight on that in our view is not good for the country, and it's certainly not good for our clients and by extension is not great for us. I think part of our approach to all of this is - and this is why - is to build momentum to drive the business that's in front of us, to grow organically, to have the right people doing the right work at the center of these missions, which tends to be more resilient to overall sort of external uncertainty. That's what we have done in the past. That's what we are doing now. And that's what gives us confidence that despite the fact that there's that issue, there's next year's government budget and all of that, which are things that we are watching very closely. Ultimately, we are on track and remain on track to deliver our investment thesis to advance VoLT and to be the kind of partner to our clients that they need us to be right now.\nMatt Calderone: And the industry has a lot of experience, unfortunately, with budgetary uncertainty. We have it. Others in the industry have it. And as Horacio said, we've told the team is play the game in front of us. And the best thing we can do is to prepare for uncertainty is to build as strong a business as possible. And we feel like we're well positioned strategically through Volt, as Horacio mentioned, and our client positioning operationally. We're running the business very, very well. I think more disciplined than we've ever run it. And financially, given the strength of our performance and the quality of our balance sheet. And we sort of glossed over it because there's a lot of news in the quarter, but I think us being upgraded to investment grade is a reflection of that.\nTobey Sommer: Absolutely. As you look at your principal government customer sets in civil, defense and Intel, how would you stratify the growth prospects for calendar '23? And does it sort of purely map against headline budget outlays and growth this year? Or is there a nuance or difference among them?\nHoracio Rozanski: You know, from my perspective - well, first of all, as you see, we have strong growth across the board right now. And the type of work that we are doing under VoLT, the work we're positioned to do, again, around bringing AI, cyber, digital transformation into existing missions, into expanded mission scopes around space, around INDOPACOM in China around some of the key issues, which at some level are some of the few bipartisans remaining give us confidence that we are doing the right work and in the right place. And at least for the immediate future, the increases in head count and the speed at which our headcount is - our people are getting on programs give us confidence that the business has strength. And that's our approach, and it's not limited to one small piece or another. It's where - we believe that's a broad-based view.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nOperator: And one moment. Our next question will come from Mariana Perez Mora from Bank of America. Your line is open, Mariana.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMariana Perez Mora: So my question is about free cash flow in order for - to get to hit your cash from operations outlook, you have to generate more than $200 million net of a fair amount of tax payments. Could you please give us some color on how to bridge to that $200 million-plus free cash flow generation?\nMatt Calderone: Happy to. Our cash performance year-to-date has been solid. Again, that's why we reiterated guidance. Thankfully, we took a conservative approach and didn't assume 174 would be repealed. So we anticipate, and you see that in the bridge we provide an - we provided in the presentation initially 174 being about 170 - about $140 million this year, and we have $175 million of other cash taxes. So to get to the bridge that you described, we're obviously growing, and collections are keeping pace with growth in Q3. Outlays were also up, including a couple of things that were temporal. So we feel like we've got the ability to generate cash and invest in the business and hit our targets in the guidance.\nMariana Perez Mora: Thank you. And then a follow-up to Tobey's question on consumer resolution or like this potential year-long continue resolution next year. I understand that the right strategy is prepared to the future and not for the headwinds of the process to get to that future. But can you help us understand, how much of a headwind could be a year-long Continuous [ph] solution into your organic growth?\nHoracio Rozanski: At this point, I think it's a little premature to try and speculate what the budget picture will look like next year and how it might play out. I think as just Matt pointed out, we and the industry have become very adept at managing through this budget turbulence. We - and I think that's ultimately what we are focused on, I think when we get closer, if we know more and there's more clarity, we'll be happy to engage at that time. The one thing I can tell you is our business right now is doing well, their strength on the demand side, their strength in the supply side, their strength on the balance sheet. And all of that strength put together give us confidence that within reason, we can - we're preparing well to weather a storm and deliver on our investment thesis commitments through FY '25.\nMariana Perez Mora: Perfect. Thank you very much for the color.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As we come to a close on this call, let me first recognize that we have a new member of our Board of Directors. As we announced last week, Rory Read has joined the Booz Allen Board. Rory is Senior Vice President at Ericsson and the President and CEO of Vonage, which is Ericsson's global telecommunication platform. I'm really excited to have Rory on our Board and I'm already seeing how we benefit from his expertise, both as a technologist and as a business leader. And then lastly, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and recognize and thank the amazing people of Booz Allen. For sure, for their hard work and dedication because it's their hard work and dedication that delivers the exceptional results, we were able to discuss with you today. And also for their generosity and what they do for the communities in which they live and work. And specifically, through our year-end giving campaign, our employees contributed more than $1 million think about that word, more than $1 million to the causes that they are most passionate about. And because of the firm's match, we ultimately gave over $2 million to more than 2,000 non-profit organizations, and this is the highest impact we have ever made through year-end campaign. Our people's commitment and service to our communities, to our clients, to each other, they're the core of who we are. They are the core of our purpose and our values. So I come to work every day, it is really my colleagues that inspire me. So I just want to say, once again, thank you. Thank you, Booz Allen. And on that note, thanks again to all of you for joining us, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Matt and I are very pleased to share exceptional results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. These results show Booz Allen is gaining momentum. We are positioned well for the remainder of this fiscal year, and on track to achieve our investment thesis. This quarter, we delivered industry-leading double-digit organic revenue growth. Our strong demand momentum and continued acceleration in hiring bolster our confidence as we look ahead. Given the strength of our performance, we are making positive adjustments to our guidance ranges, which Matt will discuss in a few minutes. Additionally, and as you may have seen, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating to investment grade last week. This is a reflection of our strong track record of growth and our consistent financial performance. Today, Matt and I will discuss these results in the context of our investment thesis. I will also update you on the progress we are making on VoLT, focusing on how we continue to outpace the market through the Velocity dimension of our strategy. Let's begin with our investment thesis. At our Investor Day in October of 2021, we laid out our plan to grow adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We said, we expected to achieve that goal through the combination of industry-leading organic revenue growth; strong and stable margins, allowing for continued investment in our people, innovation and infrastructure; and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. The results of the last several quarters put us on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA targets. On balance, we see more momentum on organic growth and profit than we originally anticipated. And while acquisitions remain a priority, the pace of M&A has been slower than we originally expected. We will continue to move strongly on both fronts in the coming quarters. Diving deeper into our current operational performance. Let me highlight the following areas of momentum. First, our hiring results are exceptional. We grew client staff 7.5% year-over-year and continue to quickly place new hires into billable roles. Second, and despite a relatively light book-to-bill ratio this quarter, demand remains strong. This is reflected in our trailing 12 months book-to-bill and a robust pipeline, which includes several large pending near-term awards. Additionally, with the federal budget in place, our clients have clarity on the resources available to invest in their priorities, further strengthening the demand picture. And third, we are operating faster and more efficiently by empowering our decision-makers and streamlining internal workflows. As a result, even with significant inflationary pressure, our corporate costs are growing well below our revenue growth rate, creating additional capacity for investment. These operational metrics give me confidence of continued momentum in the business. One additional note on the financials we are reporting today. In our 10-Q, we disclosed we have entered into settlement discussions with the Department of Justice related to their investigation into certain elements of our cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices. We are exploring whether a negotiated resolution to the matter is possible with the DOJ. In connection with those discussions, we recorded a reserve for $124 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. At this time, we do not know if or when a settlement might be achieved, and if achieved, with the total dollar amount might be. Before turning the call over to Matt, let me take a few moments to update you on VoLT. Over a decade ago, Booz Allen correctly anticipated that technology would become the dominant force in the success of the federal government's core missions. We prepared for that evolution and established a unique position in the market. Today, as the change we saw coming is upon us, we have first-mover advantage and are a recognized leader in driving technology adoption in the government. In this moment, when technology has become a catalyst for mission success, speed is key. Technology, missions and the competitive environment are all changing more rapidly in this next evolution of the market. In response, the V for Velocity in VoLT, represents our imperative to get faster and stay ahead of the pace of change. So in addition to faster decision-making and streamlined internal processes, Velocity includes two market focused dimensions. The first is leveraging technology to accelerate organic growth, and the second is using M&A as a strategic accelerator. Our aerospace business helps illustrate the first point on accelerating organic growth. As an example, earlier this fiscal year, we reported winning the CyPrESS contract, which is transforming how cyber is delivered across the entire NASA enterprise. Our investments and experience innovating in the most complex cyber missions uniquely positions us to win this work. We have quickly hired and ramped up on this contract, and are now one of the main providers of cybersecurity at NASA fully engaged in protecting the space agency's assets and infrastructure. In other parts of aerospace, we're also leveraging technology to evolve the mission. We are accelerating digital transformation across the Air Force's weapons, enterprise and test ranges. And in today, rapidly evolving threat environment, we are helping our clients re-imagine the future of secure communications on military aircraft platforms. From exciting new wins, to expanding on decades-long work, we are inserting new technology across Air Force, Space Force and NASA missions. And as a result, our aerospace business has accelerated from flat to double-digit organic growth over the past two years. Let's turn now to the second dimension of Velocity, using M&A as a strategic accelerator. EverWatch is our most recent example of this. We are pleased to have completed the acquisition in October, and integration is underway. Through EverWatch, we gained access to classified software development capabilities to support national security missions faster than we could have built and scaled them on our own. At a time when mission success or failure is dependent on the right technology, acquisitions like EverWatch help us bring innovation to missions at speed. We continue to build our M&A pipeline with a focus on acquisitions that have potential to accelerate our organic growth. One final point to close. In December, I participated in the Reagan National Defense Forum, with some of our most senior clients, industry colleagues and legislators. Our discussions centered largely on how technology is fundamentally redefining the battlefield and what we need to do as a nation to be better prepared to stay ahead of facing threats, especially China. These conversations, like many I have with our clients across defense, intelligence and civil agencies, reinforced for me, the technology has gone from an enabler of mission to a catalyst of mission success. Thus, I believe the investments Booz Allen has made over the past decade, combined with our continued progress on VoLT, and of course, our incredible people, uniquely position us to accelerate into the next decade, outpace our competitors and make the greatest difference through the work we do for all our clients. And with that, Matt, over to you to take us through the financial results. Hey. Sheila... Yes, absolutely. So let me start by saying, we're very happy with the results of the quarter and particularly happy with the organic performance of the business, which is really ahead of our expectations at this point on the trajectory of our investment thesis. And as I mentioned on the opening remarks, we are a little bit behind where we thought we would be at this point on the M&A side, largely environmental factors. But overall, we're very pleased with what we are on the journey, and we're on track. And that's really the key message. One click down from that. As I mentioned, now work backwards, EverWatch is finally closed in October, we're integrating it. There was a little degradation of talent levels, while we were waiting for it to close. And so we're accelerating their hiring because they have pretty robust demand there that we want to meet, and that's where that is. Tracepoint is getting fully integrated into our commercial business. As you know, that is a small acquisition and a small business, but it's an important capability as we do incident response more aggressively across the commercial market. And then Liberty, which is now fully integrated into our business, has been an extraordinary success and continues to be - they are - it's a big part of our health team. They brought low code, no code capability that is both really valuable across the health account, but really increasingly across the federal government, and we're really pleased with that. So overall, we're looking to do more things that look like Liberty. They're hard to find. And we're - as Matt always says, we're going to be patient and disciplined on this, and that's where we're going. It's broad-based. I think that's a great question. I think this speaks to really VoLT and Velocity and everything else that we are doing across the business. This notion of inserting new technology into existing missions really resonates with our clients. It's what they need to do to meet the demands of the moment. I honestly believe it is what's driving this double-digit growth that we experienced this quarter and really the broad-based growth across many parts our portfolio. In civil, in particular, it's not just health. There is significant elements of our treasury business that are growing very well. And we're happy with what we're seeing. I mean, the civil agencies are focused on digital transformation. They need to be, and we like to believe that we are a catalyst and a partner with them on this journey, and that's what underlies our growth opportunity. Thank you. Hi, Bret, good morning. That's a great question. And here, I want to give credit to really our team and operating teams, the work that Kristine Martin Anderson and our people team are doing. They really have re-wire the way we hire to - against the velocity dimension, so that we actually can hire faster. And then - and this is really mentioned, we really haven't spent as much time before so that we can put people that are hired into billable opportunities faster. And I think we're seeing some benefit of that. The other benefit is demand, as I mentioned, is very strong across the board. And so I'm not sure even if we wanted to, that we could keep people on the bench very long. So you put all of that together and at least for the moment because who can predict the long-term future, there's a lot of momentum in the business. And we are doing this - we're seeing this dynamic where we're hiring at almost record levels or at record levels, and we're placing people on contract fast enough that our billability or utilization is remaining very, very high. So again, when we talk about confidence and momentum in the business, that's - I think that's what's underneath a lot of our words. I - we have not seen a significant change. I think what we have seen is a steadiness and confidence that the emissions that they're focused on are going to be supported at least through the balance of the current fiscal year. And so I think that's been positive. As we've noted and others have, the award environment isn't the fastest we've ever seen in terms of things moving to the ride and protests and all of that. That seems to continue. But against an overall very strong demand backdrop, as you can tell by our numbers, we're obviously not demand constrained. We're doing really well on hiring. And when you put it all together, again, it's a story of both momentum that we've seen over the last few quarters, and we expect - or we hope to continue. Thank you. Good morning, Louie. So we were a little limited in terms of what we can say about that particular contract. It's - I guess, what I will say is it's still - it's over piece of all of the work that we keep talking about where we're bringing leading-edge technology into existing mission sets, programs of that size ramp slowly. I think the message I would likely to take away is the growth that we're seeing is broad-based. That's obviously a defense contract. And as you can see, both civil and security also posted very strong growth. So we're seeing strong demand across really, I can't say it's every single part of our business, but lots of aspects of our business. And the team is doing a great job of hiring against our demand, bringing in the right people, with the right clearances and the right technical expertise, so that we can ramp up and continue the momentum. Thanks, Louie. Hi, Cai, good morning. I think, generally speaking, this is what I can tell you. I think the contract that you're describing, I mentioned briefly last call and Matt talked about it in the prepared remarks, it relates to our cyber work in the Intel market and has overlap with some of our existing contract. The award was pulled back and it's been re-evaluated. So it's not technically under protest. And so we - as you know, because you've followed us for a very long time, we generally don't comment on specific procurements, while they're under evaluation. Here's what I can tell you about the processing well, about this dynamic in particular and then the broader environment. The - as you know, we're not demand constrained. We have $30 billion in backlog. And even with our record hiring, we're still having filled every rec. And the place where it's hardest for us to recruit is in clear technical staff for work in the intelligence community. And so we still have a lot of open recs there and now a significant volume of open recs had EverWatch. So our goal ultimately in this area is to retain and grow that workforce and deploy it against the work that is in front of us, I think we're doing well there. There's more work to do because, ultimately, we want to continue to grow that workforce as the way which we grow the Intel business overall. And then the last point I would make on the protest environment overall, that continues to be a slow process. We have a number of things that have slid to the right as a result of that. I think that we are very optimistic about the awards picture in the near term, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And we're feeling good about the overall demand picture and the momentum that we have. Yes, to the extent that the contracting workforce in the government has been constrained for a long time, and they've been under pressure for a long time. Again, you and I have been on these calls for a while, I mean there was a time where, for example, the department wanted to re-compete things more often. And so that increased the workforce or the workload on the contracting shops significantly without a corresponding increase on the headcount that needed to address that from the government side. And that's been a perennial issue. I don't know that it is any worse now than it's been in the past. Again, ultimately, from our perspective, the - I'm sorry, I'm saying it again, but the demand picture right now feels very strong. Thank you. I had the pleasure of spending time with our team in Europe late last year and just be inspired and amazed by the work that they're doing in support of our government as our government supports Ukraine. And so we're well deployed in the middle of that mission, helping drive intelligence, helping drive analysis and doing really good work. So overall, that - sort of that's our posture. It's a posture that is longstanding. It's a longstanding team that has pivoted to this mission. There's obviously been some growth on the team as a result of additional mission needs. I would expect that to continue. But I don't see that as a meaningful driver of growth as much as I see it as a real demonstration of the great work that we got on people can do as we bring technology to the mission needs. Thank you. It's really hard to predict that what will happen sort of second and third order effects of the debt ceiling debate. It's even hard to understand what the first order effects will be. I will say this. I mean, obviously, a protracted fight on that in our view is not good for the country, and it's certainly not good for our clients and by extension is not great for us. I think part of our approach to all of this is - and this is why - is to build momentum to drive the business that's in front of us, to grow organically, to have the right people doing the right work at the center of these missions, which tends to be more resilient to overall sort of external uncertainty. That's what we have done in the past. That's what we are doing now. And that's what gives us confidence that despite the fact that there's that issue, there's next year's government budget and all of that, which are things that we are watching very closely. Ultimately, we are on track and remain on track to deliver our investment thesis to advance VoLT and to be the kind of partner to our clients that they need us to be right now. You know, from my perspective - well, first of all, as you see, we have strong growth across the board right now. And the type of work that we are doing under VoLT, the work we're positioned to do, again, around bringing AI, cyber, digital transformation into existing missions, into expanded mission scopes around space, around INDOPACOM in China around some of the key issues, which at some level are some of the few bipartisans remaining give us confidence that we are doing the right work and in the right place. And at least for the immediate future, the increases in head count and the speed at which our headcount is - our people are getting on programs give us confidence that the business has strength. And that's our approach, and it's not limited to one small piece or another. It's where - we believe that's a broad-based view. Good morning. At this point, I think it's a little premature to try and speculate what the budget picture will look like next year and how it might play out. I think as just Matt pointed out, we and the industry have become very adept at managing through this budget turbulence. We - and I think that's ultimately what we are focused on, I think when we get closer, if we know more and there's more clarity, we'll be happy to engage at that time. The one thing I can tell you is our business right now is doing well, their strength on the demand side, their strength in the supply side, their strength on the balance sheet. And all of that strength put together give us confidence that within reason, we can - we're preparing well to weather a storm and deliver on our investment thesis commitments through FY '25. Thank you. Thank you, and thank you all for joining us this morning. As we come to a close on this call, let me first recognize that we have a new member of our Board of Directors. As we announced last week, Rory Read has joined the Booz Allen Board. Rory is Senior Vice President at Ericsson and the President and CEO of Vonage, which is Ericsson's global telecommunication platform. I'm really excited to have Rory on our Board and I'm already seeing how we benefit from his expertise, both as a technologist and as a business leader. And then lastly, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and recognize and thank the amazing people of Booz Allen. For sure, for their hard work and dedication because it's their hard work and dedication that delivers the exceptional results, we were able to discuss with you today. And also for their generosity and what they do for the communities in which they live and work. And specifically, through our year-end giving campaign, our employees contributed more than $1 million think about that word, more than $1 million to the causes that they are most passionate about. And because of the firm's match, we ultimately gave over $2 million to more than 2,000 non-profit organizations, and this is the highest impact we have ever made through year-end campaign. Our people's commitment and service to our communities, to our clients, to each other, they're the core of who we are. They are the core of our purpose and our values. So I come to work every day, it is really my colleagues that inspire me. So I just want to say, once again, thank you. Thank you, Booz Allen. And on that note, thanks again to all of you for joining us, and have a great day."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. As Horacio noted, we are extremely pleased with our financial results, both for the third quarter and for our fiscal year-to-date. We remain the industry's organic growth leader and continue to operate the business very well. We have built excellent momentum toward reaching our fiscal year and investment thesis objectives, and we expect this momentum to continue given our strategic positioning, our strong execution and a positive budget environment through the end of the government fiscal year. Before discussing our third quarter results in detail, I will highlight a few key areas of our fiscal year-to-date performance. Over the first three quarters, we delivered 9.5% organic revenue growth. This is a result of us winning work aligned with our VoLT strategy and hiring, retaining and efficiently deploying the right talent. Our adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.5% in this period reflect continued strong contract level execution and prudent cost management. We deployed $714 million of capital through three quarters, a combination of dividends, share repurchases and the strategic acquisition of EverWatch. As a result, Booz Allen remains on track to achieve our investment thesis goals and to continue delivering excellent value to our shareholders. Now please turn to Slide 6, as I discuss our third quarter results in detail. At the top line, total revenue in the third quarter grew 12.1% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 11.2% to $1.6 billion. Almost all of this growth was organic, as our organic growth accelerated to 11.6% for the quarter. I am particularly pleased that our revenue growth was driven by double-digit contributions from each of our three federal markets. In Defense, revenue grew approximately 10% year-over-year led by strong performance in our Aerospace and Joint Combatant Command accounts. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 16% year-over-year, highlighted by growth in our health account, and in the mission-critical cyber and digital solutions work we perform across the civil market. In our Intelligence business, we grew by approximately 14% year-over-year, driven by our National Cyber and Defense Intelligence accounts, as well as our strong hiring across the board. At this point, we expect a stand-alone fiscal year 2024 contribution from EverWatch of between $180 million and $200 million. Our Global Commercial business, which accounted for roughly 3% of our revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 13% year-over-year. This reflects the sale of our MENA and Managed Threat Services businesses in the second and third quarters, respectively, that streamlined our commercial business and positioned it well for future growth. On the labor supply side, our client staff headcount grew to 28,269 at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 1,975 employee's year-over-year, or 7.5%. Total headcount, inclusive of corporate staff increased to 31,130, this equates to growth of 1,677 employees year-over-year, or 5.7%. These figures included over 400 employees who joined at Booz Allen from EverWatch in the third quarter, as well as the approximately 80 employees who left the firm with our MTS divestiture. The transformation of our talent acquisition life cycle and improved levels of attrition in the quarter drove this continued acceleration in headcount. These results show that we continue to attract and retain the high end talent we need, even in an extremely competitive labor market. On the demand side, net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $197 million, which translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.09 times. Our trailing 12 months book-to-bill metric remained solid at over 1.2 times. This is the best indicator of sustained demand as it normalizes for quarter-to-quarter volatility. We can attribute our relatively light book-to-bill number this quarter to two factors. First, seasonality, as this is consistent with our historical bookings pattern. And second, the timing of a few large awards and protest resolutions that were pushed into the fourth quarter. This timing dynamic includes a large contract award in our intelligence market that Horacio referenced in our last earnings call. This award, which has meaningful overlap with work we are performing today is currently under re-evaluation. In the quarter, total backlog grew to $30 billion, which is approximately 8.2% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 12.4% to $4.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 7.6% to $10.1 billion and priced options grew 7.5% to $15.4 billion. We are very comfortable that this backlog and the strength of our proposal and award pipeline support our near and medium term growth aspirations. Consistent with our strong top line performance, we generated $244 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, up 9.8% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.7%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBITDA margin reflects a mix of drivers with strong contract level performance and solid cost management, offset by a higher billable expense mix, higher unallowable spend, and the impact of wage inflation on our fixed price and time and materials contracts. Our net income decreased 76.2% year-over-year to $31 million. This was primarily a result of the $124 million legal reserve, we recorded this quarter in connection with the DOJ matter. Adjusted net income, which excludes this legal reserve was approximately $142 million, up 4% year-over-year. These were driven by our strong operating results, which were partially offset by higher tax and interest expense compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 75.8% compared to the prior year period to $0.23, primarily as a result of the aforementioned legal reserve. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the legal reserve, increased 4.9% year-over-year to $1.07. Turning now to the balance sheet. We closed the third quarter with a cash balance of $371 million, and a $1 billion untapped revolver. Free cash flow for the quarter was $117 million, the result of $139 million in cash from operating activities, net of $22 million of capital expenditures. Operating cash was supported by collections that kept pace with our revenue growth, but with seasonally light due to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses paid out in the quarter. Now turning to Slide 8. During the third quarter, we deployed $510 million of capital. This included approximately $440 million connected with the EverWatch acquisition, $11 million in share repurchases at an average price of $96.30 per share, and $57 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.5 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times. As Horacio mentioned, we were delighted by last week's news from Standard & Poor's, who upgraded us to BBB minus and investment-grade credit rating. We look forward to the enhanced flexibility and access to capital markets that this upgrade will provide, and we will continue to be good stewards of our balance sheet, while deploying capital in a patient and disciplined manner. To this end, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a $0.04 increase to our quarterly dividend. This dividend of $0.47 per share will be payable on March 1st to stockholders of record as of February 10. Finally, let me summarize our updated guidance for full fiscal year 2023. Please turn now to Slide 9. Our excellent performance and sustained momentum through the first three quarters give us confidence in our ability to finish this fiscal year strong. At the top line, we are increasing our guidance for full fiscal year revenue growth to between 9.5% and 10.5%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has one fewer working day when compared to the prior fiscal year, which impacts year-over-year quarterly growth comparisons. We still expect margins to be in the range of high 10% to low 11%. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $995 million and $1.15 billion in sync with the increase in our top line guidance. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of between $4.35 and $4.50 per share. We now expect capital expenditures to be between $80 million to $90 million for the fiscal year. And lastly, our fiscal year 2023 operating cash flow guidance remains unchanged from last quarter. In closing, like Horacio, I really want to thank our dedicated employees, whose relentless focus on the mission is really the root of our outstanding performance. Because of them, Booz Allen remains on track to achieve our investment thesis goals and to continue to deliver excellent shareholder value. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Good morning, Louie. Thanks, Louie. Never say never. But I think right now, we're more focused on small to mid sized tuck-ins that are strategic accelerants. We're really pleased with our capital deployment to date, deployed $510 million in the quarter, including EverWatch. And as Horacio said, they've got some short-term hurdles they need to overcome on the supply side. But from a demand perspective and in terms of long-term strategic value, we really see it as an opportunity for us to transform portions of our intelligence business. So we're working it. We've got a pipeline. As you know, the M&A market has been and relatively slow in the past couple of quarters for a handful of macroeconomic reasons. But we're going to play the game that's in front of us. And the strength of our balance sheet just gives us a lot of flexibility to do that. No, nothing meaningful. I think the top line message is we have the backlog and the award and proposal pipeline we need to meet our near and medium-term growth aspirations. And even more important, the capabilities and solutions we're building in line with our VoLT strategy are really resonating with our clients. So we said it both in stronger quarters like Q2 and lighter quarters like this one that we want to focus - we focus on last 12 months book-to-bill. And if you look back at where we were at the end of Q3, the prior fiscal \u2013 three fiscal years, that was between, let's say, 1.15 and 1.3 and right now, we're at 1.22. So we're right in line with where we want to be and Q4 is shaping up well. And the industry has a lot of experience, unfortunately, with budgetary uncertainty. We have it. Others in the industry have it. And as Horacio said, we've told the team is play the game in front of us. And the best thing we can do is to prepare for uncertainty is to build as strong a business as possible. And we feel like we're well positioned strategically through Volt, as Horacio mentioned, and our client positioning operationally. We're running the business very, very well. I think more disciplined than we've ever run it. And financially, given the strength of our performance and the quality of our balance sheet. And we sort of glossed over it because there's a lot of news in the quarter, but I think us being upgraded to investment grade is a reflection of that. Happy to. Our cash performance year-to-date has been solid. Again, that's why we reiterated guidance. Thankfully, we took a conservative approach and didn't assume 174 would be repealed. So we anticipate, and you see that in the bridge we provide an - we provided in the presentation initially 174 being about 170 - about $140 million this year, and we have $175 million of other cash taxes. So to get to the bridge that you described, we're obviously growing, and collections are keeping pace with growth in Q3. Outlays were also up, including a couple of things that were temporal. So we feel like we've got the ability to generate cash and invest in the business and hit our targets in the guidance."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release that we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. With me today to talk about our business and the financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking and may relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our filings with the SEC and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future results or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings release and slides. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before diving into the financial results this morning, I would like to begin by acknowledging the seamless transition of our Chief Financial Officer role, from Lloyd Howell to Matt Calderone, two outstanding professionals with great track records at Booz Allen. As we announced last month, Lloyd Howell is retiring on December 31. I am grateful for Lloyd's tremendous contributions over his 34 year career with Booz Allen and especially, his last six years as CFO. Lloyd greatly advanced our relationship with the investor community. Under his leadership, Booz Allen learned to define and communicate long term investment parameters and articulate our position as an organic growth leader. I will miss Lloyd's voice in our internal discussions and these earnings calls. And I know he will go on to do amazing things in the future. Our new CFO, Matt Calderone stepped into the role on October 1. Matt has been with Booz Allen for 20 years and has an exceptional record of driving success for our firm. He began his career at Booz Allen in our old commercial business, the same business where I began. And then transitioned to serve intelligence clients. He joined my direct team in the early days of Vision 2020 and was the driving force in making that strategy a reality. Matt went on to launch our corporate development function and in 2017 partnered with Lloyd to lead strategic finance and transform our forecasting planning and analysis function. Most recently, Matt served as our Chief Strategy Officer. All those experiences have prepared Matt to step into the CFO role and continue to drive our firm\u2019s success. I am personally fortunate to have a leader of Matt's caliber and experience as our CFO. Matt, it is my pleasure to have you join us on these earnings calls. Let's turn now to business performance. Matt and I are very excited to share excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. During this quarter, we continued our strong revenue and EBITDA growth and accelerated both our hiring and business capture. When we began the fiscal year, we shared with you our plan to build momentum in the first half to mitigate potential for increased volatility in the second half. We also shared our view that VoLT, our growth strategy centered on velocity, leadership and technology, it's not only our future but also our present. This means that we need to move rapidly to implement our strategy in order to meet our multi-year goal of growing adjusted EBITDA from $935 million last fiscal year to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. The headline for today is this; halfway through the fiscal year, we believe we are operationally and strategically on track to deliver on our multiyear goals. And in fact, we expect to deliver above planned financial results in fiscal year 2023. Therefore, we are pleased to raise our guidance for this fiscal year. We now expect our revenue growth range to be 8% to 10% and adjusted EBITDA range to be $975 million to $1.015 billion. Matt will cover the numbers and guidance in detail. But first, I would like to take some time to frame these results as part of our larger business journey. I will first discuss how our FY \u201823 operational priorities impact this fiscal year financials. Then, I'll cover the broader progress we are making on VoLT, with a specific focus today on the technology dimension. As you can see, the numbers for our second quarter of fiscal year 2023 speak for themselves. While uncertainty from inflation, recessionary fears, geopolitical conflict and ongoing budget debates remain, we have generated great momentum, which is reflected in the progress we are making against the operational priorities outlined in our May earnings call. Let me take a moment to summarize that progress. First, our top operational priority continues to be hiring. Client staff headcount has grown 4.2% over the past 12 months in a very competitive labor market. And we are seeing historically strong absorption of new hires into billable programs. These concurrent improvements are the result of transformative work by our recruiting and business teams under the leadership of our COO, Kristine Martin Anderson. Today, I am also excited to share that we have crossed the milestone of 30,000 Booz Allen employees. Our second priority is to continue to win high quality work at the intersection of key missions and new technology. Our leaders delivered an outstanding quarter of contract awards, resulting in record backlog and a 12 month book-to-bill of 1.32 times. Third, our leaders are managing the business extraordinarily well and delivering on the bottom line. We're effectively managing costs in an inflationary environment. As evidenced, for example, by the significant difference in client staff headcount growth versus total headcount growth. This provides resiliency and enables investment, which is key to fueling future growth. And fourth, we must deploy capital in a way that creates maximum value for our stakeholders and drives our strategy forward. As we announced earlier this month, we are pleased to have closed on the acquisition of EverWatch. We're excited about the opportunities EverWatch creates to accelerate our National Cyber business. Building on this strong operational backdrop, we're also making significant progress in implementing VoLT. In the next few moments, I hope to illustrate, how our innovation agenda and differentiated technology solutions uniquely position us to accelerate growth and contribute to achieving our multiyear investment thesis goals. Our clients live in an increasingly complex environment, pressured by geopolitical instability, global challenges for pandemics to climate change and the increased need to invest in new technology, while at the same time sustaining legacy programs, all in a fraught political and economic environment. We believe we are uniquely positioned to use innovation to simultaneously help our clients navigate these complex challenges and drive our own financial performance. Our basic premise is that technology cycles come in waves that are growing in both amplitude and frequency. Booz Allen's approach to innovation centers on helping our clients translate new technologies into mission success beyond the prototype to full scalability. We believe this requires three things. One, extensive knowledge of the mission and its requirements. Two, insights and access to new technologies early in their lifecycle. And three, an integrated talent base that can quickly scale to provide solutions and services. An excellent example of our innovation approach is our support for the Department of Veterans Affairs, where Booz Allen plays an integral role in supporting their digital transformation. Over the past decade, we have invested to grow our technical talent, deepen our mission expertise and build solutions to help the VA modernize, leveraging capabilities like low code, no code, AI, DevOps, Agile and cloud. Through acquisitions, we have continued to gain even greater scale and acceleration. Following this approach to innovating at the mission technology intersection, our VA business is over 6 times larger today than it was 10 years ago. More broadly, VoLT has challenged us to reimagine our innovation agenda as part of a comprehensive Chief Technology Office. The role of the CTO is to continuously evolve our scale technology positions and anticipate the next waves. Our ongoing investments in key emerging technologies are already building momentum. For example, we are integrating cyber and AI in our cyber pre-coke (ph) platform for the Threat Hunter (ph) at the tactical edge. We are anticipating the implications of post quantum encryption. And we are developing 5G prototypes that provide dynamic spectrum sharing through an AI sensing application. Returning for a moment to the VA example. Our investments in emerging technology are central to their next set of mission requirements. For example, we are developing digital twin solutions to innovate the planning and design of hybrid operating rooms using AI power design and clinical workflow simulations. All of this is only by the small sampling of how our innovation agenda is positioning us for future growth. These next generation solutions and many more are becoming real today. We're excited to begin showcasing them more broadly, when the Helix, a reimagined center for innovation opens mid-November. We hope you will visit the physical or virtual versions of the Helix later this year. A closing thought, our investment in organic growth, our strong balance sheet, our evolving operating model and above all, our exceptional team give me confidence that we are on track to accomplish the ambitious strategic and financial objectives outlined in VoLT and our investment thesis. I am bullish about the future of Booz Allen. And with that, Matt, welcome to the earnings call. Over to you to take us through the financial results in-depth.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today. First, I want to echo Horacio's sentiments. Lloyd did an outstanding job as CFO. He built a world class team and developed a financial strategy that continues to generate durable value for all of our stakeholders. And on a personal note, Lloyd has been a true friend and a great mentor to me. I'm excited for the opportunity to lead our finance team, to work with Booz Allen's outstanding group of leaders to deliver results and to engage with you along the way. As you know, we said that we wanted to come out of the gates with a strong first half this fiscal year and we did exactly that. These exceptional results position us to exceed our original plan for this fiscal year, even while ramping up strategic investment in the back half of the year to fuel ongoing organic growth. And as Horacio noted, our results put us on track to meet our multiyear investment thesis objectives. Now please turn to Slide 6, as I discuss our fiscal year 2023 second quarter results. I will start by hitting the highlights of our performance. At the top line, revenue grew 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting growth across all of our markets and particularly strong performance in our Civil business. We generated $286 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, a 6% improvement over the prior year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%. This translated to $1.34 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. And lastly, we deployed $87 million in capital in the quarter exclusive of the EverWatch acquisition, which closed after quarter end. I will now cover the details of our second quarter performance in greater depth. As previously mentioned, for the second quarter, our revenue grew 9.2% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 10.1% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. These results reflect another exceptional quarter of organic revenue growth driven by the ongoing strategic repositioning of our business, strong demand for our solutions, headcount growth and higher staff utilization compared to the prior year's quarter. Our top line performance was supported by revenue growth across all of our markets. In defense, revenue grew approximately 2% year-over-year in part due to lighter billable expenses. That said, in defense, we saw strong hiring throughout the quarter and a number of meaningful wins that we expect will provide good momentum for the back half of our fiscal year and beyond. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 18% year-over-year, highlighted by particularly strong results in our health account. Our civil performance reflects the power of two pillars of our VoLT strategy, building strategic positions at the intersection of mission and technology, and using targeted acquisitions to accelerate our technical capabilities and organic growth. Our Intelligence business grew by approximately 9% year-over-year. Building on this team's hiring and portfolio shaping efforts, of the past year. And finally, in Global Commercial, revenue grew by approximately 25% year-over-year. In the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our commercial business in MENA, which was a solid but non-core asset. I'm pleased that we found a good home for our clients and employees in the region. Now please turn to Slide 7 for details on our demand signals. Net bookings for the quarter were approximately $5.5 billion, which translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 2.4 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.32 times. Total backlog grew approximately 9.8% year-over-year, resulting in our largest ever backlog of $31.8 billion. We saw growth in all three portions of our backlog. Funded backlog grew 11.3% to $5.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 8.9% to $10.4 billion and price options grew 9.8% to $16 billion. These outstanding results once again demonstrate that we are not demand constrained. We continue to win the right type of work to meet both our financial and our strategic aspirations. Pivoting now to headcount, we had an increase of approximately 800 client-serving employees in the second quarter, even after taking into account the roughly 100 employees that exited with our MENA divestiture. This performance was outstanding, particularly in light of what remains a tight labor market. Our client serving headcount is now up approximately 1,100 employees or 4.2% year-over-year. This sets us up very well to continue our top line momentum in the near term. As I mentioned earlier, at the bottom line, we generated $286 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which is up 6% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%, which is down 40 basis points year-over-year, but slightly ahead of our expectations. Our margins continue to benefit from strong contract level execution, a slight mix shift towards higher fee generating work and our ongoing strategic cost management efforts. Based on our strong operating performance and the gain from the sale of our MENA business, partially offset by higher interest expense, net income increased 10.3% year-over-year to $171 million. Adjusted net income was $178 million, up 4.5% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased 12.3% to $1.28 from $1.14 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.3% to $1.34 from $1.26. Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the second quarter with a cash balance of $757 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver. In September, we closed on the ninth amendment to our credit agreement. This allows us to continue to optimize our capital stack, including increasing the weighted average maturity of our debt. Free cash flow for the quarter was $257 million, the result of cash generated from operating activities of $273 million, less $16 million of capital expenditures. Turning now to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we returned $87 million of capital to shareholders through $30 million of share repurchases and $57 million in quarterly cash dividends. Net debt at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.1 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.1 times EBITDA. As previously mentioned, after quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of EverWatch. This acquisition is a prime example of a strategic accelerator that will allow us to bring technical and business model innovation to our clients. We are thrilled to welcome the EverWatch team aboard. Our intelligence market team is eager to work with them to expand our deep pipeline of opportunities and to better serve critical national security missions. We anticipate that this transaction will be accretive this fiscal year. Finally, today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 15. I will now address our revised guidance for the full fiscal year 2023. Please turn to Slide 9. At the top line, we are increasing guidance for revenue growth to be between 8% and 10%, which includes inorganic growth of between 1% and 2%. This is due to our strong first half performance, as well as the hiring and bookings momentum that our team has built. We anticipate that revenue growth will moderate slightly in the second half as compared to last fiscal year, which included a seasonally high billable expense mix. We are very pleased with the underlying momentum in our business. Similarly, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $975 million to $1.015 billion. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook which we now anticipate will be in the high 10% to low 11% range. These increases are based on our revenue outlook, typical seasonal spending and margin patterns and our intent to invest more heavily in the back half of the fiscal year to drive sustainable organic growth. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.50. This increase in ADEPS guidance is driven by our strong operating results, partially offset by a modest increase in interest expense. We still expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. Finally, as shown on Slide 10, due to the expected increase in profitability, we now expect our operating cash flow, excluding taxes to be between $875 million and $950 million. Earlier this month, we received a partial tax refund for our prior strategic tax planning initiatives. As a result, our expectation for net cash taxes to be paid this fiscal year has decreased to $315 million, including both a normalized tax rate and the impact of Section 174. This brings our anticipated operating cash flow inclusive of taxes to between $560 million and $635 million for the full fiscal year. In closing, let me echo Horacio again and say how proud I am of our strong performance during the second quarter. This performance was only made possible by the hard work and dedication of our now 30,000 employees. As a result, we remain on target to execute against our strategic and financial objectives, allowing Booz Allen to continue to create superior shareholder value. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gavin Parsons with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGavin Parsons: Hey. Good morning. And Matt, congrats on the new role.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Gavin.\nGavin Parsons: You talked about uncertainties into the second half of the year, we're a little ways into a continuing resolution right now. It seems like last year, that CR was particularly disruptive. Can you talk a little bit about what the environment looks like today and if you have any improved visibility, kind of relative to first half -- sorry, first quarter?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we feel great about the results in our second quarter and the entire first half. It's consistent with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year of trying to build momentum in the first half in anticipation of potential volatility in the second half. And we continue to look closely at some of those factors. We're 11 days away from an election. There's -- as you pointed out, we're under CR. We're very mindful of all of that and that's built into our guidance. But as you saw our guidance, we are, at this point, expecting a strong first -- second half and a strong full year. If I get underneath that, demand for the work that we do is very strong, and you see that in our numbers. Our talent base is growing nicely and accelerating this milestone of 30,000 Booz Allen people. I've been here a long time, it would have been unbelievable to me a few years ago, but we're here and the quality of the talent is exceptional. We are well positioned. If I could capture the way we look at the future is we have strong organic growth momentum really across all elements of our business. We're investing in the things we said we will invest under VoLT to see growth beyond what's the near-term horizon. And we're on track to deliver against our investment thesis, which is the commitment we made to all of you. So as I said, we understand the volatility in the environment that we're playing close attention. But right now, we feel very good.\nGavin Parsons: Okay. Great. And then in terms of our investment in new technologies and innovation a couple of years ago, conversation I think focus a lot more around some of these call option initiative investments. And I think today, it's evolved a little bit more towards the new technologies conversation, which you gave a lot of detail on. So can you talk a little bit just about how that strategy has evolved?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. When we were working through what we called option value as part of a set of initiatives for the last four or five years, we really learned a lot about our ability to both create technology and integrate partner technology into solutions, and we saw really some strong progress. Rec.gov is a program we've talked about over the years, Rec.gov is doing great and frankly, exceeding our expectations. And like that, we see other upside. What I think we learned as part of VoLT is that the best place for us to innovate is at the mission technology intersection, working in the places where we have strong mission presence, driving really new technology into that. I was at AUSA. A couple of weeks ago, I know a number of people on this call. When there I was talking to clients, and I was watching clients in particular react to some of the things that we're doing around AI and 5G to bring information to the edge in potentially challenging environments. And I tell you the level of excitement there gave me a lot of optimism that we're on the right track. And so when you look at our investments in health and DVA that were in our prepared remarks, when you look at our digital battlespace investments, National Cyber and the like, we think that that's the right path of evolution is to take everything we learned over the last few years and really pour it into these key mission technology intersections that are prime for hyper growth. moment.\nGavin Parsons: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment. We have a question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning and welcome Matt, and thank you Horacio for those comments.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Sheila.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So maybe if I could just ask about EverWatch, you've completed it in the quarter, so that's great. As you think about your continued M&A strategy and how it drives into your long-term growth, can you maybe discuss how you're thinking about that? You also mentioned the success you're having at Health & Liberty. So if you could just elaborate on how you're thinking about the M&A strategy given the change in CFO. Thank you.\nMatt Calderone: Thanks, Sheila. The sort of answer to your question is, no change in strategy. We still view M&A as an accelerant. I think Liberty is a great example of how M&A cannot just catalyze organic growth over time, but brining new capabilities into the fold, as Horacio just discussed. And we see ever watch very much in the same vein. We're really excited to get the team on board after seven months between signing clues, which is something quite frankly, none of us anticipated and early returns are positive. Our team and their team are working together to think through how we can take their technical and business model innovation and combine it with us, ours to bring greater value to clients, and that's going to accelerate organic growth. So we have a strong pipeline. We'd love to follow that playbook, but we're going to remain patient and disciplined.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Louie Dipalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie Dipalma: Good morning, Horacio, Lloyd, Matt, Nathan and Megan. And congrats to Matt and Lloyd.\nMatt Calderone: Thanks, Louie.\nLouie Dipalma: For Horacio, how do you view the opportunity to more aggressively pursue cybersecurity consulting for local and state government agencies? There seems to have been trillions of dollars of scheduled government stimulus, part of which is dedicated to protecting critical infrastructure and you established the CyberSaint partnership. Do you view local and state government as an underpenetrated market for you?\nHoracio Rozanski: Louie, we go back to the question of state and local every few years. The fact of the matter is Booz Allen does not have a ton of expertise in state and local channels. Our Tracepoint team does a fair amount of work there, and we'll continue that. We're not seeing sort of going into that type of wide space as a major opportunity. Right now, what we see as the major opportunities are to really double down on this mission technology intersections where we have clear presence, clear mission understanding we're bringing in new technology. And then the key point that I think is getting missed in a lot of the conversations is, we can scale. Louie, I don't know if you have the chance to spend time at AUSA, but you see a ton of prototypes. But prototype to mission impact is a very long, challenging road. And that's where I think we, as Booz Allen, are doubling down is the ability to not just bring these technologies and show a client what the technology can become. It's actually to make that technology real. And so while there are opportunities in state and local, there's probably opportunities internationally and a number of other places, and we're not oblivious to all of that. Right now, what we're focused is in creating hypergrowth in some designated mission technology intersections.\nLouie Dipalma: Great. And you guys demonstrated robust hiring during the quarter. Is that sustainable for the second half of the year? How much seasonality is there for your headcount additions?\nHoracio Rozanski: So there's always seasonality. And Q2 is always a strong quarter for us. I think this Q2 was particularly strong because sometimes those numbers include both our summer interns and sort of college hires. And the bulk of the hiring in this quarter was actually experienced talent. So I think that speaks to the robustness of our talent pipeline and our value proposition with these really critical resources that are so important to our business. Let me give you an example. I mean we always talk about the fact that we're not demand constrained. So we have a significant intelligence contract that is probably scheduled to end next fall. I think, in the September timeframe. And as we look at that, at least some of the work may move to other vehicles, vehicles that we don't hold. But we have so much demand for the talent that is doing that work now for these exquisite classified technical talent that we have opportunities to fill other open reqs across a number of other vehicles in Intel and beyond. And that is really the core of the realm is being able to deploy unique talent to do this work. That's what's actually driving our growth. I mean at this point, the rate limiting step to growth is in Intel, for example, is clear talent, not vehicle availability, which I know we talk -- everybody talks a lot about. And so we're feeling good. We're feeling like the changes that we've made to our recurring process and to our employee value proposition are sustainable. It's still a challenging talent market out there quarter-to-quarter. The numbers will fluctuate, but I think we're on the right track.\nLouie Dipalma: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Hey. Good morning, and I\u2019ll echo my congratulations to both Matt and Lloyd.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you.\nBert Subin: Thanks for the time. So previously, you highlight expectation for some medium-term margin pressure, which seems to be expected to materialize over the next one to two years, that, however, it doesn't really seem to be impacting your business this year with the raised margin guidance. Can you just talk about what the primary tailwinds and headwinds to margins are from here?\nMatt Calderone: Absolutely. I think margins are driven by a couple of factors. One is the mix of our business. So our civil business tends to be a little higher margin than security in Intel. And that's highly correlated, obviously, to contract type. That's where more of our fixed price work exists. Second factor is billable expenses, which in general, we call empty calories, but they do impact EBITDA margin, if not EBITDA itself. And then third is cost management, and we're doing really well on that front, both on the unallowable side and within the rates.\nBert Subin: Okay. In terms of\u2026 I\u2019m sorry go ahead.\nMatt Calderone: But in the short run, we don't really manage our business based on margin. There's a reason we chose EBITDA dollars from an investment thesis perspective, and we think we're really on track there. We're happy with the 6% EBITDA dollar growth that we're demonstrating year-over-year. So margins are important, obviously, but that's not the primary objective.\nBert Subin: Yeah. No, I guess I was mentioning it seems like maybe you're outperforming there a little bit, I guess, relative to what the expectations were that were set out.\nMatt Calderone: Maybe -- we're doing slightly better than we thought this year. And that obviously, that's reflected in our guidance.\nBert Subin: And then Matt, just to follow-up to a comment there on civil performance that it was really strong during the quarter. I think there was an expectation, at least coming into this quarter that DoD intel would be really strong. And I think you saw that on the intel side. As we start to look forward, do you think the sort of the setup is similar where health and some of the things you're doing on the civil side continue to drive outperformance there, at least from a sales growth perspective.\nMatt Calderone: Yes and no. I think are we going to see 18%, 20% growth in Civil year-over-year. Probably not, that will come down a bit. We're still working off some of the Liberty accelerant factor, even though it's not in -- it's not in organic growth numbers, but we're still seeing some of the near-term synergies there. But on defense, although, it showed growth in the 2% range, if you pull back, that really was driven by some year-over-year comps from a billable expense perspective, underlying, it's much stronger. So I do think you're going to see a little bit of a normalization across the three markets, but we're very excited with the ongoing performance of Civil and our Health business as well.\nHoracio Rozanski: And let me build on that, sort of the market strategic level. If you look at -- we're well aligned to the administration's domestic agenda strong investment in public health, where we have a tremendous business and a lot of upside. The modernization of the IRS, where we have a long-standing presence and a lot of opportunity, and increasingly, we're focusing on climate and how we can bring technology and AI and those kinds of things to the climate question. But then when you shift over to the National Security side, the national security strategy was just released, and it speaks to this as the defining decade. The National Defense strategy just came out and once again speaks to China as the patient competitor for the U.S. and the need to invest in technology in order to stay ahead of that competition. And all of that, I think Booz Allen is -- really has a unique position that we built over the last decade at the intersection of mission and technology where we are bringing these very new technologies, sometimes do all use technologies between commercial and government in a way that they're scalable into these massive challenges. And so as Matt said, I think the numbers are over time going to reflect the fact that we're well positioned and have strength across all of our markets.\nBert Subin: Thanks, Horacio and congratulations.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much and welcome, Matt. So could book-to-bill -- my understanding is that you had 2 billion in outstanding bids that were expected to be decided in the last week of September. Did those bids get decided? Were they in your favor? And if not, what are we looking for in terms of bookings potential in the first quarter?\nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, I'm not sure exactly which procurements you're talking about. There are some things that we want that are under protest. So I don't know the specific answer to your question. What I will say is this, a 2.4 very robust book-to-bill quarter that is both a number of significant billion dollar plus task orders and our traditional second quarter strength around tactical sales also returning, which then puts the 12 month book-to-bill in a really good place and puts backlog at record numbers. So at the risk of sounding like a broken record, we really are not demand constrained. The real opportunity for us is to continue to onboard the right talent in order to make sure that we actualize all that demand into revenue.\nCai von Rumohr: Great. And second one, if we look at EverWatch, I assume the change in organic growth is that you -- going from one to one to two is that you added both the divested -- took out the numbers for MENA, which are divested and you added in the numbers for EverWatch. A, is that correct? And B, could you give us some more color on EverWatch in terms of how much you expect add to revenues and earnings?\nMatt Calderone: That is correct, Cai. We're going to hold on giving specific numbers for EverWatch probably until next quarter. As I mentioned, it just closed two weeks ago. The teams are going through original synergy projections in business case. So we built in the overall numbers. But we'll get back to you on that next quarter.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRocco Barbero: Good morning. This is Rocco on for Seth.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nRocco Barbero: How does the current rate environment affect your thought process around levers versus one year ago at the Investor Day?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'm not sure. The question broke up a little bit. I mean do you mind repeating it?\nRocco Barbero: Yes. How does the current rate environment affect your thought process about leverage versus one year ago at the Investor Day?\nHoracio Rozanski: I got you. I heard burn rate environment, I was not sure it was current rate. Okay, so you're talking about interest rates. We're -- as Matt said, when we were discussing M&A, our capital deployment strategy for the moment remains unchanged. We are looking for strategic accelerators that will actually allow us to accomplish VoLT our investment thesis and accelerate organic growth. We have some good examples of that in the past. We hope EverWatch will be another great example of that as we look forward. When we make an acquisition, we look at three things. In sequence, number one, the opportunity to drive organic growth in the long term. Number two, the cultural fit and the connection to our people. And then number three, the numbers have to make sense. And obviously, with rising rates that raises that bar. But honestly, most of the deals that we look at and pass on never make it to that third question. It's the first two where we say, no, this is not for us.\nRocco Barbero: Thanks. Then as a quick follow-up, defense growth has been a bit more muted than the other end markets. What might sort of shake that loose?\nHoracio Rozanski: So I'll start, I'm sure Matt will want to add. Actually, defense had a good quarter. It's actually a little bit masked by the fact that our billable expenses in that business were lighter than they've been, lighter than we expected. But as we always say, we think about billable expenses as calories because they carry very little profit margin and very little EBITDA. So if you look underneath that, the revenues produced by our talent, we see real acceleration there. And as Matt pointed out, with new people coming in over the last quarter strongly and good billability for new hires, we think there's organic growth momentum there as there is in the other sectors.\nMatt Calderone: That's right, Horacio. We won some really high-quality work in defense. So I would say it has been shaken loose. As Horacio had mentioned, it was a little masked this quarter by some year-over-year billable expense comps. But you'll see over the back half of the year that there's strong momentum in our defense business.\nRocco Barbero: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Good morning and welcome Matt.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you.\nRobert Spingarn: A couple of just quick things. Back to M&A for a minute and interest rates, with the higher rates, has private equity sort of backed out of the market a little bit? We've been hearing that. So less competition from them for M&A.?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'm going to let Matt take that.\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. I would say that private equity is backed out, particularly in the mid-tier in our market, not just buyers, but a lot of the sellers are private equity backed. I would describe this as a much more cautious market. Certainly, transaction volume has decreased given all the uncertainty we know from macro factors to interest rates, as Horacio mentioned, the regulatory environment. And what I think you're seeing is that there are fewer large auction processes, and it's a world where relationships and reputation matter. And we really think that plays to our strengths. If you look at how we did Liberty, Tracepoint, EverWatch, they're all outside of processes, they were targets that we identified that we thought met the criteria Horacio outlined. And we really took the time to get to know them and make sure it was the right fit, not just for us but for them. So I think you're going to see more of that. I'm seeing more of that personally, having a different set of relationships with not just strategics, but a lot of private equity buyers and sellers. So no, I wouldn't say the private equity firms are out of the market. That hasn't been our experience.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then just switching gears a little bit, go back to the head count increases. We talked about it earlier, you're up, I don't know, 2%, 3% or so year-to-date in headcount depending on how you measure it. Your top line growth is more than double that even on an organic basis. I wanted to talk a little bit about that dynamic, Horacio. And does it reflect in any way the fact that the incremental headcount is just producing more revenues? Is that part of it? Is this a higher mix increase?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think there's a couple of drivers here. The one key driver is, if you look at the difference between total headcount and client staff headcount, client staff head count is up 4.2%. And -- we've been -- as Matt pointed out, we've been managing costs to make sure that in an inflationary environment, we can manage our rates. We are being prudent, and we create room to continue the investments we need to do under VoLT to secure future growth. About 4.2% client staff growth is really good, and especially in a market like this one. And it's the kind of growth that over time is always sort of sustained our above market growth. The second dynamic, which I talked a little bit about on the key -- on the prepared remarks, is that one of the things Kristine has really has all of us focused on is not just on hiring, but on the process of going from hiring to somebody getting fully billable, which is a process that, frankly, used to take too long at Booz Allen, and we're shortening that significantly. That allows us to get more revenue with a smaller bench, which drives billability, which then drives our ability to invest in talent, our ability to grow, and creates a bit of a virtuous circle here. And I think that's -- I think that's a sustainable driver in the near term as we look at the talent market evolution and what we're doing internally. And I'll finish with the -- again, I mean, 30,000 people at Booz Allen is an exciting number for us and one that speaks of the success we've had over the last few years.\nMatt Calderone: And Horacio, if I can just add. The third factor to the two you mentioned headcount growth and utilization, our wages have increased. And for the 75% of our contract base, our cost plus and T&M contracts, were for the most part we can pass those through. That's driving revenue as well. We see that every year. When salaries go up, and we're certainly seeing more of that this year than we have in the past.\nRobert Spingarn: And just on that note with hiring. Just with the tech companies like Amazon, web services and Microsoft freezing hiring, especially in the D.C. area. Does that help you get talent in the door?\nHoracio Rozanski: From my perspective, we're seeing -- it's a challenging talent environment. I know there were significant announcements about tons of hires over the last couple of years. A lot of that we did not materialize really, there's now conversation about maybe less hiring. We're not seeing that materialize. The environment is challenging. One of the things we said to ourselves under VoLT is we're probably going to have a tech talent shortage that was going to last a decade. And so we spent a lot of time rethinking and retooling our processes so that we can be successful hiring people in a constrained environment over the horizon.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. Well, it looks like that\u2019s working. Thanks so much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Colin Canfield with Barclays. Your line is open.\nColin Canfield: Hey. Good morning, and congrats Llyod and Matt. Could we just level set the EBITDA growth algorithm for us? I think the previous setup that we talked about from an organic growth perspective was mid-single digit hiring growth plus low-single digit wage inflation and then modest margin impression towards that FY '25 EBITDA target with a placeholder of roughly $150 million to $200 million of acquired EBITDA. And how do we think about that kind of versus the slower implied organic headcount growth this quarter, as well as kind of an accelerating wage inflation environment? Thanks.\nMatt Calderone: So I'll take the first part of your question first. I think that model is the one we're following. As Horacio said, we are on track for the investment thesis, not just in aggregate. But I think if you look at the piece parts of how it's playing out, organic growth, inorganic and the like, it's playing out how we expected. On the second part, I'm not sure I understood the question. With 4.2% year-over-year consulting staff headcount growth and the momentum we see in the business, that's right on track with where we want to be, and I think it's in line with the model that you articulated.\nColin Canfield: Okay. Got it. And within that construct, what sort of wage inflation should we be considered?\nMatt Calderone: So we've said that we expect wage inflation this year in the 3.5% to 4.5% range and we're within that down probably a little bit towards the higher end, which is higher than years past, but honestly not significantly higher than in years past.\nColin Canfield: Got it. And just one last question. You mentioned Mission Tech a little bit more than previous scripts. Can you just talk about how you guys are thinking about acquiring capital intensity and fixed price exposure versus kind of more headcount driven?\nHoracio Rozanski: We're really focused on mission technology intersections, and we're focused on ensuring that our clients have what they need as scalable solutions to solve their problems. Some of that is partnering with people that have amazing technologies, products and solutions. Some of that is things we're developing on our own. And a lot of that is bringing a unique talent base that can actually take something that may be on a commercial shelf or even custom bill for the government and make it real into the mission, make it adapted and make sure that across different environments. And so forth, clients can get real value. And this real value point is when you're going to hear me talk about over and over because there's always the risk that we become infatuated with some new technology, becomes a bit of a buzzword. A lot of money gets spent and no value gets created. And I think for us to continue to be the trusted player that we are in this market, our job is to ensure that we'll bring the technology forward. We help our clients really get value from that. And if you look at our numbers, not just this quarter or this half, but really the last decade, I think they speak to the fact that we've done that successfully, and that we will continue to do that. That's our focus.\nColin Canfield: Got it. Appreciate the color.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there's no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for your questions, and thank you for joining us. I hope Matt and I did a good job of conveying our excitement about the strength of this business and the progress we're making on VoLT and on the investment thesis. We feel confident about the future. I keep coming back, we're 30,000 strong now, and we all look with optimism at the opportunities that are ahead for our firm, for our clients, for our people and certainly for our investors. Let me close with a final point, a bit of an advertisement, if you don't mind. Earlier this week, we published our new thought leadership publication, and it's called Velocity. It's available on our website. And in it, you'll hear from Booz Allen and many of our experts about how emerging technologies can be applied to some of the nation's biggest challenges about the critical role and innovation ecosystem place, empowering the digital revolution, about how to win the race for technology talent and many more. So I hope you'll enjoy reading it, and it will give us feedback. And with that, again, thank you for your continued interest. And with that [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call. Before diving into the financial results this morning, I would like to begin by acknowledging the seamless transition of our Chief Financial Officer role, from Lloyd Howell to Matt Calderone, two outstanding professionals with great track records at Booz Allen. As we announced last month, Lloyd Howell is retiring on December 31. I am grateful for Lloyd's tremendous contributions over his 34 year career with Booz Allen and especially, his last six years as CFO. Lloyd greatly advanced our relationship with the investor community. Under his leadership, Booz Allen learned to define and communicate long term investment parameters and articulate our position as an organic growth leader. I will miss Lloyd's voice in our internal discussions and these earnings calls. And I know he will go on to do amazing things in the future. Our new CFO, Matt Calderone stepped into the role on October 1. Matt has been with Booz Allen for 20 years and has an exceptional record of driving success for our firm. He began his career at Booz Allen in our old commercial business, the same business where I began. And then transitioned to serve intelligence clients. He joined my direct team in the early days of Vision 2020 and was the driving force in making that strategy a reality. Matt went on to launch our corporate development function and in 2017 partnered with Lloyd to lead strategic finance and transform our forecasting planning and analysis function. Most recently, Matt served as our Chief Strategy Officer. All those experiences have prepared Matt to step into the CFO role and continue to drive our firm's success. I am personally fortunate to have a leader of Matt's caliber and experience as our CFO. Matt, it is my pleasure to have you join us on these earnings calls. Let's turn now to business performance. Matt and I are very excited to share excellent results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. During this quarter, we continued our strong revenue and EBITDA growth and accelerated both our hiring and business capture. When we began the fiscal year, we shared with you our plan to build momentum in the first half to mitigate potential for increased volatility in the second half. We also shared our view that VoLT, our growth strategy centered on velocity, leadership and technology, it's not only our future but also our present. This means that we need to move rapidly to implement our strategy in order to meet our multi-year goal of growing adjusted EBITDA from $935 million last fiscal year to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. The headline for today is this; halfway through the fiscal year, we believe we are operationally and strategically on track to deliver on our multiyear goals. And in fact, we expect to deliver above planned financial results in fiscal year 2023. Therefore, we are pleased to raise our guidance for this fiscal year. We now expect our revenue growth range to be 8% to 10% and adjusted EBITDA range to be $975 million to $1.015 billion. Matt will cover the numbers and guidance in detail. But first, I would like to take some time to frame these results as part of our larger business journey. I will first discuss how our FY \u201823 operational priorities impact this fiscal year financials. Then, I'll cover the broader progress we are making on VoLT, with a specific focus today on the technology dimension. As you can see, the numbers for our second quarter of fiscal year 2023 speak for themselves. While uncertainty from inflation, recessionary fears, geopolitical conflict and ongoing budget debates remain, we have generated great momentum, which is reflected in the progress we are making against the operational priorities outlined in our May earnings call. Let me take a moment to summarize that progress. First, our top operational priority continues to be hiring. Client staff headcount has grown 4.2% over the past 12 months in a very competitive labor market. And we are seeing historically strong absorption of new hires into billable programs. These concurrent improvements are the result of transformative work by our recruiting and business teams under the leadership of our COO, Kristine Martin Anderson. Today, I am also excited to share that we have crossed the milestone of 30,000 Booz Allen employees. Our second priority is to continue to win high quality work at the intersection of key missions and new technology. Our leaders delivered an outstanding quarter of contract awards, resulting in record backlog and a 12 month book-to-bill of 1.32 times. Third, our leaders are managing the business extraordinarily well and delivering on the bottom line. We're effectively managing costs in an inflationary environment. As evidenced, for example, by the significant difference in client staff headcount growth versus total headcount growth. This provides resiliency and enables investment, which is key to fueling future growth. And fourth, we must deploy capital in a way that creates maximum value for our stakeholders and drives our strategy forward. As we announced earlier this month, we are pleased to have closed on the acquisition of EverWatch. We're excited about the opportunities EverWatch creates to accelerate our National Cyber business. Building on this strong operational backdrop, we're also making significant progress in implementing VoLT. In the next few moments, I hope to illustrate, how our innovation agenda and differentiated technology solutions uniquely position us to accelerate growth and contribute to achieving our multiyear investment thesis goals. Our clients live in an increasingly complex environment, pressured by geopolitical instability, global challenges for pandemics to climate change and the increased need to invest in new technology, while at the same time sustaining legacy programs, all in a fraught political and economic environment. We believe we are uniquely positioned to use innovation to simultaneously help our clients navigate these complex challenges and drive our own financial performance. Our basic premise is that technology cycles come in waves that are growing in both amplitude and frequency. Booz Allen's approach to innovation centers on helping our clients translate new technologies into mission success beyond the prototype to full scalability. We believe this requires three things. One, extensive knowledge of the mission and its requirements. Two, insights and access to new technologies early in their lifecycle. And three, an integrated talent base that can quickly scale to provide solutions and services. An excellent example of our innovation approach is our support for the Department of Veterans Affairs, where Booz Allen plays an integral role in supporting their digital transformation. Over the past decade, we have invested to grow our technical talent, deepen our mission expertise and build solutions to help the VA modernize, leveraging capabilities like low code, no code, AI, DevOps, Agile and cloud. Through acquisitions, we have continued to gain even greater scale and acceleration. Following this approach to innovating at the mission technology intersection, our VA business is over 6 times larger today than it was 10 years ago. More broadly, VoLT has challenged us to reimagine our innovation agenda as part of a comprehensive Chief Technology Office. The role of the CTO is to continuously evolve our scale technology positions and anticipate the next waves. Our ongoing investments in key emerging technologies are already building momentum. For example, we are integrating cyber and AI in our cyber pre-coke (ph) platform for the Threat Hunter (ph) at the tactical edge. We are anticipating the implications of post quantum encryption. And we are developing 5G prototypes that provide dynamic spectrum sharing through an AI sensing application. Returning for a moment to the VA example. Our investments in emerging technology are central to their next set of mission requirements. For example, we are developing digital twin solutions to innovate the planning and design of hybrid operating rooms using AI power design and clinical workflow simulations. All of this is only by the small sampling of how our innovation agenda is positioning us for future growth. These next generation solutions and many more are becoming real today. We're excited to begin showcasing them more broadly, when the Helix, a reimagined center for innovation opens mid-November. We hope you will visit the physical or virtual versions of the Helix later this year. A closing thought, our investment in organic growth, our strong balance sheet, our evolving operating model and above all, our exceptional team give me confidence that we are on track to accomplish the ambitious strategic and financial objectives outlined in VoLT and our investment thesis. I am bullish about the future of Booz Allen. And with that, Matt, welcome to the earnings call. Over to you to take us through the financial results in-depth. Good morning, Gavin. Sure. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we feel great about the results in our second quarter and the entire first half. It's consistent with the plan we outlined at the beginning of the year of trying to build momentum in the first half in anticipation of potential volatility in the second half. And we continue to look closely at some of those factors. We're 11 days away from an election. There's -- as you pointed out, we're under CR. We're very mindful of all of that and that's built into our guidance. But as you saw our guidance, we are, at this point, expecting a strong first -- second half and a strong full year. If I get underneath that, demand for the work that we do is very strong, and you see that in our numbers. Our talent base is growing nicely and accelerating this milestone of 30,000 Booz Allen people. I've been here a long time, it would have been unbelievable to me a few years ago, but we're here and the quality of the talent is exceptional. We are well positioned. If I could capture the way we look at the future is we have strong organic growth momentum really across all elements of our business. We're investing in the things we said we will invest under VoLT to see growth beyond what's the near-term horizon. And we're on track to deliver against our investment thesis, which is the commitment we made to all of you. So as I said, we understand the volatility in the environment that we're playing close attention. But right now, we feel very good. Sure. When we were working through what we called option value as part of a set of initiatives for the last four or five years, we really learned a lot about our ability to both create technology and integrate partner technology into solutions, and we saw really some strong progress. Rec.gov is a program we've talked about over the years, Rec.gov is doing great and frankly, exceeding our expectations. And like that, we see other upside. What I think we learned as part of VoLT is that the best place for us to innovate is at the mission technology intersection, working in the places where we have strong mission presence, driving really new technology into that. I was at AUSA. A couple of weeks ago, I know a number of people on this call. When there I was talking to clients, and I was watching clients in particular react to some of the things that we're doing around AI and 5G to bring information to the edge in potentially challenging environments. And I tell you the level of excitement there gave me a lot of optimism that we're on the right track. And so when you look at our investments in health and DVA that were in our prepared remarks, when you look at our digital battlespace investments, National Cyber and the like, we think that that's the right path of evolution is to take everything we learned over the last few years and really pour it into these key mission technology intersections that are prime for hyper growth. moment. Thank you. Hey, Sheila. Louie, we go back to the question of state and local every few years. The fact of the matter is Booz Allen does not have a ton of expertise in state and local channels. Our Tracepoint team does a fair amount of work there, and we'll continue that. We're not seeing sort of going into that type of wide space as a major opportunity. Right now, what we see as the major opportunities are to really double down on this mission technology intersections where we have clear presence, clear mission understanding we're bringing in new technology. And then the key point that I think is getting missed in a lot of the conversations is, we can scale. Louie, I don't know if you have the chance to spend time at AUSA, but you see a ton of prototypes. But prototype to mission impact is a very long, challenging road. And that's where I think we, as Booz Allen, are doubling down is the ability to not just bring these technologies and show a client what the technology can become. It's actually to make that technology real. And so while there are opportunities in state and local, there's probably opportunities internationally and a number of other places, and we're not oblivious to all of that. Right now, what we're focused is in creating hypergrowth in some designated mission technology intersections. So there's always seasonality. And Q2 is always a strong quarter for us. I think this Q2 was particularly strong because sometimes those numbers include both our summer interns and sort of college hires. And the bulk of the hiring in this quarter was actually experienced talent. So I think that speaks to the robustness of our talent pipeline and our value proposition with these really critical resources that are so important to our business. Let me give you an example. I mean we always talk about the fact that we're not demand constrained. So we have a significant intelligence contract that is probably scheduled to end next fall. I think, in the September timeframe. And as we look at that, at least some of the work may move to other vehicles, vehicles that we don't hold. But we have so much demand for the talent that is doing that work now for these exquisite classified technical talent that we have opportunities to fill other open reqs across a number of other vehicles in Intel and beyond. And that is really the core of the realm is being able to deploy unique talent to do this work. That's what's actually driving our growth. I mean at this point, the rate limiting step to growth is in Intel, for example, is clear talent, not vehicle availability, which I know we talk -- everybody talks a lot about. And so we're feeling good. We're feeling like the changes that we've made to our recurring process and to our employee value proposition are sustainable. It's still a challenging talent market out there quarter-to-quarter. The numbers will fluctuate, but I think we're on the right track. And let me build on that, sort of the market strategic level. If you look at -- we're well aligned to the administration's domestic agenda strong investment in public health, where we have a tremendous business and a lot of upside. The modernization of the IRS, where we have a long-standing presence and a lot of opportunity, and increasingly, we're focusing on climate and how we can bring technology and AI and those kinds of things to the climate question. But then when you shift over to the National Security side, the national security strategy was just released, and it speaks to this as the defining decade. The National Defense strategy just came out and once again speaks to China as the patient competitor for the U.S. and the need to invest in technology in order to stay ahead of that competition. And all of that, I think Booz Allen is -- really has a unique position that we built over the last decade at the intersection of mission and technology where we are bringing these very new technologies, sometimes do all use technologies between commercial and government in a way that they're scalable into these massive challenges. And so as Matt said, I think the numbers are over time going to reflect the fact that we're well positioned and have strength across all of our markets. Cai, I'm not sure exactly which procurements you're talking about. There are some things that we want that are under protest. So I don't know the specific answer to your question. What I will say is this, a 2.4 very robust book-to-bill quarter that is both a number of significant billion dollar plus task orders and our traditional second quarter strength around tactical sales also returning, which then puts the 12 month book-to-bill in a really good place and puts backlog at record numbers. So at the risk of sounding like a broken record, we really are not demand constrained. The real opportunity for us is to continue to onboard the right talent in order to make sure that we actualize all that demand into revenue. Good morning. I'm not sure. The question broke up a little bit. I mean do you mind repeating it? I got you. I heard burn rate environment, I was not sure it was current rate. Okay, so you're talking about interest rates. We're -- as Matt said, when we were discussing M&A, our capital deployment strategy for the moment remains unchanged. We are looking for strategic accelerators that will actually allow us to accomplish VoLT our investment thesis and accelerate organic growth. We have some good examples of that in the past. We hope EverWatch will be another great example of that as we look forward. When we make an acquisition, we look at three things. In sequence, number one, the opportunity to drive organic growth in the long term. Number two, the cultural fit and the connection to our people. And then number three, the numbers have to make sense. And obviously, with rising rates that raises that bar. But honestly, most of the deals that we look at and pass on never make it to that third question. It's the first two where we say, no, this is not for us. So I'll start, I'm sure Matt will want to add. Actually, defense had a good quarter. It's actually a little bit masked by the fact that our billable expenses in that business were lighter than they've been, lighter than we expected. But as we always say, we think about billable expenses as calories because they carry very little profit margin and very little EBITDA. So if you look underneath that, the revenues produced by our talent, we see real acceleration there. And as Matt pointed out, with new people coming in over the last quarter strongly and good billability for new hires, we think there's organic growth momentum there as there is in the other sectors. I'm going to let Matt take that. I think there's a couple of drivers here. The one key driver is, if you look at the difference between total headcount and client staff headcount, client staff head count is up 4.2%. And -- we've been -- as Matt pointed out, we've been managing costs to make sure that in an inflationary environment, we can manage our rates. We are being prudent, and we create room to continue the investments we need to do under VoLT to secure future growth. About 4.2% client staff growth is really good, and especially in a market like this one. And it's the kind of growth that over time is always sort of sustained our above market growth. The second dynamic, which I talked a little bit about on the key -- on the prepared remarks, is that one of the things Kristine has really has all of us focused on is not just on hiring, but on the process of going from hiring to somebody getting fully billable, which is a process that, frankly, used to take too long at Booz Allen, and we're shortening that significantly. That allows us to get more revenue with a smaller bench, which drives billability, which then drives our ability to invest in talent, our ability to grow, and creates a bit of a virtuous circle here. And I think that's -- I think that's a sustainable driver in the near term as we look at the talent market evolution and what we're doing internally. And I'll finish with the -- again, I mean, 30,000 people at Booz Allen is an exciting number for us and one that speaks of the success we've had over the last few years. From my perspective, we're seeing -- it's a challenging talent environment. I know there were significant announcements about tons of hires over the last couple of years. A lot of that we did not materialize really, there's now conversation about maybe less hiring. We're not seeing that materialize. The environment is challenging. One of the things we said to ourselves under VoLT is we're probably going to have a tech talent shortage that was going to last a decade. And so we spent a lot of time rethinking and retooling our processes so that we can be successful hiring people in a constrained environment over the horizon. Thank you. We're really focused on mission technology intersections, and we're focused on ensuring that our clients have what they need as scalable solutions to solve their problems. Some of that is partnering with people that have amazing technologies, products and solutions. Some of that is things we're developing on our own. And a lot of that is bringing a unique talent base that can actually take something that may be on a commercial shelf or even custom bill for the government and make it real into the mission, make it adapted and make sure that across different environments. And so forth, clients can get real value. And this real value point is when you're going to hear me talk about over and over because there's always the risk that we become infatuated with some new technology, becomes a bit of a buzzword. A lot of money gets spent and no value gets created. And I think for us to continue to be the trusted player that we are in this market, our job is to ensure that we'll bring the technology forward. We help our clients really get value from that. And if you look at our numbers, not just this quarter or this half, but really the last decade, I think they speak to the fact that we've done that successfully, and that we will continue to do that. That's our focus. Thank you. Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for your questions, and thank you for joining us. I hope Matt and I did a good job of conveying our excitement about the strength of this business and the progress we're making on VoLT and on the investment thesis. We feel confident about the future. I keep coming back, we're 30,000 strong now, and we all look with optimism at the opportunities that are ahead for our firm, for our clients, for our people and certainly for our investors.

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you today. First, I want to echo Horacio's sentiments. Lloyd did an outstanding job as CFO. He built a world class team and developed a financial strategy that continues to generate durable value for all of our stakeholders. And on a personal note, Lloyd has been a true friend and a great mentor to me. I'm excited for the opportunity to lead our finance team, to work with Booz Allen's outstanding group of leaders to deliver results and to engage with you along the way. As you know, we said that we wanted to come out of the gates with a strong first half this fiscal year and we did exactly that. These exceptional results position us to exceed our original plan for this fiscal year, even while ramping up strategic investment in the back half of the year to fuel ongoing organic growth. And as Horacio noted, our results put us on track to meet our multiyear investment thesis objectives. Now please turn to Slide 6, as I discuss our fiscal year 2023 second quarter results. I will start by hitting the highlights of our performance. At the top line, revenue grew 9.2% in the second quarter, reflecting growth across all of our markets and particularly strong performance in our Civil business. We generated $286 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, a 6% improvement over the prior year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%. This translated to $1.34 of adjusted diluted earnings per share. And lastly, we deployed $87 million in capital in the quarter exclusive of the EverWatch acquisition, which closed after quarter end. I will now cover the details of our second quarter performance in greater depth. As previously mentioned, for the second quarter, our revenue grew 9.2% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 10.1% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. These results reflect another exceptional quarter of organic revenue growth driven by the ongoing strategic repositioning of our business, strong demand for our solutions, headcount growth and higher staff utilization compared to the prior year's quarter. Our top line performance was supported by revenue growth across all of our markets. In defense, revenue grew approximately 2% year-over-year in part due to lighter billable expenses. That said, in defense, we saw strong hiring throughout the quarter and a number of meaningful wins that we expect will provide good momentum for the back half of our fiscal year and beyond. In Civil, revenue grew by approximately 18% year-over-year, highlighted by particularly strong results in our health account. Our civil performance reflects the power of two pillars of our VoLT strategy, building strategic positions at the intersection of mission and technology, and using targeted acquisitions to accelerate our technical capabilities and organic growth. Our Intelligence business grew by approximately 9% year-over-year. Building on this team's hiring and portfolio shaping efforts, of the past year. And finally, in Global Commercial, revenue grew by approximately 25% year-over-year. In the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our commercial business in MENA, which was a solid but non-core asset. I'm pleased that we found a good home for our clients and employees in the region. Now please turn to Slide 7 for details on our demand signals. Net bookings for the quarter were approximately $5.5 billion, which translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 2.4 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.32 times. Total backlog grew approximately 9.8% year-over-year, resulting in our largest ever backlog of $31.8 billion. We saw growth in all three portions of our backlog. Funded backlog grew 11.3% to $5.5 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 8.9% to $10.4 billion and price options grew 9.8% to $16 billion. These outstanding results once again demonstrate that we are not demand constrained. We continue to win the right type of work to meet both our financial and our strategic aspirations. Pivoting now to headcount, we had an increase of approximately 800 client-serving employees in the second quarter, even after taking into account the roughly 100 employees that exited with our MENA divestiture. This performance was outstanding, particularly in light of what remains a tight labor market. Our client serving headcount is now up approximately 1,100 employees or 4.2% year-over-year. This sets us up very well to continue our top line momentum in the near term. As I mentioned earlier, at the bottom line, we generated $286 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which is up 6% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%, which is down 40 basis points year-over-year, but slightly ahead of our expectations. Our margins continue to benefit from strong contract level execution, a slight mix shift towards higher fee generating work and our ongoing strategic cost management efforts. Based on our strong operating performance and the gain from the sale of our MENA business, partially offset by higher interest expense, net income increased 10.3% year-over-year to $171 million. Adjusted net income was $178 million, up 4.5% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased 12.3% to $1.28 from $1.14 in the prior year period and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6.3% to $1.34 from $1.26. Turning to the balance sheet. We closed the second quarter with a cash balance of $757 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver. In September, we closed on the ninth amendment to our credit agreement. This allows us to continue to optimize our capital stack, including increasing the weighted average maturity of our debt. Free cash flow for the quarter was $257 million, the result of cash generated from operating activities of $273 million, less $16 million of capital expenditures. Turning now to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we returned $87 million of capital to shareholders through $30 million of share repurchases and $57 million in quarterly cash dividends. Net debt at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.1 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.1 times EBITDA. As previously mentioned, after quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of EverWatch. This acquisition is a prime example of a strategic accelerator that will allow us to bring technical and business model innovation to our clients. We are thrilled to welcome the EverWatch team aboard. Our intelligence market team is eager to work with them to expand our deep pipeline of opportunities and to better serve critical national security missions. We anticipate that this transaction will be accretive this fiscal year. Finally, today, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share payable on December 2 to stockholders of record on November 15. I will now address our revised guidance for the full fiscal year 2023. Please turn to Slide 9. At the top line, we are increasing guidance for revenue growth to be between 8% and 10%, which includes inorganic growth of between 1% and 2%. This is due to our strong first half performance, as well as the hiring and bookings momentum that our team has built. We anticipate that revenue growth will moderate slightly in the second half as compared to last fiscal year, which included a seasonally high billable expense mix. We are very pleased with the underlying momentum in our business. Similarly, we are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $975 million to $1.015 billion. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA margin outlook which we now anticipate will be in the high 10% to low 11% range. These increases are based on our revenue outlook, typical seasonal spending and margin patterns and our intent to invest more heavily in the back half of the fiscal year to drive sustainable organic growth. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.50. This increase in ADEPS guidance is driven by our strong operating results, partially offset by a modest increase in interest expense. We still expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $110 million as we continue to invest in infrastructure and technology. Finally, as shown on Slide 10, due to the expected increase in profitability, we now expect our operating cash flow, excluding taxes to be between $875 million and $950 million. Earlier this month, we received a partial tax refund for our prior strategic tax planning initiatives. As a result, our expectation for net cash taxes to be paid this fiscal year has decreased to $315 million, including both a normalized tax rate and the impact of Section 174. This brings our anticipated operating cash flow inclusive of taxes to between $560 million and $635 million for the full fiscal year. In closing, let me echo Horacio again and say how proud I am of our strong performance during the second quarter. This performance was only made possible by the hard work and dedication of our now 30,000 employees. As a result, we remain on target to execute against our strategic and financial objectives, allowing Booz Allen to continue to create superior shareholder value. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks, Sheila. The sort of answer to your question is, no change in strategy. We still view M&A as an accelerant. I think Liberty is a great example of how M&A cannot just catalyze organic growth over time, but brining new capabilities into the fold, as Horacio just discussed. And we see ever watch very much in the same vein. We're really excited to get the team on board after seven months between signing clues, which is something quite frankly, none of us anticipated and early returns are positive. Our team and their team are working together to think through how we can take their technical and business model innovation and combine it with us, ours to bring greater value to clients, and that's going to accelerate organic growth. So we have a strong pipeline. We'd love to follow that playbook, but we're going to remain patient and disciplined. Thanks, Louie. Thank you. Absolutely. I think margins are driven by a couple of factors. One is the mix of our business. So our civil business tends to be a little higher margin than security in Intel. And that's highly correlated, obviously, to contract type. That's where more of our fixed price work exists. Second factor is billable expenses, which in general, we call empty calories, but they do impact EBITDA margin, if not EBITDA itself. And then third is cost management, and we're doing really well on that front, both on the unallowable side and within the rates. But in the short run, we don't really manage our business based on margin. There's a reason we chose EBITDA dollars from an investment thesis perspective, and we think we're really on track there. We're happy with the 6% EBITDA dollar growth that we're demonstrating year-over-year. So margins are important, obviously, but that's not the primary objective. Maybe -- we're doing slightly better than we thought this year. And that obviously, that's reflected in our guidance. Yes and no. I think are we going to see 18%, 20% growth in Civil year-over-year. Probably not, that will come down a bit. We're still working off some of the Liberty accelerant factor, even though it's not in -- it's not in organic growth numbers, but we're still seeing some of the near-term synergies there. But on defense, although, it showed growth in the 2% range, if you pull back, that really was driven by some year-over-year comps from a billable expense perspective, underlying, it's much stronger. So I do think you're going to see a little bit of a normalization across the three markets, but we're very excited with the ongoing performance of Civil and our Health business as well. That is correct, Cai. We're going to hold on giving specific numbers for EverWatch probably until next quarter. As I mentioned, it just closed two weeks ago. The teams are going through original synergy projections in business case. So we built in the overall numbers. But we'll get back to you on that next quarter. That's right, Horacio. We won some really high-quality work in defense. So I would say it has been shaken loose. As Horacio had mentioned, it was a little masked this quarter by some year-over-year billable expense comps. But you'll see over the back half of the year that there's strong momentum in our defense business. Thank you. Yeah. I would say that private equity is backed out, particularly in the mid-tier in our market, not just buyers, but a lot of the sellers are private equity backed. I would describe this as a much more cautious market. Certainly, transaction volume has decreased given all the uncertainty we know from macro factors to interest rates, as Horacio mentioned, the regulatory environment. And what I think you're seeing is that there are fewer large auction processes, and it's a world where relationships and reputation matter. And we really think that plays to our strengths. If you look at how we did Liberty, Tracepoint, EverWatch, they're all outside of processes, they were targets that we identified that we thought met the criteria Horacio outlined. And we really took the time to get to know them and make sure it was the right fit, not just for us but for them. So I think you're going to see more of that. I'm seeing more of that personally, having a different set of relationships with not just strategics, but a lot of private equity buyers and sellers. So no, I wouldn't say the private equity firms are out of the market. That hasn't been our experience. And Horacio, if I can just add. The third factor to the two you mentioned headcount growth and utilization, our wages have increased. And for the 75% of our contract base, our cost plus and T&M contracts, were for the most part we can pass those through. That's driving revenue as well. We see that every year. When salaries go up, and we're certainly seeing more of that this year than we have in the past. So I'll take the first part of your question first. I think that model is the one we're following. As Horacio said, we are on track for the investment thesis, not just in aggregate. But I think if you look at the piece parts of how it's playing out, organic growth, inorganic and the like, it's playing out how we expected. On the second part, I'm not sure I understood the question. With 4.2% year-over-year consulting staff headcount growth and the momentum we see in the business, that's right on track with where we want to be, and I think it's in line with the model that you articulated. So we've said that we expect wage inflation this year in the 3.5% to 4.5% range and we're within that down probably a little bit towards the higher end, which is higher than years past, but honestly not significantly higher than in years past."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. First, I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Nathan Rutledge, the new Director and Head of Investor Relations for Booz Allen. I'm excited to be here and for the opportunity to serve you. I look forward to working with you all.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and welcome to the team. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call.  This morning, Lloyd and I are happy to share strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. During our May earnings call, we said the pattern of growth for this fiscal year would be predicated on growing momentum in the first half to mitigate the likelihood of uncertainties in the second half.  Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are building the strategic momentum and operational resilience required to meet our expectations for this fiscal year and achieve our multiyear financial objectives.  Revenue growth for this quarter was excellent, and we grew across all markets. The bottom line was consistent with our plans for the year. In short, we are on track both towards this year's guidance and towards our multiyear goal of growing adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. Lloyd will walk you through the quarter's results and our full year outlook in depth.  But before we go on, I'd like to pause a moment to share some upcoming leadership changes. After 20 years with Booz Allen, Karen Dahut, President of our Global Defense sector is retiring effective October 31. Karen has had an impressive career at Booz Allen to include the initial standup of our Strategic Innovation Group, leadership of our civil and commercial businesses and for the past 5 years, heading up our largest business sector. Karen's leadership and creativity have had a tremendous impact on our firm and our clients. We are grateful for all her contributions and we wish her well.  I am very excited to announce that Executive Vice President, Judi Dotson, currently, the Head of our National Security sector, will transition to the role of President of Global Defense. Judi is an outstanding leader, who we credit with repositioning and driving growth and performance across our national security sector. With decades of experience across all our markets, Judi brings to her new role, both the experience and the vision to accelerate our defense business in line with our VoLT strategy.  Additionally, I am pleased to share that we have named Executive Vice President, Tom Fifer, as the new President of the National Securities sector. Tom has been at Booz Allen for over 3 decades and has a track record of igniting growth everywhere he has been. Working closely with Judi for the past 2 years, Tom has been instrumental in driving growth across our National Security portfolio.  I'm excited by both the depth and breadth of talent that we have at Booz Allen and the opportunities that this natural transition create for our leaders. Our team is tested in these markets and will undoubtedly continue to deliver exceptional results for our clients and for the firm.  Now back to the business at hand. Let me take a few moments to discuss how our strategic momentum and operational resilience position us for success.  In terms of strategic momentum, we continue to advance the agenda we discussed at our Investor Day last October. Our VoLT strategy, which stands for velocity, leadership and technology is both our future and our present. We're leaning forward across a broad array of mission and technology opportunities primed for hyper growth because they're central to where our clients are heading. We're leveraging our strategic first mover advantage and our ability to invest and deploy capital to bring digital innovation to mission challenges and help our clients transform at speed. National cyber is a good example of one of the hyper growth mission areas where we're leaning forward.  For well over 2 decades, we have been innovating with the intelligence community on cyber trade craft. We're gaining traction as we now extend that expertise horizontally across the entire cyber domain to broader set of defense and civilian missions. Corresponding to changing policy to outpacing morphing threats, we continue to expand our position on cyber missions. For example, through solutions that integrate leading-edge commercial technology with our unique understanding of our clients' operational environments, we are helping agencies implement Zero Trust architectures. This is in response to the White House guidance to strengthen cybersecurity. And our team is very excited about winning new cyber work at NASA this quarter.  The Cypress contract builts on our long-standing support of NASA missions. Through this work, we are deploying our intelligence great tradecraft to deliver differentiated next-generation cyber defense solutions across all of NASA.  Another area of increasing momentum is our refreshed innovation agenda, which includes both internal initiatives and a broad mix of external partnerships and investments. Earlier this month, we announced the launch of Booz Allen Ventures, a $100 million corporate venture capital arm that further codifies our ongoing commitment to investing companies innovating in defense, AI, machine learning, cyber and other leading-edge technologies.  This is a natural expansion of our tech scouting and partnership network that we have used to bring dozens of companies with innovative technologies on to critical government programs. Client and overall market feedback on these efforts reinforce the value we can bring by bridging between mission requirements and the start-up community.  Shifting now to operational resiliency. We acknowledge volatility in the external environment is likely to increase over the coming months as the combination of high inflation, new COVID waves, continued geopolitical instability and the potential for an acrimonious political season are becoming more real. As we have done in the past, we look to take advantage of our flexible operating model and to focus relentlessly on the things we can control.  Along those lines, last May, I outlined four operational priorities for the year. Let me describe our progress across this agenda. First, we said we must hire aggressively to fully capitalize on our backlog and growing pipeline. In the first quarter, we saw sequential acceleration in our hiring, which we believe will continue through the summer. Our employee value proposition continues to attract the type of talent we want and we need to serve our clients.  Also importantly, under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, Kristine Martin Anderson, we are making significant progress in driving efficiencies and speed into the entire talent acquisition life cycle. This includes getting new hires ramped up more quickly on client work upon joining the firm.  These improvements will enable faster growth of our workforce while also enhancing the experience of our candidate journeys to become Booz Allen employees.  Second, we said we must continue our track record of winning work aligned to our clients' highest mission priorities. Demand remains strong across the portfolio, as our clients look to us to help them innovating their missions and navigate this type of historic economic, geopolitical and technological change. With the budget in place, through the end of the government fiscal year, we are experiencing a very robust procurement season, which we expect to continue through the summer.  Third, we said we will continue to manage the business tightly to enable investment in our talent and strategic priorities while delivering on our bottom line commitments. Our leaders are effectively controlling costs and executing the business fundamentals with precision as shown in our bottom line results this quarter. This enables our future growth by supporting our hypergrowth businesses, our innovation agenda and most of all, our people.  And fourth, we must deploy capital in a way that creates maximum value and drives our strategy forward. In the past few months, we have remained active in building our M&A pipeline focusing on acquisitions that will accelerate our VoLT strategy. I firmly believe that strategic M&A, like our proposed acquisition of EverWatch increases both innovation and competition, and that the interest of the government and strategic acquirers are fully aligned. We remain disciplined and committed to deploying capital in a manner consistent with our investment thesis.  So in closing, we are off to a strong start, and our first quarter results demonstrate we are on track to deliver on our full fiscal year and multiyear financial goals. We're building momentum under VoLT, while focusing on key priorities that will accelerate our growth and -- our resiliency, both in the near and medium term.  Every day, watching our talented colleagues lead, win work, serve clients and manage this business with such skill and accuracy gives me great confidence. And it is because of them that we have the results we're able to discuss with you today.  With that, Lloyd, over to you to take us through the financials in depth.\nLloyd Howell: Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance reflects our focus on growing the business profitably as we seek to grow adjusted EBITDA dollars by approximately 50% through fiscal year 2025. These results were supported by a top line that exceeded our expectations as we deliver on our goal to achieve industry-leading organic revenue growth. Our disciplined strategy across the business drove robust margins while we continue to optimize our balance sheet and create capital deployment opportunities that will deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.  Importantly, our approach is working, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering exceptional operational and financial performance, which keeps us on track to execute against our long-term financial objectives.  Let's now turn to our first quarter results on Slide 6. At the top line, total revenue increased 13.1% for the first quarter to $2.2 billion. Organic revenue grew approximately 8% to $2.1 billion, with approximately $103 million of inorganic contributions. Revenue excluding billable expenses also grew 9.9% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. These results highlight our ability to convert sustained demand for our services and solutions by efficiently hiring and deploying our growing talent base. And as expected, our billable expense mix is normalizing towards the midpoint of our 29% to 31% target range, which was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases this quarter.  At the market level, we are pleased with the momentum and growth across all of our markets. We believe that -- expertise and leading-edge capabilities will continue to support durability of demand and provides visibility into future growth prospects as we continue to shape and execute the right type of work aligned to the hypergrowth areas we want to compete in.  Revenue growth for the first quarter was led by our civil business, which grew approximately 28% year-over-year, approximately 12% of which was organic. This marks our second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. These results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which continues to yield exciting new wins. And with Liberty now fully integrated into our civil market, we are looking forward to further leveraging our combined capabilities, relationships and mission expertise to pursue additional opportunities and grow our market share.  In defense, revenue grew by approximately 5% over the prior year period, reflecting our second consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth as we continue to build momentum across the entire portfolio. Demand remained strong, and we continue to double down on our hiring efforts as we ramp up recent contract wins and quickly deploy talent towards capturing high-value opportunities.  Across defense, in all of our markets, we remain steadfast in positioning ourselves to be the leading digital solutions provider to the U.S. government, transforming the way they adopt and integrate new technologies. Horacio described our progress on National Cyber. We also continue to innovate the digital battle space to bring differentiated scaled solutions to the joint warfighting mission. We view each of these platforms as growth accelerators for our markets and look forward to updating you along their journey.  And similarly, within intel, we continue to see momentum build with revenue growing by approximately 8% over the prior year, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Despite a few larger awards shifting to the right, we remain energized by the pace and volume of award activity, including our pipeline of opportunities that we expect will provide exciting new growth prospects this fiscal year.  And lastly, in global commercial, which accounts for roughly 3% of our total portfolio, revenue grew by approximately 45%, of which 20% was organic.  Now on to Slide 7 for details on our demand signals. Net bookings for the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.72x and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.21x. This quarterly book-to-bill number reflects our ongoing expectations for choppiness in quarterly book-to-bill results as we pursue larger and more technically complex bids, which is why we continue to point to our strong trailing 12-month book-to-bill results as a better indicator of sustained demand.  Total backlog grew approximately 6.8% year-over-year to $28.6 billion. Funded backlog grew 15.1% to $4 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 10.7% to $10 billion. And price options grew 2.3% to $15 billion.  Looking ahead, with a budget in place and funding available, we have already seen the release of large awards and our RFP submission value and volume are both up over the prior year. In addition, we continue to work in close collaboration with our clients who indicate their desire to issue awards before the government fiscal year end. With each of these integral parts in motion, we are optimistic in our ability to continue translating strong demand signals into top line growth.  Pivoting to headcount. As of June 30, we had approximately 29,300 employees, an increase of approximately 750 year-over-year or 2.6%, most of which was organic growth. Client staff headcount grew approximately 975 year-over-year or 3.8%. As Horacio emphasized, successful execution of our hiring strategy is a top operational priority in meeting the shifting needs of our business. Accordingly, we continue to be laser-focused on headcount growth and retaining our talent to keep pace with our plan, allowing us to deliver another year of mid-single-digit growth.  Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA was $253 million in the first quarter, up 6.1% from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% is approximately 70 basis points lower than the same period a year ago. Margins benefited from strong profitable contract level performance and mix, which was more than offset by higher indirect costs, reflecting our growing talent base and increased salaries. In addition, higher unallowable spend and billable expense mix, both of which we forecasted will normalize as we return to prepandemic business patterns, weighed on the results in the quarter.  As we move through the duration of this fiscal year, we expect a similar seasonality to our margin performance, which factors into our expectation that our billable expense mix will remain near the midpoint of our 29% to 31% range while unallowable spend will pick up incrementally, both of which will weigh on margins.  First quarter net income increased 49.9% year-over-year to $138 million. Adjusted net income was $151 million, up 3.4% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased 53.7% to $1.03 from $0.67 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.6% to $1.13 from $1.07.  Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher interest and D&A expenses. These increases were partially offset by a lower share count due to share repurchases made in line with our disciplined capital deployment strategy.  Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $59 million, the result of cash used in operating activities of negative $46 million and capital expenditures of $14 million. Cash from operations was seasonally light as strong collections were offset by higher disbursements and onetime payroll items associated with administrative staffing changes completed last quarter and other businesses transactions.  Incremental to the quarter was approximately $50 million of collections that shifted into the second quarter due to system outages and corresponding payment delays at one of our primary government payment agencies, all of which has since been received. We ended the first quarter with a strong cash balance of nearly $500 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver.  Turning to Slide 8. During the first quarter, we returned $160 million of capital to shareholders, consisting of $58 million of share repurchases at an average share price of $83.50 and $59 million in quarterly cash dividends. Net debt at the end of the year was approximately $2.3 billion and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.4x, reflecting our strong balance sheet.  We continue to look for opportunities to optimize our capital structure as it will provide us the capacity to deliver against our capital deployment plans and create accretive long-term value for our shareholders.  Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, payable on August 1 to stockholders of record on August 15, as well as an increase of $400 million to our share repurchase authorization, bringing our remaining available capacity to approximately $1 billion.  Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2023 guidance. As we discussed last quarter, the first half, second half dynamics we provided are still the guiding framework for our full fiscal year growth expectations. We expect revenue growth to be between 5% and 9%, inclusive of inorganic contributions. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $950 million and $1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid- to high 10% range. We expect operating cash flow to be between $850 million and $950 million, which excludes our expectations for approximately $550 million of cash tax headwinds this fiscal year.  As detailed on Slide 10, let me break our cash taxes down into three components. First, approximately $200 million is associated with our forecasted pretax income and annual effective tax rate. Second, another approximately $200 million is associated with strategic planning initiatives undertaken in prior fiscal years. We expect to receive tax refunds in future years related to the strategic tax planning initiatives. And third, the remaining approximately $150 million is associated with Section 174. While we believe that it could be deferred or repealed, we are basing our assumptions on the prevailing legislation.  Taken together, for fiscal year 2023, $350 million of cash tax payments are associated with timing or onetime headwinds that we do not expect to repeat, barring future tax planning initiatives that we may execute. We will start making cash tax payments against these items starting in our second fiscal quarter, but expect our operating cash flow performance will still follow a normal cadence to previous years.  As shown on Slide 11, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.45 based on an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% and $131 million to $133 million average weighted shares outstanding. If our share price keeps pace with the performance of the most recent quarter, we expect the reduction in share count will net near the high end of our guided range. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million as we continue to meaningfully invest in our infrastructure and technology.  In closing, I'll reiterate that we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Booz Allen continues to be on a solid path to execute on our long-term objectives of delivering strong organic growth and driving superior shareholder value. Our management team is excited about the momentum we have already generated to meet our multiyear financial goals.  With that, Nathan, let's open the line for questions.\nNathan Rutledge: Thanks, Lloyd. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies\nSheila Kahyaoglu: And congrats -- I want to ask a specific question actually just on the civil growth, given it was so robust, up 12%. How do you guys think about the drivers of that, whether it's catch-up in delayed procurements or new contracts, but you also mentioned some new health care wins. So maybe if you could talk about that and how Liberty has helped contribute to your increase in market share?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Why don't I start? As you said, well, we're very pleased with the growth of the entire portfolio in this quarter. It gives us the momentum and the operational resilience that we're looking for to navigate both this year and the multiyear financial envelope that we have created. And again, I mean, first quarter demonstrates both at the top and the bottom line that we are very much on track.  All three markets grew in the quarter pretty robustly and health was the standout in civil, but the entire civil business is growing quite well. Health has been a very solid, close to double-digit grower organically for now quite some time. And the drivers there are unique position in some of these accounts in terms of helping them drive the digital transformation of those businesses, which positions us against procurements, I think, in a very unique way. And we continue to capture both share and share of mind really in the minds of our clients as they look to transform those organizations.  But in addition to that, our -- what we call citizen services, which is everything around the Treasury IRS and that entire portfolio has now a very robust pipeline that is looking really good because, again, those agencies are looking for the same kinds of federal -- of digital transformation efforts that we are positioned against.  And then lastly, we are focusing the third leg of our civil stool around really issues of domestic resilience and climate change that I think that are clearly beginning to get significant traction.  So when you put it all together, going back to the notion of VoLT, we are focusing on the hypergrowth areas where we believe the greatest opportunities are going to be, and I think, again, first quarter demonstrates we're on track.\nLloyd Howell: Sheila, this is Lloyd. The only thing I would add to your Liberty question, it really has been a strategic accelerator. As we said previously, that's our strategy when it comes to M&A. And financially, we saw $92 million from Liberty inorganically as a contribution. So it's really integrating well, and we're on pace to have a solid year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nGavin Parsons: It's Gavin Parsons. Appreciate all the color on the hiring environment. I just wanted to ask for a little bit of an update there. It looks like you're well on track for the target of mid-single digits for the year. Are you seeing any impact of a less tight labor market in the tech industry? Can you talk a little bit more about just the traction, your initiatives you're having and how that's going?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Yes, as you point out, I think we're very much on track towards our targets there, and we are seeing really sequential almost month-over-month increasing momentum and increasing growth on our hiring. It continues to be a competitive labor market. We are getting in a lot of talent. We see pre-COVID levels of attrition. But overall, we're gaining ground because our value proposition continues to be very strong. The type of work we do, the way in which we do it and the suite of compensation and benefits that we offer our employees is very much competitive really everybody in the market, and differentiated really from most people in the market.  In terms of color, I would point you to a couple of things that have me excited. One is we've seen in the last few months, the return of a few senior leaders. So we had lost two others that we didn't want to lose who now are coming back perhaps after seeing whether the grass is greener on the other side. And I think that speaks well to our value proposition and the sustainability of that proposition through market changes.  And then the second thing that has me excited is our Chief Operating Officer, Kristine Martin Anderson, is driving an agenda that is really looking to improve the candidate experience but also shorten the cycle from when we need a person to when that person becomes billable. There's a number of things we can do to really get from need to revenue, if you will, faster, which is obviously good for us, but it's also good for the candidates. Nobody wants to start a job slowly. Everybody wants to hit the deck running. So I think all of that positions us well for the year and beyond.\nGavin Parsons: Got it. I appreciate it. And then maybe just a clarification on cash taxes. It sounds like some of the -- the $200 million headwind this year could possibly reverse in the future. I mean, is your expectation that your go-forward cash tax rate will be 23% to 25%, and the headwind this year could reverse in future periods?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, you got it right, Gavin. We're seeing between 23% and 25% going forward. And the $200 million associated with our strategic planning initiatives in prior years will come back to us. I can't tell you now exactly when it will come back to us, but it will, we expect, come back to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Colin Canfield with Barclays.\nColin Canfield: Can you remind us on the margin drivers in the quarter? So a couple of moving pieces that we talked about at the Investor Day, call it, roughly 10.5%, mid-10% guide to that FY '25 target, but then we get 11.2% in the quarter. So maybe if you could talk about the level of investment that you saw in this quarter and how that kind of unfolds over a multiyear period?\nLloyd Howell: Sure. Well, let's start with how happy I am with the fact that we're out of the gates with 11.2%. And it really is a reflection of continued solid contract performance. And quite frankly, as the business has opened up, we're seeing an -- spend and billable expense mix start to normalize in addition to that higher indirect spend.  We are in the early stages of investment, particularly around cyber platform, as you heard in our prepared remarks and digital battle space. So at this point, investment really is I would characterize it as organizing our leadership, recruiting the right leaders, things of that sort. I think where that will put us over the course of the year is how I've guided, which is mid- to high 10s. So we will exceed some more investment over the course of the year. But the guidance range that I provided so far is what I would use going forward.  And also just to close it out, it's also kind of back to our normalized pattern, where in the first half of the year, we do see higher margin performance. But in the second half of the year is where we typically invest in our people, infrastructure and technology.\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll just add one quick point, which is that our North Star financially is EBITDA dollar growth. And we're looking at a year where we're trying to deliver $950 million to $1 billion and then accelerate in future years to get to the ultimate goal of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And so as Lloyd points out, we are managing cost, we're managing the business and ultimately, we're keeping a close eye on margin. But ultimately, we want to grow EBITDA dollars, which really starts with organic revenue growth and everything else that we're doing.\nColin Canfield: Got it. And then maybe one more on capital allocation. But if you could talk about kind of the desire to get capital intensity within capital allocation. Obviously, kind of the cyclical headcount backdrop that we think about weaker commercial IT hiring help you guys, but at the same time, you can make the argument that we're entering a structurally impaired demographic environment. So then if we think about how that affects capital allocation, and especially kind of the headcount departure dynamics -- acquired names?\nLloyd Howell: I'll start. I'm pleased with the fact that we feel we've got the right levers in terms of allocating capital, and for the benefit of our shareholders, the near, mid and long term. And with those levers, it gives us a great deal of flexibility to do that. This particular quarter, $58 million in repos, $59 million in quarterly dividend. And the fact that we've got a growing pipeline of strategic M&A opportunities really sets us up, I think, to deploy against what we've stated for the long-term objective.  Obviously, when we look at some of the M&A opportunities, we have to take into account the talent base and the cultural integration. And that comes even way before sort of what the financial implications are. But that goes hand in hand with how we think about our M&A opportunities. And so far, so good. In the case of Liberty, we had a really good experience there, and we're looking to replicate future deals along those lines.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: And good quarter. So most of your peers are talking about the fact that bookings have been slow, but we have a very robust FY '22 budget. And so we're expecting a particularly strong seasonally fourth quarter of the fiscal year, this current quarter. Could you comment, do you agree with that? That's also normally your strongest quarter. And could you update us on the two large contracts that were protested, the $1.1 billion, I think, the NGA and the classified defense contract, that status?\nLloyd Howell: Cai, it's Lloyd. I'll start. What we have historically seen is our traditional quarterly book-to-bill pattern really starting to change in light of these larger procurements that can be awarded at any point in our fiscal year. So when you look at our Q1 of 0.72x, that's really a result of not having one of these larger procurement hit, as you saw in our Q4 of last fiscal year. That being said, we internally look at the trailing 12 months of 1.21x as a better indicator as to the demand signal, and we're seeing strong demand signals, particularly with our backlog up 6.7% as well as continued growth in that regard.  As to things shifting, with the exception of 1 or 2 contracts, we're not really seeing a lot of things shifting at this point in the year. And I would say that as we look towards next quarter, we're really seeing, as you point out, continuing to be a seasonally strong quarter for us, and we're already seeing larger awards being released, an uptick in RFPs and strong indications that our clients are going to move out before the end of the government fiscal year.  As to the large protests, it's approximately $1.1 billion in total. As you know, we are in an environment that is heavily protested. We are optimistic that the things that are under protest will ultimately will prevail. But it's sort of an environment, as you know, where it's heavily protested.\nCai von Rumohr: And you mentioned EverWatch. DOJ, as you know, is challenging your proposed acquisition. I think they're asserting that if you bought EverWatch, you'd have a quasi-monopoly with an important customer. Could you comment, what is your response to that? And what is the status of that proposed acquisition?\nHoracio Rozanski: Cai, why don't I take that one. Thank you for asking that question. I'll start by saying this is important. As part of VoLT, being VoLT is around velocity. And it is the notion that the right acquisitions accelerate our ability to bring the right capabilities to our clients in our environment where our clients need to move faster and need us to help them move faster. And so we look at acquisitions including EverWatch through that lens. And we do believe, and strongly stand by the statement that EverWatch is not -- if the consummating that acquisition will not just be good for Booz Allen, it would actually be good for our clients. For sort of a further reading, I would point you to -- we filed our answer last Friday to the DOJ claim and I'm not a lawyer, so I'm just going to let you read that answer. I think it's very well done and it stands for .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel.\nBert Subin: Horacio, just for you. You talked about cyber in the beginning in your prepared remarks, and most of your peers also talk about their own differentiation in cyber. What do you think Booz is doing differently here that's ultimately going to get you to that $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in EBITDA target? I'm just wondering if you could highlight why you think you'll have an advantage on the cyber front.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you for that question. I would characterize our position as one of first mover advantage. We have been working with the intelligence community on some of the toughest cyber challenges going on for decades. I can point you to Mike McConnell, who is former Director of Booz Allen in the mid-'90s. And since then, we've been building both the position, the capabilities and the workforce which now it's a few months old, but I think it was rated as the largest cyber workforce in North America, that we clearly both have the scale and the know-how.  What our National Cyber platform allows us to do is take that very unique tradecraft and make it available in the correct ways more broadly across a set of missions that deeply require it. Certainly, as you know, in DoD, cyber is now 1 of 5 warfighter domains. And the ability to serve those missions with that unique tradecraft is going to serve us well.  Also, and I think you've seen this in some of the releases because of our unique position, we tend to attract unique partners, both large and small, highly innovative companies that have tremendous new capabilities that, I think are going to be very significant to this fight.  And then the last point I would make around cyber is because of both the breadth and the depth of our efforts, we're able to attract a unique workforce that once you come here, wants to be at Booz Allen and can serve again, not just against our traditional clients, but I talked in the prepared remarks about the Cypress contract at NASA and a number of other opportunities that are in the pipeline. But I think, again, position Booz Allen uniquely both in terms of breadth, scale and depth in a way that nobody else can do.\nBert Subin: Just a follow-up to that. You mentioned five sort of dimensions of the battle space. Obviously, space itself has sort of come into the conversation more over the last couple of years. You've won some contracts with NASA. Can you talk about what's your sort of growth aspirations with Space Agency are?\nHoracio Rozanski: They're significant. I think there's clearly an opportunity to use technology in a different way to transform our position in space. This is both around being able to aggregate data from all of these space collection systems and providing them to the war fighter in unique ways. That's a lot of what our digital battle space capability is about; work that we are already doing in space that can be transformed by some of the work that we're doing. And then really some of these intersections because we talk about five war fighting domains but they're not separate from each other. . So space and cyber, for example, to connect both of your questions are tightly linked. And we have a unique capacity and capability to bring those two perspectives together in a way that really will benefit both the Department of Defense and the nation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatthew Akers: I wanted to follow up on Cai's point about EverWatch, and we've obviously seen kind of regulatory pressure around M&A. Curious how you see that kind of across the companies that you look at -- and sort of if that shapes sort of the shift toward a little bit more M&A that you've talked about?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. I guess I'll reiterate, we feel that M&A for us is a strategic accelerator, is very much consistent with VoLT, and is a top capital deployment priority. So we expect to continue building the pipeline. And we expect to continue to be successful down that path. We have a strategy around VoLT that we are following. And I'll reiterate, I really do believe that the right acquisitions are both good for Booz Allen certainly, but also good for our clients and ultimately, increase competition.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. I guess to clarify on the cash tax kind of the incremental $200 million. Is that something that they're still sort of tax planning efforts that maybe shift and possibly be better? Or is that $200 million kind of pretty solid at this point?\nLloyd Howell: Yes, it's pretty solid at this point. We, over the years, our tax planning strategies really created some positive tailwinds. And the IRS is looking at our amended returns and we expect that it's going to come back to us. It's just a timing matter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rocco Barbero  with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: Are you guys able to provide an update on your visibility to the second half where there is a little more caution on the ?\nLloyd Howell: Our guidance for the year, 5% to 9% really took into account a number of elements that have yet to play out. Certainly, when we come up on the midterm elections, that could have an impact. Certainly, the next COVID variant in terms of the productivity of our workforce, the geopolitical conflicts that are going on. So we've got a little bit more uncertainty in the back half, but how we've tried to capture that is having a little bit wider guidance range for the year, 5% to 9%. As we get -- approach the second half, we'll have a little bit, I hope, clarity as to where things are going to break.  But again, to reiterate, Horacio's comment at the beginning, we're really building momentum certainly in this quarter. We're looking to do the same in the second quarter. And that will, we believe, help us sort of navigate the uncertainty in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist.\nTobey Sommer: Along the same lines of the back half of the fiscal year, what are you hearing and assuming for a budget in fiscal '23 out of the U.S. government? And does your guidance assume movement there or a continuing resolution?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think our guidance assumes increased volatility, which ultimately says, we are not trying to predict exactly what will happen. I think a continuing resolution is quite possible in the current environment. We certainly saw that at the beginning of this year. And so as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are focused on what we can control. And what we can control is our ability to hire people and get them on contract as quickly as possible, our ability to continue to win the right kind of work that's consistent with VoLT, our desire to manage costs so that we can both invest and provide some resilience against the volatility, the inflationary pressures in the environment and ultimately continue to pursue strategic M&A.  So when you put all of that together, I feel really good about the first quarter because it demonstrates that we're both building momentum and resilience against this year and the potential volatility in the second half, or more broadly against the time frame of our entire investment thesis and the fact that VoLT is working.\nTobey Sommer: And I wanted to ask a follow-up on EverWatch. I want to get your sense for exactly how important this is, this dispute because it seems like the DOJ is sort of defining a contract as a market. And what the outcome of this and this sort of regulatory approach to mean to your ongoing strategy to be more active in terms of acquisitions?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think as you probably know, we're talking about a relatively small contract that's at the center of all of this. Again, I would point you to the answer we filed last Friday as a sort of comprehensive view about our view of sort of what is the right way to proceed and why we believe acquisitions like EverWatch are both good for us and good for our clients.  And so at this point, we continue to build the pipeline. We continue to prioritize strategic acquisitions. And we hope to prevail on this one, but this is our strategy, and it's really around increasing our velocity.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you very much. Thank you all for your questions this morning and for joining us. Close on a bit of a personal reflection. Next week, I'll celebrate my 30th anniversary with Booz Allen, and it's a time of reflection when you think about what kept you here, a whole career where perhaps that wasn't the original intention when I joined in the early '90s. And I come back to -- there are many factors, but the central one for me has been the people of Booz Allen, the people have had an opportunity to work with. And on these earnings calls, Lloyd and I have the honor of representing the collective achievements of our colleagues. There's now over 29,000 people at Booz Allen, and they really are our greatest asset. And as you heard on this call, given the work that we do, many people think of them and I think of them as a national asset as well. And through some really volatile and trying times, our people have continued to persevere and they've shown unwavering commitment to our clients' missions, to our communities and personal to me, to each other. Their catalysts for change, their passion for doing good is inspirational and healing. And the impact of their work shows not only in the results we discussed today, but also in the lasting change they make our clients' missions and to our nation and even the world.  Dr. Martin Luther King once said that only when it's dark enough can you see the stars. And in the current environment, these days, we are living in moments that are times can indeed feel very dark. And our people, our Booz Allen stars, if you will, are the guiding light for all of us. They're best proof points of our firm's fundamental strength and resilience because they live our purpose and values each and every day. So if you'll allow me today, I'd like to just close with a simple thank you. Thank you to the people Booz Allen for all you do each and every day and for what you've done for me over 30 years. And to those of you on this call, again, thank you for being here, and thank you for joining us. Have a great day and a great rest of the summer.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and welcome to the team. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call.  This morning, Lloyd and I are happy to share strong results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. During our May earnings call, we said the pattern of growth for this fiscal year would be predicated on growing momentum in the first half to mitigate the likelihood of uncertainties in the second half.  Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are building the strategic momentum and operational resilience required to meet our expectations for this fiscal year and achieve our multiyear financial objectives.  Revenue growth for this quarter was excellent, and we grew across all markets. The bottom line was consistent with our plans for the year. In short, we are on track both towards this year's guidance and towards our multiyear goal of growing adjusted EBITDA to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. Lloyd will walk you through the quarter's results and our full year outlook in depth.  But before we go on, I'd like to pause a moment to share some upcoming leadership changes. After 20 years with Booz Allen, Karen Dahut, President of our Global Defense sector is retiring effective October 31. Karen has had an impressive career at Booz Allen to include the initial standup of our Strategic Innovation Group, leadership of our civil and commercial businesses and for the past 5 years, heading up our largest business sector. Karen's leadership and creativity have had a tremendous impact on our firm and our clients. We are grateful for all her contributions and we wish her well.  I am very excited to announce that Executive Vice President, Judi Dotson, currently, the Head of our National Security sector, will transition to the role of President of Global Defense. Judi is an outstanding leader, who we credit with repositioning and driving growth and performance across our national security sector. With decades of experience across all our markets, Judi brings to her new role, both the experience and the vision to accelerate our defense business in line with our VoLT strategy.  Additionally, I am pleased to share that we have named Executive Vice President, Tom Fifer, as the new President of the National Securities sector. Tom has been at Booz Allen for over 3 decades and has a track record of igniting growth everywhere he has been. Working closely with Judi for the past 2 years, Tom has been instrumental in driving growth across our National Security portfolio.  I'm excited by both the depth and breadth of talent that we have at Booz Allen and the opportunities that this natural transition create for our leaders. Our team is tested in these markets and will undoubtedly continue to deliver exceptional results for our clients and for the firm.  Now back to the business at hand. Let me take a few moments to discuss how our strategic momentum and operational resilience position us for success.  In terms of strategic momentum, we continue to advance the agenda we discussed at our Investor Day last October. Our VoLT strategy, which stands for velocity, leadership and technology is both our future and our present. We're leaning forward across a broad array of mission and technology opportunities primed for hyper growth because they're central to where our clients are heading. We're leveraging our strategic first mover advantage and our ability to invest and deploy capital to bring digital innovation to mission challenges and help our clients transform at speed. National cyber is a good example of one of the hyper growth mission areas where we're leaning forward.  For well over 2 decades, we have been innovating with the intelligence community on cyber trade craft. We're gaining traction as we now extend that expertise horizontally across the entire cyber domain to broader set of defense and civilian missions. Corresponding to changing policy to outpacing morphing threats, we continue to expand our position on cyber missions. For example, through solutions that integrate leading-edge commercial technology with our unique understanding of our clients' operational environments, we are helping agencies implement Zero Trust architectures. This is in response to the White House guidance to strengthen cybersecurity. And our team is very excited about winning new cyber work at NASA this quarter.  The Cypress contract builts on our long-standing support of NASA missions. Through this work, we are deploying our intelligence great tradecraft to deliver differentiated next-generation cyber defense solutions across all of NASA.  Another area of increasing momentum is our refreshed innovation agenda, which includes both internal initiatives and a broad mix of external partnerships and investments. Earlier this month, we announced the launch of Booz Allen Ventures, a $100 million corporate venture capital arm that further codifies our ongoing commitment to investing companies innovating in defense, AI, machine learning, cyber and other leading-edge technologies.  This is a natural expansion of our tech scouting and partnership network that we have used to bring dozens of companies with innovative technologies on to critical government programs. Client and overall market feedback on these efforts reinforce the value we can bring by bridging between mission requirements and the start-up community.  Shifting now to operational resiliency. We acknowledge volatility in the external environment is likely to increase over the coming months as the combination of high inflation, new COVID waves, continued geopolitical instability and the potential for an acrimonious political season are becoming more real. As we have done in the past, we look to take advantage of our flexible operating model and to focus relentlessly on the things we can control.  Along those lines, last May, I outlined four operational priorities for the year. Let me describe our progress across this agenda. First, we said we must hire aggressively to fully capitalize on our backlog and growing pipeline. In the first quarter, we saw sequential acceleration in our hiring, which we believe will continue through the summer. Our employee value proposition continues to attract the type of talent we want and we need to serve our clients.  Also importantly, under the leadership of our Chief Operating Officer, Kristine Martin Anderson, we are making significant progress in driving efficiencies and speed into the entire talent acquisition life cycle. This includes getting new hires ramped up more quickly on client work upon joining the firm.  These improvements will enable faster growth of our workforce while also enhancing the experience of our candidate journeys to become Booz Allen employees.  Second, we said we must continue our track record of winning work aligned to our clients' highest mission priorities. Demand remains strong across the portfolio, as our clients look to us to help them innovating their missions and navigate this type of historic economic, geopolitical and technological change. With the budget in place, through the end of the government fiscal year, we are experiencing a very robust procurement season, which we expect to continue through the summer.  Third, we said we will continue to manage the business tightly to enable investment in our talent and strategic priorities while delivering on our bottom line commitments. Our leaders are effectively controlling costs and executing the business fundamentals with precision as shown in our bottom line results this quarter. This enables our future growth by supporting our hypergrowth businesses, our innovation agenda and most of all, our people.  And fourth, we must deploy capital in a way that creates maximum value and drives our strategy forward. In the past few months, we have remained active in building our M&A pipeline focusing on acquisitions that will accelerate our VoLT strategy. I firmly believe that strategic M&A, like our proposed acquisition of EverWatch increases both innovation and competition, and that the interest of the government and strategic acquirers are fully aligned. We remain disciplined and committed to deploying capital in a manner consistent with our investment thesis.  So in closing, we are off to a strong start, and our first quarter results demonstrate we are on track to deliver on our full fiscal year and multiyear financial goals. We're building momentum under VoLT, while focusing on key priorities that will accelerate our growth and -- our resiliency, both in the near and medium term.  Every day, watching our talented colleagues lead, win work, serve clients and manage this business with such skill and accuracy gives me great confidence. And it is because of them that we have the results we're able to discuss with you today.  With that, Lloyd, over to you to take us through the financials in depth. Sure. Why don't I start? As you said, well, we're very pleased with the growth of the entire portfolio in this quarter. It gives us the momentum and the operational resilience that we're looking for to navigate both this year and the multiyear financial envelope that we have created. And again, I mean, first quarter demonstrates both at the top and the bottom line that we are very much on track.  All three markets grew in the quarter pretty robustly and health was the standout in civil, but the entire civil business is growing quite well. Health has been a very solid, close to double-digit grower organically for now quite some time. And the drivers there are unique position in some of these accounts in terms of helping them drive the digital transformation of those businesses, which positions us against procurements, I think, in a very unique way. And we continue to capture both share and share of mind really in the minds of our clients as they look to transform those organizations.  But in addition to that, our -- what we call citizen services, which is everything around the Treasury IRS and that entire portfolio has now a very robust pipeline that is looking really good because, again, those agencies are looking for the same kinds of federal -- of digital transformation efforts that we are positioned against.  And then lastly, we are focusing the third leg of our civil stool around really issues of domestic resilience and climate change that I think that are clearly beginning to get significant traction.  So when you put it all together, going back to the notion of VoLT, we are focusing on the hypergrowth areas where we believe the greatest opportunities are going to be, and I think, again, first quarter demonstrates we're on track. Sure. Yes, as you point out, I think we're very much on track towards our targets there, and we are seeing really sequential almost month-over-month increasing momentum and increasing growth on our hiring. It continues to be a competitive labor market. We are getting in a lot of talent. We see pre-COVID levels of attrition. But overall, we're gaining ground because our value proposition continues to be very strong. The type of work we do, the way in which we do it and the suite of compensation and benefits that we offer our employees is very much competitive really everybody in the market, and differentiated really from most people in the market.  In terms of color, I would point you to a couple of things that have me excited. One is we've seen in the last few months, the return of a few senior leaders. So we had lost two others that we didn't want to lose who now are coming back perhaps after seeing whether the grass is greener on the other side. And I think that speaks well to our value proposition and the sustainability of that proposition through market changes.  And then the second thing that has me excited is our Chief Operating Officer, Kristine Martin Anderson, is driving an agenda that is really looking to improve the candidate experience but also shorten the cycle from when we need a person to when that person becomes billable. There's a number of things we can do to really get from need to revenue, if you will, faster, which is obviously good for us, but it's also good for the candidates. Nobody wants to start a job slowly. Everybody wants to hit the deck running. So I think all of that positions us well for the year and beyond. I'll just add one quick point, which is that our North Star financially is EBITDA dollar growth. And we're looking at a year where we're trying to deliver $950 million to $1 billion and then accelerate in future years to get to the ultimate goal of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And so as Lloyd points out, we are managing cost, we're managing the business and ultimately, we're keeping a close eye on margin. But ultimately, we want to grow EBITDA dollars, which really starts with organic revenue growth and everything else that we're doing. Cai, why don't I take that one. Thank you for asking that question. I'll start by saying this is important. As part of VoLT, being VoLT is around velocity. And it is the notion that the right acquisitions accelerate our ability to bring the right capabilities to our clients in our environment where our clients need to move faster and need us to help them move faster. And so we look at acquisitions including EverWatch through that lens. And we do believe, and strongly stand by the statement that EverWatch is not -- if the consummating that acquisition will not just be good for Booz Allen, it would actually be good for our clients. For sort of a further reading, I would point you to -- we filed our answer last Friday to the DOJ claim and I'm not a lawyer, so I'm just going to let you read that answer. I think it's very well done and it stands for . Thank you for that question. I would characterize our position as one of first mover advantage.

            "name": "Lloyd Howell",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter performance reflects our focus on growing the business profitably as we seek to grow adjusted EBITDA dollars by approximately 50% through fiscal year 2025. These results were supported by a top line that exceeded our expectations as we deliver on our goal to achieve industry-leading organic revenue growth. Our disciplined strategy across the business drove robust margins while we continue to optimize our balance sheet and create capital deployment opportunities that will deliver meaningful value to our shareholders.  Importantly, our approach is working, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering exceptional operational and financial performance, which keeps us on track to execute against our long-term financial objectives.  Let's now turn to our first quarter results on Slide 6. At the top line, total revenue increased 13.1% for the first quarter to $2.2 billion. Organic revenue grew approximately 8% to $2.1 billion, with approximately $103 million of inorganic contributions. Revenue excluding billable expenses also grew 9.9% year-over-year to $1.6 billion. These results highlight our ability to convert sustained demand for our services and solutions by efficiently hiring and deploying our growing talent base. And as expected, our billable expense mix is normalizing towards the midpoint of our 29% to 31% target range, which was primarily due to an increase in materials purchases this quarter.  At the market level, we are pleased with the momentum and growth across all of our markets. We believe that -- expertise and leading-edge capabilities will continue to support durability of demand and provides visibility into future growth prospects as we continue to shape and execute the right type of work aligned to the hypergrowth areas we want to compete in.  Revenue growth for the first quarter was led by our civil business, which grew approximately 28% year-over-year, approximately 12% of which was organic. This marks our second consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth. These results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which continues to yield exciting new wins. And with Liberty now fully integrated into our civil market, we are looking forward to further leveraging our combined capabilities, relationships and mission expertise to pursue additional opportunities and grow our market share.  In defense, revenue grew by approximately 5% over the prior year period, reflecting our second consecutive quarter of positive revenue growth as we continue to build momentum across the entire portfolio. Demand remained strong, and we continue to double down on our hiring efforts as we ramp up recent contract wins and quickly deploy talent towards capturing high-value opportunities.  Across defense, in all of our markets, we remain steadfast in positioning ourselves to be the leading digital solutions provider to the U.S. government, transforming the way they adopt and integrate new technologies. Horacio described our progress on National Cyber. We also continue to innovate the digital battle space to bring differentiated scaled solutions to the joint warfighting mission. We view each of these platforms as growth accelerators for our markets and look forward to updating you along their journey.  And similarly, within intel, we continue to see momentum build with revenue growing by approximately 8% over the prior year, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Despite a few larger awards shifting to the right, we remain energized by the pace and volume of award activity, including our pipeline of opportunities that we expect will provide exciting new growth prospects this fiscal year.  And lastly, in global commercial, which accounts for roughly 3% of our total portfolio, revenue grew by approximately 45%, of which 20% was organic.  Now on to Slide 7 for details on our demand signals. Net bookings for the first quarter were approximately $1.6 billion, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.72x and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.21x. This quarterly book-to-bill number reflects our ongoing expectations for choppiness in quarterly book-to-bill results as we pursue larger and more technically complex bids, which is why we continue to point to our strong trailing 12-month book-to-bill results as a better indicator of sustained demand.  Total backlog grew approximately 6.8% year-over-year to $28.6 billion. Funded backlog grew 15.1% to $4 billion. Unfunded backlog grew 10.7% to $10 billion. And price options grew 2.3% to $15 billion.  Looking ahead, with a budget in place and funding available, we have already seen the release of large awards and our RFP submission value and volume are both up over the prior year. In addition, we continue to work in close collaboration with our clients who indicate their desire to issue awards before the government fiscal year end. With each of these integral parts in motion, we are optimistic in our ability to continue translating strong demand signals into top line growth.  Pivoting to headcount. As of June 30, we had approximately 29,300 employees, an increase of approximately 750 year-over-year or 2.6%, most of which was organic growth. Client staff headcount grew approximately 975 year-over-year or 3.8%. As Horacio emphasized, successful execution of our hiring strategy is a top operational priority in meeting the shifting needs of our business. Accordingly, we continue to be laser-focused on headcount growth and retaining our talent to keep pace with our plan, allowing us to deliver another year of mid-single-digit growth.  Moving to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA was $253 million in the first quarter, up 6.1% from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.2% is approximately 70 basis points lower than the same period a year ago. Margins benefited from strong profitable contract level performance and mix, which was more than offset by higher indirect costs, reflecting our growing talent base and increased salaries. In addition, higher unallowable spend and billable expense mix, both of which we forecasted will normalize as we return to prepandemic business patterns, weighed on the results in the quarter.  As we move through the duration of this fiscal year, we expect a similar seasonality to our margin performance, which factors into our expectation that our billable expense mix will remain near the midpoint of our 29% to 31% range while unallowable spend will pick up incrementally, both of which will weigh on margins.  First quarter net income increased 49.9% year-over-year to $138 million. Adjusted net income was $151 million, up 3.4% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share increased 53.7% to $1.03 from $0.67 in the prior year period. And adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5.6% to $1.13 from $1.07.  Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by higher interest and D&A expenses. These increases were partially offset by a lower share count due to share repurchases made in line with our disciplined capital deployment strategy.  Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $59 million, the result of cash used in operating activities of negative $46 million and capital expenditures of $14 million. Cash from operations was seasonally light as strong collections were offset by higher disbursements and onetime payroll items associated with administrative staffing changes completed last quarter and other businesses transactions.  Incremental to the quarter was approximately $50 million of collections that shifted into the second quarter due to system outages and corresponding payment delays at one of our primary government payment agencies, all of which has since been received. We ended the first quarter with a strong cash balance of nearly $500 million and a $1 billion untapped revolver.  Turning to Slide 8. During the first quarter, we returned $160 million of capital to shareholders, consisting of $58 million of share repurchases at an average share price of $83.50 and $59 million in quarterly cash dividends. Net debt at the end of the year was approximately $2.3 billion and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.4x, reflecting our strong balance sheet.  We continue to look for opportunities to optimize our capital structure as it will provide us the capacity to deliver against our capital deployment plans and create accretive long-term value for our shareholders.  Today, we are also pleased to announce that the Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share, payable on August 1 to stockholders of record on August 15, as well as an increase of $400 million to our share repurchase authorization, bringing our remaining available capacity to approximately $1 billion.  Turning to guidance. Please move to Slide 9. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2023 guidance. As we discussed last quarter, the first half, second half dynamics we provided are still the guiding framework for our full fiscal year growth expectations. We expect revenue growth to be between 5% and 9%, inclusive of inorganic contributions. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the range of $950 million and $1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid- to high 10% range. We expect operating cash flow to be between $850 million and $950 million, which excludes our expectations for approximately $550 million of cash tax headwinds this fiscal year.  As detailed on Slide 10, let me break our cash taxes down into three components. First, approximately $200 million is associated with our forecasted pretax income and annual effective tax rate. Second, another approximately $200 million is associated with strategic planning initiatives undertaken in prior fiscal years. We expect to receive tax refunds in future years related to the strategic tax planning initiatives. And third, the remaining approximately $150 million is associated with Section 174. While we believe that it could be deferred or repealed, we are basing our assumptions on the prevailing legislation.  Taken together, for fiscal year 2023, $350 million of cash tax payments are associated with timing or onetime headwinds that we do not expect to repeat, barring future tax planning initiatives that we may execute. We will start making cash tax payments against these items starting in our second fiscal quarter, but expect our operating cash flow performance will still follow a normal cadence to previous years.  As shown on Slide 11, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $4.15 and $4.45 based on an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% and $131 million to $133 million average weighted shares outstanding. If our share price keeps pace with the performance of the most recent quarter, we expect the reduction in share count will net near the high end of our guided range. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to remain in the range of $90 million to $110 million as we continue to meaningfully invest in our infrastructure and technology.  In closing, I'll reiterate that we are very pleased with our first quarter performance. Booz Allen continues to be on a solid path to execute on our long-term objectives of delivering strong organic growth and driving superior shareholder value. Our management team is excited about the momentum we have already generated to meet our multiyear financial goals.  With that, Nathan, let's open the line for questions. Sheila, this is Lloyd. The only thing I would add to your Liberty question, it really has been a strategic accelerator. As we said previously, that's our strategy when it comes to M&A. And financially, we saw $92 million from Liberty inorganically as a contribution. So it's really integrating well, and we're on pace to have a solid year. Yes, you got it right, Gavin. We're seeing between 23% and 25% going forward. And the $200 million associated with our strategic planning initiatives in prior years will come back to us. I can't tell you now exactly when it will come back to us, but it will, we expect, come back to us. Sure. Well, let's start with how happy I am with the fact that we're out of the gates with 11.2%. And it really is a reflection of continued solid contract performance. And quite frankly, as the business has opened up, we're seeing an -- spend and billable expense mix start to normalize in addition to that higher indirect spend.  We are in the early stages of investment, particularly around cyber platform, as you heard in our prepared remarks and digital battle space. So at this point, investment really is I would characterize it as organizing our leadership, recruiting the right leaders, things of that sort. I think where that will put us over the course of the year is how I've guided, which is mid- to high 10s. So we will exceed some more investment over the course of the year. But the guidance range that I provided so far is what I would use going forward.  And also just to close it out, it's also kind of back to our normalized pattern, where in the first half of the year, we do see higher margin performance. But in the second half of the year is where we typically invest in our people, infrastructure and technology. I'll start. I'm pleased with the fact that we feel we've got the right levers in terms of allocating capital, and for the benefit of our shareholders, the near, mid and long term. And with those levers, it gives us a great deal of flexibility to do that. This particular quarter, $58 million in repos, $59 million in quarterly dividend. And the fact that we've got a growing pipeline of strategic M&A opportunities really sets us up, I think, to deploy against what we've stated for the long-term objective.  Obviously, when we look at some of the M&A opportunities, we have to take into account the talent base and the cultural integration. And that comes even way before sort of what the financial implications are. But that goes hand in hand with how we think about our M&A opportunities. And so far, so good. In the case of Liberty, we had a really good experience there, and we're looking to replicate future deals along those lines. Cai, it's Lloyd. I'll start. What we have historically seen is our traditional quarterly book-to-bill pattern really starting to change in light of these larger procurements that can be awarded at any point in our fiscal year. So when you look at our Q1 of 0.72x, that's really a result of not having one of these larger procurement hit, as you saw in our Q4 of last fiscal year. That being said, we internally look at the trailing 12 months of 1.21x as a better indicator as to the demand signal, and we're seeing strong demand signals, particularly with our backlog up 6.7% as well as continued growth in that regard.  As to things shifting, with the exception of 1 or 2 contracts, we're not really seeing a lot of things shifting at this point in the year. And I would say that as we look towards next quarter, we're really seeing, as you point out, continuing to be a seasonally strong quarter for us, and we're already seeing larger awards being released, an uptick in RFPs and strong indications that our clients are going to move out before the end of the government fiscal year.  As to the large protests, it's approximately $1.1 billion in total. As you know, we are in an environment that is heavily protested. We are optimistic that the things that are under protest will ultimately will prevail. But it's sort of an environment, as you know, where it's heavily protested. Yes, it's pretty solid at this point. We, over the years, our tax planning strategies really created some positive tailwinds. And the IRS is looking at our amended returns and we expect that it's going to come back to us. It's just a timing matter. Our guidance for the year, 5% to 9% really took into account a number of elements that have yet to play out. Certainly, when we come up on the midterm elections, that could have an impact. Certainly, the next COVID variant in terms of the productivity of our workforce, the geopolitical conflicts that are going on. So we've got a little bit more uncertainty in the back half, but how we've tried to capture that is having a little bit wider guidance range for the year, 5% to 9%. As we get -- approach the second half, we'll have a little bit, I hope, clarity as to where things are going to break.  But again, to reiterate, Horacio's comment at the beginning, we're really building momentum certainly in this quarter. We're looking to do the same in the second quarter. And that will, we believe, help us sort of navigate the uncertainty in the back half of the year."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, there'll be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on slide two. With me today to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown in the disclaimer on slide three, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking and may relate to future events or our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results disclosed in our SEC filings and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly, any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release and slides. Numbers presented may be rounded and as such may vary slightly from those in our public disclosure. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on slide four.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before diving into the content of this earnings call, I would like to share some news regarding our Board of Directors. On May 21, Dr. Ralph Schrader, our Board Chair, informed the Board of his intention to not stand for re-election and to retire effective July 24, which is our Annual Stockholders Meeting. It is impossible to fully account for Ralph's contributions to Booz Allen, to our investors and our people, to the country and to so many of us personally. Earlier this spring, Ralph celebrated 50-years with Booz Allen. In a career that spanned many roles, including CEO and now Chair. His impact and his legacy will forever be ingrained in the fabric of our company, for guiding us and inspiring us as we chart the course for our continued success. Thank you, Ralph, for all you have done for Booz Allen. And on a personal note, for all you have taught me. Thank you. I am deeply honored and humbled to have been chosen by our Board of Directors to serve as Chair of our Board after Ralph's retirement. I look forward to serving our company as Chair and CEO, working closely with our newly appointed lead Independent Director, Mark Gaumond. In our new roles, Mark and I will continue Booz Allen's commitment to excellence and values that has been the hallmark of our company for the past 11 decades. And now, Matt and I are proud to share exceptional financial results for fiscal year 2024. The year that ended March 31, marks our best performance since Booz Allen went public. Revenue and earnings both increased more than 15%, nearly all organic. This outstanding performance builds on double-digit revenue growth in the prior fiscal year and solidifies our standing as an organic growth leader in the industry. Year-after-year, Booz Allen consistently delivers. This speaks to the relevance of our work, the soundness of our strategy and the trust our clients place in us. And most importantly, our results are a testament to Booz Allen's amazing team of more than 34,000 purpose-driven professionals. This morning, I will describe how our VoLT strategy is fueling our performance and positioning us for the future. I will also address potential market volatility in the near-term and share our operational priorities for the fiscal year. Matt will then give an in-depth look at our full fiscal year 2024 results and our guidance for fiscal year 2025. Let's begin with our strategy. Our team's consistent execution of VoLT has brought us to where we are today. Booz Allen is a 110 years young. We are operating at peak performance and are as vibrant as ever entering our 12th decade. Since our founding, this company has anticipated and led change for ourselves and for our clients. Today's change vector is embodied in VoLT, which stands for Velocity, Leadership and Technology. VoLT has put us at the center of the technology transformation taking place across the federal government. VoLT powers our long-term growth in two key ways. First, we have positioned ourselves at the center of missions of national importance; and second, we have become a leader in injecting cutting-edge technologies into these missions. Allow me to take the next few minutes to describe what it looks like for Booz Allen and for our clients. One example of these dynamics is our increasing role in the Indo-Pacific region. As I have discussed previously, Booz Allen is deeply committed to the Pacific and has supported U.S. national security priorities there for decades. We continue to support INDOPACOMs most pressing requirements, from accelerated readiness to mission systems. We do so by leveraging technologies such as cyber, 5G and artificial intelligence to deliver scaled solutions at mission speed. In the past six weeks, I have spent time in Japan and Hawaii. I have met with many senior U.S. and allied military and government leaders to reinforce our commitment to helping maintain peace and stability in the region. Booz Allen's presence in this vital area continues to grow as we invest in new capabilities, partnerships and talent to support a broadening set of missions. A second example of the power of VoLT is our support of the digital transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs. At the VA, we work closely with our clients to leverage technologies already proven in the private sector to enhance the care and service of our nation's veterans from reducing endemic homelessness to optimizing virtual care and clinical triage services. It has also allowed us to effectively scale our team and technology solutions to meet the unprecedented growth of PACT Act claims associated with veterans exposed to toxic substances. Within the 16 months following the passage of the PACT Act, the VA has processed over 1.5 million claims and awarded over $3.8 billion in payments to veterans. We helped the VA automate important review steps for a portion of these claims, shortening the process and overcoming what would have been a largely manual manpower intensive process. These examples, along with similar efforts across multiple Federal health agencies, have helped double the size of our health business in the last five years to roughly $2 billion in fiscal year \u201824. A third example of VoLt in Action is artificial intelligence. Before AI came into the public consciousness, Booz Allen anticipated and prepared for the moment we are in now. We invested ahead of the market in talent and capabilities to win early stage work and build a leading position. And so today, as AI becomes ubiquitous across the U.S. government, we are recognized as the leading provider of AI services to the federal government by Deltek's 2024 report. In FY \u201824, our AI revenue grew to nearly $600 million and we aspire to grow this business to over $1 billion in the next couple of years. As AI is increasingly integrated into more and more contracts, we will continue to invest in our AI talent base through VoLT hiring and upskilling. We are also partnering with a range of other technology firms to bring commercial dual-use tech to our clients faster. Without a doubt, Booz Allen is a team on-the-move. And VoLT is working as our accelerator. But beyond all the specific examples, the ultimate proof point of our VoLT strategy is our performance against the goals we set out in our investment thesis 2.5 years ago. As we begin the final year of our three-year trajectory, we are issuing guidance at the top-end of our original EBITDA target of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Over the three year period of the investment thesis, we will have grown our EBITDA by more than a third virtually all organic. Our organic outperformance gives us greater momentum, as well as balance sheet strength and operational resiliency. As we look to capture new opportunities in an increasingly challenging market. Looking at the coming months, we recognize the potential disruption, a contentious election and other societal and geopolitical factors may cause this fall. Collections can bring about uncertainty, particularly to the budget process. Despite this, there are two things of which we are certain. The clients we serve are focused on fulfilling their missions in service to our nation, and we are poised to support them every step of the way. As in prior years, our operating philosophy for FY \u201825 is to build momentum in the first-half of the fiscal year to mitigate any increasing volatility in the second-half. To do this, our operational priorities include the following: First, we must take full advantage of our record proposal pipeline, which includes a number of large new programs and recompetes. Second, we will continue to transform how we execute our existing business. We seek to increase the speed and precision with which we deliver key technologies into programs and to drive efficiency and effectiveness across all of our support functions. And third, we will continue to implement VoLT at full-speed, maximizing the value of our increased investments in people, market positions and new technologies. Our overarching goal for FY \u201825, is to further differentiate Booz Allen by demonstrating our unique ability to drive technology into mission outcomes faster and better than anyone else. In summary, while respectful of the inherent volatility in our environment, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. The Booz Allen team is market tested, and exceptional. I am in all of the incredible people I have the privilege to work with, of the impact they have on our clients and of the outstanding performance they create year after year. Their skill and passion are at the center of who we are as a company, and they are the reason for our continued success. And now, Matt, over to you to take us through our financial results and fiscal year 2025 guidance.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio. And good morning, everyone. I've spent a good deal of time recently thinking about Booz Allen's 110-year legacy of foresight, innovation, execution and transformation. Booze Allen is the ultimate compounder. Quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, we set goals and we deliver. Always driving forward each step building on the one before. This creates exceptional value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. In this spirit, we continued to build in the fourth quarter, delivering excellent results to complete an extraordinary fiscal year 2024. By almost any financial metric, this was the best fiscal year in our history. Our VoLT strategy is working. We enter fiscal year 2025 with significant strategic, operational, and financial momentum. Once again, we are positioned to deliver robust organic growth, strong earnings and free-cash flow and exceptional shareholder value. This morning, I will start by briefly touching on our fourth quarter highlights. Then delve deeper into our fiscal 2024 performance and finally cover our fiscal 2025 guidance. Please turn now to slide six. I am proud to say that we met or exceeded all of our objectives for the fourth quarter. We continue to build on many of the trends that Horacio and I have highlighted on recent calls. Positioning the company in areas of enduring national importance at the intersection of mission and technology, delivering remarkably consistent performance, operating efficiently, while investing in the future, and building momentum and resilience. To cover a few of the financial highlights for our fourth quarter, total revenue was approximately $2.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. All of this growth was organic. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $287 million, 24% over the prior year quarter. This translated to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. We generated $1.33 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 32% year-over-year. We added 364 net client staff and recorded a book-to-bill of 0.82 times, in line with our expectations. Finally, we returned $194 million of capital to investors through dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Thanks to the hard work of people across our company, we closed the fiscal year stronger-than-expected. For the full fiscal year, total revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $10.7 billion. This exceeded the top-end of our guidance, driven by strong demand, healthy hiring across our portfolio and higher than anticipated billable expenses in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue was up 14.5% year-over-year. And revenue excluding billable expenses increased 14.4%. Our revenue growth was broad based. Our defense business continued to accelerate. Revenue grew about 20% year-over-year with double-digit growth across most portions of the defense portfolio. Performance in our civil business was also excellent, up roughly 18% from last fiscal year. Our civil sector has now reported nine consecutive quarters of double-digit organic growth. Our intelligence business is on a strong vector for the future. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. We are pleased with both the supply side and demand-side momentum in this business. And finally, our global commercial business, which represented 2% of revenue in the fiscal year was down 25% year-over-year, reflecting previously disclosed divestitures. Given its small relative size, going forward, we will not report our commercial results separately. Moving to the demand picture on slide seven. We ended fiscal year 2024 with net bookings of $13.3 billion and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.25 times. Total backlog as of March 31 was $33.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 qualified pipeline is robust, standing at $63.8 billion or 38% higher than a year ago. This includes a number of exciting opportunities across the portfolio as well as some accelerated recompetes in our civil and defense businesses. With federal funding in place through September, we are working to aggressively capture and start as much work as possible in advance of the upcoming election and the new government fiscal year. In short, we have the backlog, pipeline and market momentum necessary to drive future growth. Turning now to the supply side, as Horacio noted, we closed the fiscal year with more than 34,000 employees. Our client staff headcount increased 7.4% year-over-year, setting us up well for fiscal year 2025. Total headcount was up 7.2%. Our relentless focus on culture and the employee experience at Booz Allen continues to pay dividends, not just in our consistent headcount growth, but also in our low attrition and strong referral and application numbers. Moving now to the bottom line, we earned $1.175 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year. This is 16% higher than in fiscal year 2023 and at the top end of our updated guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations. This profit growth was generated by our excellent top line growth, strong contract level performance, and a disciplined approach to operations and investment. Our leaders continue to manage the business very well. This has allowed us to do three things simultaneously. Increased investment in the talent, technologies, and partnerships needed to solve emerging mission challenges, transform key corporate functions and continue to get scale in our operations. Working down the P&L, our net income was $606 million, 123% higher year-over-year. Adjusted net income increased 19% year-over-year to $719 million. Diluted earnings per share grew to $4.59 per share, up 126% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21% year-over-year to $5.50. These results include significantly higher interest expense for the fiscal year, which was offset in part by a lower than anticipated 8 times tax-rate in the fourth quarter. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the fiscal year with $554 million of cash on hand, net debt of $2.86 billion, and a net leverage ratio of 2.4 times adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. We have ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital deployment strategy. Free cash flow for the fiscal year was $192 million, the result of $259 million of cash from operating activities, less $67 million of CapEx. Note that this CapEx excludes $16 million of accrued expenditures that were paid in early fiscal year 2025. From a free cash flow perspective, this was offset by an unanticipated $13 million cash tax outlay, related to contested DC tax assessments, which is further described in our 10-K. Collections were strong for the fiscal year and cash outflows remained consistent with our outsized growth and ongoing investments in our business. Excluding one-time events, cash performance improved in fiscal year 2024, and this will remain an area of focus going forward. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. In fiscal year 2024, we returned $668 million of capital to shareholders. This included $415 million in share repurchases at an average price of $116.81 per share. As well as $253 million in quarterly cash dividends. Additionally, we made $23 million of strategic investments through our Corporate Venture Capital program. While we completed no acquisitions last fiscal year, strategic acquisitions are still an important part of our capital deployment strategy, as we focus on bringing technology to mission at speed and scale. We are pursuing a healthy pipeline of small to mid-sized tuck-ins. As a firm, we remain committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value through efficient capital allocation. Finally, I'll note that our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which will be payable on June 28, to stockholders of record as of June 13. The Board also approved an increase of $525 million to our share repurchase authorization, bringing our available capacity to $1 billion as of March 31. I will now take you through our fiscal year 2025 guidance. Please turn to slide nine. Given how our fiscal year aligns with government funding cycles, we typically plan for a strong first-half and a more uncertain second-half. We are doing the same this fiscal year. We entered this fiscal year with significant momentum, but anticipate continued uncertainty from societal and geopolitical conflicts, the upcoming election and possible disagreements about the next budget cycle. In this environment, we are focused on controlling what we can control. We are positioning our business for continued growth to keep driving forward and to keep compounding. Let's now walk through our fiscal year 2025 guidance. At the top line, we expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 11%. This range takes into account several variables, including the extent to which we win and start work, the potential for drawn out federal budget negotiations, and the timing and pace of headcount gains. We are again targeting mid-single-digit headcount growth for the fiscal year. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA dollars in the range of $1.26 billion to $1.3 billion. As Horacio noted, this is the high-end of our investment thesis range. We expect to achieve this almost entirely through organic performance, creating significant balance sheet capacity for the future. The implied full fiscal year adjusted EBITDA margin is about 11% on par with fiscal year 2024. We expect ADEPS of between $5.80 and $6.05 per share. This assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of between 23% and 25%, an increase from the prior fiscal year. As well as a marginally higher interest expense in the range of $180 million to $190 million. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of between $825 million and $925 million and free cash flow of between $725 million and $825 million. This assumes CapEx spend of around $100 million, including the previously mentioned accrued expenditure that shifted from the fiscal fourth quarter and was paid in early fiscal year 2025. In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the outstanding year we just delivered. The momentum we built translates into a strong guide for fiscal year 2025, and a great finish to our three year investment thesis. Our VoLT strategy is working, and we continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders. This is a real testament to our people and the enduring power of Booz Allen. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: j Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning, everyone. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Mariana.\nMariana Perez Mora: So my first question is about this recent memo on AI, that the White administration put forward, and the memo mandates that each agency will have to appoint a Chief AI Officer. Have you seen any of those like that increased demand come through? Or how are you thinking about opportunities as these new officers actually think about their AI strategy use case and all those things?\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, Mariana, thank you for the question. Here's how I think about it. AI is becoming an integral part of how the federal government operates. We are seeing it more and more over the last couple of years. You've heard me talk about things move from demonstration projects to prototypes. We're now entering the scale phase. And so it makes sense that governing AI, correcting these agencies that managing the resources and the investments against it to be done and it makes sense that in some of these agencies, there's already Chief Data and AI Officers, and they're making a difference and Booz Allen has been poised to take advantage of this growth in AI now for several years. I think we've been talking about this from before it became popular and our business is growing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are looking at a roughly $600 million business now. We are thinking that business alone will reach a $1 billion in a couple of years. But more importantly, we are seeing AI become a differentiator across a lot of our procurements. And the fact that we have a leading position that is recognized externally that we're doing work that our clients see as nobody else being able to do, I think, opens doors on opportunities for Booz Allen that we're very excited about. And as we look forward, we really think that AI is really AI, and it's AI and cyber, where we also have a leading position. It's AI and space, where we're making significant inroads. It's AI and zero trust, AI and communications. And so I think Booz Allen's ability to continue to expand and grow as a result of that and to be differentiated is only going to increase in the years to come.\nMariana Perez Mora: Thank you. So you mentioned AI as a differentiator. Could you please also give us some details or color around these like contracts that you have for recompete? What is the recompete risk and how you think these skills position you towards like having a stronger P win?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. Let me frame this conversation in a couple of ways. The first one is, we're coming off our best year ever, right? And we're entering our FY '25 year with a lot of momentum, VoLT, our strategy is working and we -- the V involved is for Velocity and we are faster than ever before. We're strategically really well-positioned. And as we said earlier, while we recognize the uncertainties that an election year can bring, we are guiding to the top-end of our investment thesis and we're entering this year with momentum and with resiliency both in our balance sheet, in our portfolio and everything else. Recompetes are a part of our business. The reality of the businesses, if you look at it over the last five or 10-years, we've gone from almost no $1 billion contracts to now a significant portfolio of $1 billion-plus contracts. And it is a five-year contracts, 20% of those on average will get recompeted every year. This year, there's a little concentration of that in our health business and a little bit in our defense business. As I look at those, we are really well positioned by the quality of our delivery, by the uniqueness of our offerings and by the work that we do. And this is all wrapped inside of a pipeline that is a record pipeline of close to $64 billion of opportunity. So we're looking at the year with optimism. We're very focused -- laser-focused on winning our recompetes, but also capturing new work and taking advantage of the fact that a number of these recompetes come with increased scope and increased ceiling, which also presents new opportunity.\nMariana Perez Mora: Thank you so much and congratulations on the appointment and congratulations to Ralph in retirement.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: I had a couple of questions for you, but wanted to start, Matt, with you on the growth. You've talked about hitting high-single-digit organic growth and about 3% to 5% headcount growth for the full-year and a book-to-bill around 1.2% to 1.3% in order to hit that high-single-digit organic growth. Now you're guiding perhaps a little bit above that. You've already said that you anticipate mid-single-digit headcount growth this year. So what should we anticipate for book-to-bill? And then as a follow-up to that, are there any significant recompetes that you have coming up this year that we should be thinking about?\nMatt Calderone: Yes. Thanks, Rob. I'll take them in turn. Look, as Horacio said, we're entering the year with a lot of momentum, both on the supply side and the demand side. Starting the year on the supply side with headcount growth of about 7.4%, so above the mid-single-digit headcount target that we've talked about historically, which is part of the reason we're guiding to robust 8% to 11% organic growth. And then on the demand side, 1.25 times, which is sort of right in-line with where we want to be. To give you a feel for how we anticipate the year is going to play out, we do expect our quarterly growth profile on a year-over-year basis to be strong, but maybe even a little more even than last year, primarily driven by some quarterly comps. You recall last year, we grew 16% in the first-half. And I think we'll see a similar pattern for margins where they're more stable than our historical patterns, similar to what we saw last year. It had a solid start to the year. I'm not going to call where we're going to end up on book-to-bill, but we've had a really good start, particularly on the demand side. It's -- it recompetes are part of that. But as Horacio said, we've got a really robust pipeline. It's up 38% from where we were at this point last year. So the fact that we're targeting mid-single-digit headcount growth for this year, which typically sets us up for next year and we've talked about the robustness of our backlog, our book-to-bill, and obviously our pipeline, I think gives you a feel for how we're thinking about growth over the medium term.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. And then, Horacio, just for you, high level and you did -- you talked a bit about AI in the prior question and throughout the call, but you've been at the forefront of things like AI, 5G, cyber all along. And when we think forward next five to 10-years, I'm curious in terms of the major growth trends where you want to be a leader, how should we think about things like quantum computing and post quantum encryption?\nHoracio Rozanski: I really so appreciate that question, Rob. I mean, I think part of the reason we are sitting here feeling so good about the business is because over the last decade, we've invested on a number of things and we missed a couple, hit a few singles, but also hit a few home runs. And that's our continued approach, we're trying to be in front of the market. Things that we think a lot about now is the intersection of AI and cyber, and AI and Zero Trust. We think a lot about Edge, both Edge cloud, Edge computing and how you bring together AI at the Edge, which is actually a very significant technical challenge and that's why we have made investments through our Venture fund that position us really well on that. That's why we are building unique technology stacks with some of our technology partners that position us really well on that. And then as you said, I mean, I think we already have a budding leadership position in quantum and PQE. I think those are all going to be fields that are going to continue to grow. And I believe Booz Allen is continuing to build, because I think our mantra is, let's focus on these missions of natural importance, let's make sure we can bring our technology to these missions and let's make sure we can help our clients create solutions that scale beyond the prototype. I think this sort of focus on the prototype as the end of be all, short changes what our clients ultimately need and that's why we're so focused on scaling.\nRobert Spingarn: Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Yes, thank you, and good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nBert Subin: Horacio, I just wanted to follow-up to some of your AI comments to Mariana's question, and just in your prepared remarks. So when you hosted your AI and event, I guess around AUSA last year, you were looking for FY '24, sales in the range of, I think, $500 million to $700 million. It sounds like you came in around the midpoint of that based on what you noted. You also, however, said in your prepared remarks, you\u2019re looking to get to $1 billion in the next couple of years. So that would imply pretty significant growth. So I guess my question is, what's changing in AI in FY '25 and '26, for you to see that acceleration in growth? Is that a function of awards taking time, or is it a function of shifting internal investment to the contract side? And is that growth more skewed to the DoD Intel opportunity or has it been more civil driven?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's a really good question. I think this is where AI is in the cycle in the federal government. I think we -- there's a cycle of experimentation, there is a cycle of trying things out, then you start to get early successes. And then you go vertical on scaling. And I think we're just at the very beginning of the vertical scaling phase. The rationale there is, these missions are becoming increasingly complex. We talk a lot about the Pacific and the pacing threat. The -- that set of missions poses a whole new set of challenges to our nation just out of sheer scope. If you think about sort of half of the world surface or something like that is the INDOPACOM region. And so when you start to look at that, you understand how important it is to actually augment humans through artificial intelligence, our clients understand that and they're coming to us for work, for help, for support as they scale these capabilities. But it is really broad-based, if you'd asked me this question 18-months ago, I would have said, it was most prominent in Intel. DoD was starting to go down that path, and the civil agencies were really more focused on cloud migration than on AI. I think that has really changed. I think right now, everybody is taking advantage of the data on the cloud in particular to drive AI into their missions. And we're well positioned to help across the board, as I said, and to integrate it into other technologies that are -- that are key to that. And I think part of -- for us, part of what's really powerful is why we will -- while we're highlighting AI a little bit of its own because there's so much interest on it, everything we do is integrated. So it's always AI and cloud, AI and cyber, AI and space, AI and C2. And that's I think where the power is going to come on is, AI is not a standalone thing that you buy by itself. AI is an ingredient in accelerating emission need.\nBert Subin: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Matt, I have a follow-up for you. You're assuming flattish margins in FY \u201825. I guess as you think longer-term, putting everything into this from your AI growth, cyber growth, potentially faster growth in the civil sector. What would it take for Booz to go from an 11% margin to a 12% margin?\nMatt Calderone: Yes, thanks. So it's a broad hypothetical question. First, let me start by saying, I'm really pleased with our margin profile over the past couple of years and where we're guiding. I mean, we've talked about how dynamic the market across you is talking about how much the market has changed with AI and other infusion technology in the market. And to be a compounder, right, to generate the kind of consistent organic growth we've generated, you've got to invest ahead of demand. So remember, in our original investment thesis, we were guiding to mid-10s margins, so that we've been able to invest at record levels and really transform our business and deliver 11% margins. Over the past couple of years, it really speaks volumes about the strength of our business. I think to answer your question, it's really threefold. Can we continue to get scale out of our business? How much do we need to invest or do we want to invest in order to continue to compound, but the inflection point probably will be around selling differently and our clients buying differently. Talked a lot about outcome based contracting. It's still in its early stages. We're seeing some experimentation in different parts of our market. We're experimenting ourself, but we're nowhere near being able to call that as having a material impact on our margins going forward. But I'm sure this will be quite the topic for our next investment thesis.\nBert Subin: Thanks very much, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: Good morning. I wanted to ask, maybe if you could talk a little bit more about Capital Deployment in the coming years since probably, maybe a little bit of excess cash on the balance sheet, $750 million, $800 million of cash after CapEx coming this year. I guess, how do you see the M&A environment right now? Are there deals and valuations that make sense? And if not, should we expect to share a pickup in share repurchases this year from the 400-ish last year?\nMatt Calderone: Yes, thanks. You're right, we're in a good spot that we've been able to hit the top end of our investment thesis almost entirely through organic performance leaves us a lot of room on the balance sheet to deploy. Yes, I'll start by saying our Capital Deployment priorities haven't changed. Strategic M&A is our preference, but our approach hasn't either, right? We're going to remain patient and disciplined. So we didn't make any acquisitions last year. We were posting a few transactions. I feel really, really good about our pipeline. There are more assets out in the market, including some high-quality ones. Interestingly, we're seeing I think a disproportionate number of carve-outs this year, which provides some opportunity, but some challenges as well. And I'm actually -- I'm really encouraged by what I see, but we're going to stay flexible. And I also appreciate that the board has increased our share repurchase authorization, which gives us the flexibility to return value in lots of different ways.\nSeth Seifman: Okay, excellent. And maybe as a follow-up, just more of a clarification about the outlook for the year. You talked about planning for the strong start and then maybe a little bit more uncertainty in the back half around the budget, but there's also the -- so that would lead you to think, okay, maybe growth is going to be faster in the first-half, but then you talk about the way that the comps aligned. So we should be expecting this kind of 9%, 10-ish percent growth through the year and you see that happening in the back-half as well even with some of the uncertainty that you're thinking about with regard to the budget and the election?\nMatt Calderone: Yes. I think that's roughly in-line with what we anticipate. Yeah, a flatter profile, both in terms of year-over-year growth percentage and margins over the course of the year.\nSeth Seifman: Great. Great. Okay. Well, thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nJack Wilson: Yes, good morning. This is Jack Wilson on for Toby Sommer. I know you've recently spoken about sort of how the workforce has evolved to be sort of far more technical than historically. Can you speak to sort of how the hiring trends are in terms of sort of what percentage of new hires come in with tactical scales and what are sort of what percent are upscale one tired?\nHoracio Rozanski: Why don't I start on this? I think in general, because we have become so much more of a firm that injects technology into missions of natural importance, our hiring has shifted to both the mission expertise around those specific missions like we do in the Pacific, but also a broad based technical workforce that we both upskill internally and we hire externally. I don't know that we have -- every year we increase the percentage of our technical workforce a little bit. I think the good important trend is our attrition is down significantly year-over-year. We attribute that to -- I think the market is a little less frothy than it was a couple of years ago. But frankly, more importantly, we have done a lot of investing and a lot of work internally on binding people to our culture, on giving them internal opportunities on training our workforce. We built an AI aware course. We thought it would take us a couple of years to train 10,000 people. It took us, whatever, a couple of quarters to do it order of magnitude. So we're feeling very, very good about our ability to retain, to train and to upscale our workforce. And I think what's also underneath that is this focus on missions of natural importance are really allowing us to bring in absolute top talent from across the country, from across all industries that want to work on these key national requirements.\nJack Wilson: Thank you for that color there. And then maybe as a follow-up, are there any other regions outside the INDOPACOM region that you're seeing sort of especially high levels of activity?\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, the world is right now active just about everywhere. We, as I've spoken to before, have significant presence in Europe and in support of our nations working there around EUCOM and Ukraine. We have a presence in CENTCOM. We have a very significant growing presence in INDOPACOM. But also even outside of DoD, if you look at, the nation is making significant investments in public health and Booz Allen is right in the middle of that. There is a lot of modernization of technical infrastructure really across the entirety of the federal government and we are extremely active on that and differentiated as I said before.\nJack Wilson: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, Horacio, one for you. If I think about your industry 10 to 15 years ago, it was kind of focused on GWAP, a threat that really was not as significant as what we're seeing today with China with digital transformation with AI, and we're thinking about the folks from Booz basically were experts, but basically they were more supplementing what the customer did as opposed to today, where it seems like the technology level of expertise that you're bringing and others is higher. And if I look around, your numbers have been great, but your peers are also putting up some pretty good numbers. Part of that obviously is the strong flow through of the hefty FY '23, budgets. But aren't we moving to a period where you think your industry in Booz and specific can kind of delink from kind of looking at what's the O&M budget, what's the R&D budget, what's the Intel budget? Because you're taking a bigger chunk of that budget and we're looking at maybe some secular upward shift in your total sector's growth?\nHoracio Rozanski: I -- let me speak about asset a little bit. I think if you look at it broadly and I think you were making this point really well, Cai, it -- if you go back when I started in this business, the vast majority of innovation was funded really in the government. You go back 50-years, right? I mean the space program was inventing things that the private sector would then adopt. If you go back to the birth of the Internet, right? I mean that was a DARPA program that this private sector adopted. If you look at the way things work now, the flow of innovation is really in the other direction. The funding for innovation that the private sector can provide now of, the outspends the government every year. And I think that's an American strength. I think that is actually fundamentally a good thing. And so in that context, I think your question makes a lot of logical sense. As the dual use technologies continue to grow, I think Booz Allen is particularly well positioned because we started early, because we have the right partnerships, because of the talent base that you described to take advantage of these secular trends over years. I think overall, the market has to be linked to the budget by definition. But as you well know, not every part of the budget grows at the same speed, not every part of the market grows at the same speed. And I think key to our success is not just being to take share in the places where we are, but also to be positioned against the fastest areas of growth in the market. And to the extent that we can continue to do that, we -- obviously on any given year, this is an election year, we need to be cognizant of potential turbulence, but in the medium and long-term, we're very optimistic.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thanks a lot.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Horacio and Matt. And congratulations to Ralph. A really great succession story. In terms of -- I wanted to first ask about your health business. You said it doubled to $2 billion and some work with the VA. What type of runway do you see in health going forward given the technology implementation you have? And are there recompete opportunities from other competitors with VA and PACT Act?\nHoracio Rozanski: So our health business is an extraordinary business that has -- it's a true success story if you go back, 10, 15, 20 years, it really was not a significant contributor to the portfolio. Now it's a real source of pride reaching $2 billion, doubling in five years and really demonstrating the Booz Allen proposition of bringing technology to these national priority missions. I think as we look forward into the coming years, the acceleration of the digital transformation of our entire public health infrastructure from the support of veterans in the VA to really the transmission of information across this very complex health system in our country, to the preparation and to be better prepared for the next health emergency if it arises, when it arises. Those are the emissions that we are centered around. That is the work that we're doing. And we expect that work overall to continue to grow. And it's competitively intense because it is very important work, it is really good work and it's work we excel at. As I said earlier with Mariana's questions, there's a concentration of recompetes in that business this year. It's in part the calendar, it's in part the fact that actually some of these long programs, we are doing so much work and it's so good work that we're actually going through the ceiling before the end of the period of performance and so they're getting recompeted a little early. I think the quality of our work, the new insights and the new technology we're bringing to it position us well for all of these recompetes. And here's yet another place where, it's almost like we all divide the work between new work and recompetes and that makes sense at sort of as a characterization, but so much because the government is bundling procurements, the -- these recompetes are both recompetes and new work all at the same time. There's increase in scope, there's increase in ceiling, there's new opportunity and you've followed us for a long-time. I think one of the things that we're really good at is when we win work, whether it's recompete with expanded scope, whether it's a new program, we are uniquely going to tactically sell into that so that a $1 billion of ceiling actually becomes $1 billion of work over the life of the contract, because we know how to find opportunities and make sure that our clients get full access.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you for that, Horacio. And then maybe just in terms of the other half of the portfolio in civil, can you talk about some of the drivers of growth there? And can you -- do you expect to see double-digits in fiscal '25?\nHoracio Rozanski: This is a -- we're actually excited about the entire portfolio and say, well, I'm glad you asked that question because we talk so much about our health business because it's such a success story. But the rest of the portfolio in our work in treasury continues to grow. We're doing again exciting work, whether it's fraud detection, whether it's bringing AI to some of these missions for efficiency and effectiveness, whether it is the underlying digital transformation of some of these agencies, and certainly the cyber protection of this entire.gov domain. These are areas where Booz Allen has leading positions and excels. And the other part of our portfolio that is also exciting and growing is our law enforcement portfolio with the federal agencies. We are seeing an opportunity there. We've been investing in some of those clients for a while and these investments are now taking hold and we expect to see good growth there too.\nMatt Calderone: And, Sheila just to go outside health. I mean if you look at the entirety of the portfolio, I would say, and, I think you agree with this, our growth is probably as broad based as it ever has been. I mean even in our Intel business, the fact that they were able to grow 5% this year with the loss of F2, this speaks to the underlying strength in the business. So it's a -- we're an interesting spot having just gone through with Christine, in the review of all of our sectors and the accounts that underlie them. There's just a lot of optimism and it's very broad-based.\nHoracio Rozanski: That's a really good point. I mean, our defense business grew 20% this year. I think the last time that our defense business grew 20%, it was maybe a fifth of its size. So it grew this year the entire size that it was that year. So we're for good reason feeling very good. And as I continue to say, we're cognizant of the fact that this is an election year that the budget situation going into the next govern fiscal year is something we all need to keep a close eye on and we are and that's why we're taking advantage of the momentum that we have.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Congratulations. Thank you.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nLouie DiPalma: Horacio, Matt and Nathan, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Hi, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: And Horacio, in your prepared remarks, when you discussed your outsized role in INDOPACOM and then on LinkedIn last month, you highlighted your recent trip to Okinawa, were you alluding to your role with the JADC2 development and your connected battlefield platform? And in February, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Kathleen Hicks, she was at an AI symposium and she indicated that for the first time, the DoD has attained a minimum viable level for JADC2 to counter China in the INDOPACOM. And I am under the impression that you're playing a major role there. So is that true? And are you deeply involved there?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah. Louis, what I can say is that our growth in INDOPACOM is robust, as I've said in these calls, I spent time in Taiwan, I spend time in Japan, I spent time -- fair amount of time in Hawaii. And the conversations with senior clients, from my perspective are all about speed. How can we accelerate bringing technology to the theater in support of the mission. JADC2 portfolio is obviously an important area of focus, a particular area of focus, the fact that you have to communicate across all these platforms, across all of these distances in what could be sort of challenged electromagnetic spectrum. Those are areas that we're thinking very deeply about and we're very, very involved in making investments. And so those are the kinds of things that we think about and more to come.\nLouie DiPalma: Yes, great. And for Matt, what would you attribute your hiring strength to? Have you been making tech investments to improve your recruiting and onboarding? And has anything structurally changed that's allowing you to grow and improve employee utilization above your historical pace? And has the generational like AI excitement been positive from a recruiting standpoint?\nMatt Calderone: Yes, it is. The answer to your question broadly is, yes, Louie. We've made a number of improvements, including using technology to really enhance and expedite the entire portion of the recruiting cycle. But remember, about one-third of our employees come from referrals, which just gives you a sense of the power of the employee value proposition, right. I think people are joining Booz Allen, not just because we're better able to find them and process them. They're joining Booz Allen because they want to be here. We're doing exciting work and we're offering them careers and pathways, particularly for our technical talent as well as our mission focused talent that really want to have an impact that they find meaningful. The only thing I challenge you on a bit is we're not seeing utilization above historic levels. I think our utilization is fine. But it's where it should be. So that's not -- that hasn't been a driver of growth. It really has been -- obviously, we've got to work to put people on and we're doing a better job of attracting and retaining the kind of talent that we want.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes. I mean, I'll add to that simply by saying, we're saying internally, we're 110-years young and we use that language specifically because it's a really vibrant environment inside Booz Allen right now. Our people feel it, people that are looking for a job are attracted to it. And the work that we're doing, the clients we're doing it for and the way in which we work with one another, I think are all talent magnets. And that's what gives us optimism for the future in an uncertain environment.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. Thanks everyone and Happy Memorial Day weekend.\nMatt Calderone: Hey, you as well.\nNathan Rutledge: You as well.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Horacio for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. As I was just saying, at Booz Allen, we are so proud of our history and equally excited about the future. We are working in our virtuous circle where our strategy drives our performance drives investment, which creates opportunity and opportunities simply attract great talent that begin the cycle. All over again. Just this week, we held our Brooz Allen Excellence Awards which is our internal effort to both highlight and celebrate the talent that we have and the incredible work that they do. And this was an opportunity to hear some amazing stories of how we're supporting our veterans, how we're helping our local communities, how we're closing major national security vulnerabilities, our efforts to protect American troops, and to stop cyber-attacks. We have a chance to reflect on how we help the country get through a global pandemic and how we're helping the country prepare for any future health emergency. For 110-years, Booz Allen has always supported our clients and our nations, and we highlight the fact that we do it with excellence. It's not just what we do. It's who we are. And every day, the people of this company continue to deliver excellence. We really do have the most amazing team and I am just so proud to work with them. Thank you, Booz Allen, for listening for all you do, and thank you all again for joining us this morning. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before diving into the content of this earnings call, I would like to share some news regarding our Board of Directors. On May 21, Dr. Ralph Schrader, our Board Chair, informed the Board of his intention to not stand for re-election and to retire effective July 24, which is our Annual Stockholders Meeting. It is impossible to fully account for Ralph's contributions to Booz Allen, to our investors and our people, to the country and to so many of us personally. Earlier this spring, Ralph celebrated 50-years with Booz Allen. In a career that spanned many roles, including CEO and now Chair. His impact and his legacy will forever be ingrained in the fabric of our company, for guiding us and inspiring us as we chart the course for our continued success. Thank you, Ralph, for all you have done for Booz Allen. And on a personal note, for all you have taught me. Thank you. I am deeply honored and humbled to have been chosen by our Board of Directors to serve as Chair of our Board after Ralph's retirement. I look forward to serving our company as Chair and CEO, working closely with our newly appointed lead Independent Director, Mark Gaumond. In our new roles, Mark and I will continue Booz Allen's commitment to excellence and values that has been the hallmark of our company for the past 11 decades. And now, Matt and I are proud to share exceptional financial results for fiscal year 2024. The year that ended March 31, marks our best performance since Booz Allen went public. Revenue and earnings both increased more than 15%, nearly all organic. This outstanding performance builds on double-digit revenue growth in the prior fiscal year and solidifies our standing as an organic growth leader in the industry. Year-after-year, Booz Allen consistently delivers. This speaks to the relevance of our work, the soundness of our strategy and the trust our clients place in us. And most importantly, our results are a testament to Booz Allen's amazing team of more than 34,000 purpose-driven professionals. This morning, I will describe how our VoLT strategy is fueling our performance and positioning us for the future. I will also address potential market volatility in the near-term and share our operational priorities for the fiscal year. Matt will then give an in-depth look at our full fiscal year 2024 results and our guidance for fiscal year 2025. Let's begin with our strategy. Our team's consistent execution of VoLT has brought us to where we are today. Booz Allen is a 110 years young. We are operating at peak performance and are as vibrant as ever entering our 12th decade. Since our founding, this company has anticipated and led change for ourselves and for our clients. Today's change vector is embodied in VoLT, which stands for Velocity, Leadership and Technology. VoLT has put us at the center of the technology transformation taking place across the federal government. VoLT powers our long-term growth in two key ways. First, we have positioned ourselves at the center of missions of national importance; and second, we have become a leader in injecting cutting-edge technologies into these missions. Allow me to take the next few minutes to describe what it looks like for Booz Allen and for our clients. One example of these dynamics is our increasing role in the Indo-Pacific region. As I have discussed previously, Booz Allen is deeply committed to the Pacific and has supported U.S. national security priorities there for decades. We continue to support INDOPACOMs most pressing requirements, from accelerated readiness to mission systems. We do so by leveraging technologies such as cyber, 5G and artificial intelligence to deliver scaled solutions at mission speed. In the past six weeks, I have spent time in Japan and Hawaii. I have met with many senior U.S. and allied military and government leaders to reinforce our commitment to helping maintain peace and stability in the region. Booz Allen's presence in this vital area continues to grow as we invest in new capabilities, partnerships and talent to support a broadening set of missions. A second example of the power of VoLT is our support of the digital transformation of the Department of Veterans Affairs. At the VA, we work closely with our clients to leverage technologies already proven in the private sector to enhance the care and service of our nation's veterans from reducing endemic homelessness to optimizing virtual care and clinical triage services. It has also allowed us to effectively scale our team and technology solutions to meet the unprecedented growth of PACT Act claims associated with veterans exposed to toxic substances. Within the 16 months following the passage of the PACT Act, the VA has processed over 1.5 million claims and awarded over $3.8 billion in payments to veterans. We helped the VA automate important review steps for a portion of these claims, shortening the process and overcoming what would have been a largely manual manpower intensive process. These examples, along with similar efforts across multiple Federal health agencies, have helped double the size of our health business in the last five years to roughly $2 billion in fiscal year \u201824. A third example of VoLt in Action is artificial intelligence. Before AI came into the public consciousness, Booz Allen anticipated and prepared for the moment we are in now. We invested ahead of the market in talent and capabilities to win early stage work and build a leading position. And so today, as AI becomes ubiquitous across the U.S. government, we are recognized as the leading provider of AI services to the federal government by Deltek's 2024 report. In FY \u201824, our AI revenue grew to nearly $600 million and we aspire to grow this business to over $1 billion in the next couple of years. As AI is increasingly integrated into more and more contracts, we will continue to invest in our AI talent base through VoLT hiring and upskilling. We are also partnering with a range of other technology firms to bring commercial dual-use tech to our clients faster. Without a doubt, Booz Allen is a team on-the-move. And VoLT is working as our accelerator. But beyond all the specific examples, the ultimate proof point of our VoLT strategy is our performance against the goals we set out in our investment thesis 2.5 years ago. As we begin the final year of our three-year trajectory, we are issuing guidance at the top-end of our original EBITDA target of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. Over the three year period of the investment thesis, we will have grown our EBITDA by more than a third virtually all organic. Our organic outperformance gives us greater momentum, as well as balance sheet strength and operational resiliency. As we look to capture new opportunities in an increasingly challenging market. Looking at the coming months, we recognize the potential disruption, a contentious election and other societal and geopolitical factors may cause this fall. Collections can bring about uncertainty, particularly to the budget process. Despite this, there are two things of which we are certain. The clients we serve are focused on fulfilling their missions in service to our nation, and we are poised to support them every step of the way. As in prior years, our operating philosophy for FY \u201825 is to build momentum in the first-half of the fiscal year to mitigate any increasing volatility in the second-half. To do this, our operational priorities include the following: First, we must take full advantage of our record proposal pipeline, which includes a number of large new programs and recompetes. Second, we will continue to transform how we execute our existing business. We seek to increase the speed and precision with which we deliver key technologies into programs and to drive efficiency and effectiveness across all of our support functions. And third, we will continue to implement VoLT at full-speed, maximizing the value of our increased investments in people, market positions and new technologies. Our overarching goal for FY \u201825, is to further differentiate Booz Allen by demonstrating our unique ability to drive technology into mission outcomes faster and better than anyone else. In summary, while respectful of the inherent volatility in our environment, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. The Booz Allen team is market tested, and exceptional. I am in all of the incredible people I have the privilege to work with, of the impact they have on our clients and of the outstanding performance they create year after year. Their skill and passion are at the center of who we are as a company, and they are the reason for our continued success. And now, Matt, over to you to take us through our financial results and fiscal year 2025 guidance. Good morning, Mariana. Well, Mariana, thank you for the question. Here's how I think about it. AI is becoming an integral part of how the federal government operates. We are seeing it more and more over the last couple of years. You've heard me talk about things move from demonstration projects to prototypes. We're now entering the scale phase. And so it makes sense that governing AI, correcting these agencies that managing the resources and the investments against it to be done and it makes sense that in some of these agencies, there's already Chief Data and AI Officers, and they're making a difference and Booz Allen has been poised to take advantage of this growth in AI now for several years. I think we've been talking about this from before it became popular and our business is growing. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are looking at a roughly $600 million business now. We are thinking that business alone will reach a $1 billion in a couple of years. But more importantly, we are seeing AI become a differentiator across a lot of our procurements. And the fact that we have a leading position that is recognized externally that we're doing work that our clients see as nobody else being able to do, I think, opens doors on opportunities for Booz Allen that we're very excited about. And as we look forward, we really think that AI is really AI, and it's AI and cyber, where we also have a leading position. It's AI and space, where we're making significant inroads. It's AI and zero trust, AI and communications. And so I think Booz Allen's ability to continue to expand and grow as a result of that and to be differentiated is only going to increase in the years to come. Sure. Let me frame this conversation in a couple of ways. The first one is, we're coming off our best year ever, right? And we're entering our FY '25 year with a lot of momentum, VoLT, our strategy is working and we -- the V involved is for Velocity and we are faster than ever before. We're strategically really well-positioned. And as we said earlier, while we recognize the uncertainties that an election year can bring, we are guiding to the top-end of our investment thesis and we're entering this year with momentum and with resiliency both in our balance sheet, in our portfolio and everything else. Recompetes are a part of our business. The reality of the businesses, if you look at it over the last five or 10-years, we've gone from almost no $1 billion contracts to now a significant portfolio of $1 billion-plus contracts. And it is a five-year contracts, 20% of those on average will get recompeted every year. This year, there's a little concentration of that in our health business and a little bit in our defense business. As I look at those, we are really well positioned by the quality of our delivery, by the uniqueness of our offerings and by the work that we do. And this is all wrapped inside of a pipeline that is a record pipeline of close to $64 billion of opportunity. So we're looking at the year with optimism. We're very focused -- laser-focused on winning our recompetes, but also capturing new work and taking advantage of the fact that a number of these recompetes come with increased scope and increased ceiling, which also presents new opportunity. Thank you so much. Good morning. I really so appreciate that question, Rob. I mean, I think part of the reason we are sitting here feeling so good about the business is because over the last decade, we've invested on a number of things and we missed a couple, hit a few singles, but also hit a few home runs. And that's our continued approach, we're trying to be in front of the market. Things that we think a lot about now is the intersection of AI and cyber, and AI and Zero Trust. We think a lot about Edge, both Edge cloud, Edge computing and how you bring together AI at the Edge, which is actually a very significant technical challenge and that's why we have made investments through our Venture fund that position us really well on that. That's why we are building unique technology stacks with some of our technology partners that position us really well on that. And then as you said, I mean, I think we already have a budding leadership position in quantum and PQE. I think those are all going to be fields that are going to continue to grow. And I believe Booz Allen is continuing to build, because I think our mantra is, let's focus on these missions of natural importance, let's make sure we can bring our technology to these missions and let's make sure we can help our clients create solutions that scale beyond the prototype. I think this sort of focus on the prototype as the end of be all, short changes what our clients ultimately need and that's why we're so focused on scaling. Sure. Good morning. It's a really good question. I think this is where AI is in the cycle in the federal government. I think we -- there's a cycle of experimentation, there is a cycle of trying things out, then you start to get early successes. And then you go vertical on scaling. And I think we're just at the very beginning of the vertical scaling phase. The rationale there is, these missions are becoming increasingly complex. We talk a lot about the Pacific and the pacing threat. The -- that set of missions poses a whole new set of challenges to our nation just out of sheer scope. If you think about sort of half of the world surface or something like that is the INDOPACOM region. And so when you start to look at that, you understand how important it is to actually augment humans through artificial intelligence, our clients understand that and they're coming to us for work, for help, for support as they scale these capabilities. But it is really broad-based, if you'd asked me this question 18-months ago, I would have said, it was most prominent in Intel. DoD was starting to go down that path, and the civil agencies were really more focused on cloud migration than on AI. I think that has really changed. I think right now, everybody is taking advantage of the data on the cloud in particular to drive AI into their missions. And we're well positioned to help across the board, as I said, and to integrate it into other technologies that are -- that are key to that. And I think part of -- for us, part of what's really powerful is why we will -- while we're highlighting AI a little bit of its own because there's so much interest on it, everything we do is integrated. So it's always AI and cloud, AI and cyber, AI and space, AI and C2. And that's I think where the power is going to come on is, AI is not a standalone thing that you buy by itself. AI is an ingredient in accelerating emission need. Good morning. Why don't I start on this? I think in general, because we have become so much more of a firm that injects technology into missions of natural importance, our hiring has shifted to both the mission expertise around those specific missions like we do in the Pacific, but also a broad based technical workforce that we both upskill internally and we hire externally. I don't know that we have -- every year we increase the percentage of our technical workforce a little bit. I think the good important trend is our attrition is down significantly year-over-year. We attribute that to -- I think the market is a little less frothy than it was a couple of years ago. But frankly, more importantly, we have done a lot of investing and a lot of work internally on binding people to our culture, on giving them internal opportunities on training our workforce. We built an AI aware course. We thought it would take us a couple of years to train 10,000 people. It took us, whatever, a couple of quarters to do it order of magnitude. So we're feeling very, very good about our ability to retain, to train and to upscale our workforce. And I think what's also underneath that is this focus on missions of natural importance are really allowing us to bring in absolute top talent from across the country, from across all industries that want to work on these key national requirements. Well, the world is right now active just about everywhere. We, as I've spoken to before, have significant presence in Europe and in support of our nations working there around EUCOM and Ukraine. We have a presence in CENTCOM. We have a very significant growing presence in INDOPACOM. But also even outside of DoD, if you look at, the nation is making significant investments in public health and Booz Allen is right in the middle of that. There is a lot of modernization of technical infrastructure really across the entirety of the federal government and we are extremely active on that and differentiated as I said before. I -- let me speak about asset a little bit. I think if you look at it broadly and I think you were making this point really well, Cai, it -- if you go back when I started in this business, the vast majority of innovation was funded really in the government. You go back 50-years, right? I mean the space program was inventing things that the private sector would then adopt. If you go back to the birth of the Internet, right? I mean that was a DARPA program that this private sector adopted. If you look at the way things work now, the flow of innovation is really in the other direction. The funding for innovation that the private sector can provide now of, the outspends the government every year. And I think that's an American strength. I think that is actually fundamentally a good thing. And so in that context, I think your question makes a lot of logical sense. As the dual use technologies continue to grow, I think Booz Allen is particularly well positioned because we started early, because we have the right partnerships, because of the talent base that you described to take advantage of these secular trends over years. I think overall, the market has to be linked to the budget by definition. But as you well know, not every part of the budget grows at the same speed, not every part of the market grows at the same speed. And I think key to our success is not just being to take share in the places where we are, but also to be positioned against the fastest areas of growth in the market. And to the extent that we can continue to do that, we -- obviously on any given year, this is an election year, we need to be cognizant of potential turbulence, but in the medium and long-term, we're very optimistic. Thank you. So our health business is an extraordinary business that has -- it's a true success story if you go back, 10, 15, 20 years, it really was not a significant contributor to the portfolio. Now it's a real source of pride reaching $2 billion, doubling in five years and really demonstrating the Booz Allen proposition of bringing technology to these national priority missions. I think as we look forward into the coming years, the acceleration of the digital transformation of our entire public health infrastructure from the support of veterans in the VA to really the transmission of information across this very complex health system in our country, to the preparation and to be better prepared for the next health emergency if it arises, when it arises. Those are the emissions that we are centered around. That is the work that we're doing. And we expect that work overall to continue to grow. And it's competitively intense because it is very important work, it is really good work and it's work we excel at. As I said earlier with Mariana's questions, there's a concentration of recompetes in that business this year. It's in part the calendar, it's in part the fact that actually some of these long programs, we are doing so much work and it's so good work that we're actually going through the ceiling before the end of the period of performance and so they're getting recompeted a little early. I think the quality of our work, the new insights and the new technology we're bringing to it position us well for all of these recompetes. And here's yet another place where, it's almost like we all divide the work between new work and recompetes and that makes sense at sort of as a characterization, but so much because the government is bundling procurements, the -- these recompetes are both recompetes and new work all at the same time. There's increase in scope, there's increase in ceiling, there's new opportunity and you've followed us for a long-time. I think one of the things that we're really good at is when we win work, whether it's recompete with expanded scope, whether it's a new program, we are uniquely going to tactically sell into that so that a $1 billion of ceiling actually becomes $1 billion of work over the life of the contract, because we know how to find opportunities and make sure that our clients get full access. This is a -- we're actually excited about the entire portfolio and say, well, I'm glad you asked that question because we talk so much about our health business because it's such a success story. But the rest of the portfolio in our work in treasury continues to grow. We're doing again exciting work, whether it's fraud detection, whether it's bringing AI to some of these missions for efficiency and effectiveness, whether it is the underlying digital transformation of some of these agencies, and certainly the cyber protection of this entire.gov domain. These are areas where Booz Allen has leading positions and excels. And the other part of our portfolio that is also exciting and growing is our law enforcement portfolio with the federal agencies. We are seeing an opportunity there. We've been investing in some of those clients for a while and these investments are now taking hold and we expect to see good growth there too. That's a really good point. I mean, our defense business grew 20% this year. I think the last time that our defense business grew 20%, it was maybe a fifth of its size. So it grew this year the entire size that it was that year. So we're for good reason feeling very good. And as I continue to say, we're cognizant of the fact that this is an election year that the budget situation going into the next govern fiscal year is something we all need to keep a close eye on and we are and that's why we're taking advantage of the momentum that we have. Thank you. Hey, good morning. Yeah. Louis, what I can say is that our growth in INDOPACOM is robust, as I've said in these calls, I spent time in Taiwan, I spend time in Japan, I spent time -- fair amount of time in Hawaii. And the conversations with senior clients, from my perspective are all about speed. How can we accelerate bringing technology to the theater in support of the mission. JADC2 portfolio is obviously an important area of focus, a particular area of focus, the fact that you have to communicate across all these platforms, across all of these distances in what could be sort of challenged electromagnetic spectrum. Those are areas that we're thinking very deeply about and we're very, very involved in making investments. And so those are the kinds of things that we think about and more to come. Yes. I mean, I'll add to that simply by saying, we're saying internally, we're 110-years young and we use that language specifically because it's a really vibrant environment inside Booz Allen right now. Our people feel it, people that are looking for a job are attracted to it. And the work that we're doing, the clients we're doing it for and the way in which we work with one another, I think are all talent magnets. And that's what gives us optimism for the future in an uncertain environment. Thank you. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. As I was just saying, at Booz Allen, we are so proud of our history and equally excited about the future. We are working in our virtuous circle where our strategy drives our performance drives investment, which creates opportunity and opportunities simply attract great talent that begin the cycle. All over again. Just this week, we held our Brooz Allen Excellence Awards which is our internal effort to both highlight and celebrate the talent that we have and the incredible work that they do. And this was an opportunity to hear some amazing stories of how we're supporting our veterans, how we're helping our local communities, how we're closing major national security vulnerabilities, our efforts to protect American troops, and to stop cyber-attacks. We have a chance to reflect on how we help the country get through a global pandemic and how we're helping the country prepare for any future health emergency. For 110-years, Booz Allen has always supported our clients and our nations, and we highlight the fact that we do it with excellence. It's not just what we do. It's who we are. And every day, the people of this company continue to deliver excellence. We really do have the most amazing team and I am just so proud to work with them. Thank you, Booz Allen, for listening for all you do, and thank you all again for joining us this morning. Have a great day."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio. And good morning, everyone. I've spent a good deal of time recently thinking about Booz Allen's 110-year legacy of foresight, innovation, execution and transformation. Booze Allen is the ultimate compounder. Quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, we set goals and we deliver. Always driving forward each step building on the one before. This creates exceptional value for our clients, our people and our shareholders. In this spirit, we continued to build in the fourth quarter, delivering excellent results to complete an extraordinary fiscal year 2024. By almost any financial metric, this was the best fiscal year in our history. Our VoLT strategy is working. We enter fiscal year 2025 with significant strategic, operational, and financial momentum. Once again, we are positioned to deliver robust organic growth, strong earnings and free-cash flow and exceptional shareholder value. This morning, I will start by briefly touching on our fourth quarter highlights. Then delve deeper into our fiscal 2024 performance and finally cover our fiscal 2025 guidance. Please turn now to slide six. I am proud to say that we met or exceeded all of our objectives for the fourth quarter. We continue to build on many of the trends that Horacio and I have highlighted on recent calls. Positioning the company in areas of enduring national importance at the intersection of mission and technology, delivering remarkably consistent performance, operating efficiently, while investing in the future, and building momentum and resilience. To cover a few of the financial highlights for our fourth quarter, total revenue was approximately $2.8 billion, up 14% year-over-year. All of this growth was organic. Adjusted EBITDA grew to $287 million, 24% over the prior year quarter. This translated to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.3%. We generated $1.33 in adjusted diluted earnings per share, up 32% year-over-year. We added 364 net client staff and recorded a book-to-bill of 0.82 times, in line with our expectations. Finally, we returned $194 million of capital to investors through dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Thanks to the hard work of people across our company, we closed the fiscal year stronger-than-expected. For the full fiscal year, total revenue grew 15% year-over-year to $10.7 billion. This exceeded the top-end of our guidance, driven by strong demand, healthy hiring across our portfolio and higher than anticipated billable expenses in the fourth quarter. Organic revenue was up 14.5% year-over-year. And revenue excluding billable expenses increased 14.4%. Our revenue growth was broad based. Our defense business continued to accelerate. Revenue grew about 20% year-over-year with double-digit growth across most portions of the defense portfolio. Performance in our civil business was also excellent, up roughly 18% from last fiscal year. Our civil sector has now reported nine consecutive quarters of double-digit organic growth. Our intelligence business is on a strong vector for the future. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations. We are pleased with both the supply side and demand-side momentum in this business. And finally, our global commercial business, which represented 2% of revenue in the fiscal year was down 25% year-over-year, reflecting previously disclosed divestitures. Given its small relative size, going forward, we will not report our commercial results separately. Moving to the demand picture on slide seven. We ended fiscal year 2024 with net bookings of $13.3 billion and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.25 times. Total backlog as of March 31 was $33.8 billion, up 8.4% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 qualified pipeline is robust, standing at $63.8 billion or 38% higher than a year ago. This includes a number of exciting opportunities across the portfolio as well as some accelerated recompetes in our civil and defense businesses. With federal funding in place through September, we are working to aggressively capture and start as much work as possible in advance of the upcoming election and the new government fiscal year. In short, we have the backlog, pipeline and market momentum necessary to drive future growth. Turning now to the supply side, as Horacio noted, we closed the fiscal year with more than 34,000 employees. Our client staff headcount increased 7.4% year-over-year, setting us up well for fiscal year 2025. Total headcount was up 7.2%. Our relentless focus on culture and the employee experience at Booz Allen continues to pay dividends, not just in our consistent headcount growth, but also in our low attrition and strong referral and application numbers. Moving now to the bottom line, we earned $1.175 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year. This is 16% higher than in fiscal year 2023 and at the top end of our updated guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11% was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations. This profit growth was generated by our excellent top line growth, strong contract level performance, and a disciplined approach to operations and investment. Our leaders continue to manage the business very well. This has allowed us to do three things simultaneously. Increased investment in the talent, technologies, and partnerships needed to solve emerging mission challenges, transform key corporate functions and continue to get scale in our operations. Working down the P&L, our net income was $606 million, 123% higher year-over-year. Adjusted net income increased 19% year-over-year to $719 million. Diluted earnings per share grew to $4.59 per share, up 126% year-over-year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 21% year-over-year to $5.50. These results include significantly higher interest expense for the fiscal year, which was offset in part by a lower than anticipated 8 times tax-rate in the fourth quarter. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the fiscal year with $554 million of cash on hand, net debt of $2.86 billion, and a net leverage ratio of 2.4 times adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. We have ample capacity to continue executing our disciplined capital deployment strategy. Free cash flow for the fiscal year was $192 million, the result of $259 million of cash from operating activities, less $67 million of CapEx. Note that this CapEx excludes $16 million of accrued expenditures that were paid in early fiscal year 2025. From a free cash flow perspective, this was offset by an unanticipated $13 million cash tax outlay, related to contested DC tax assessments, which is further described in our 10-K. Collections were strong for the fiscal year and cash outflows remained consistent with our outsized growth and ongoing investments in our business. Excluding one-time events, cash performance improved in fiscal year 2024, and this will remain an area of focus going forward. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. In fiscal year 2024, we returned $668 million of capital to shareholders. This included $415 million in share repurchases at an average price of $116.81 per share. As well as $253 million in quarterly cash dividends. Additionally, we made $23 million of strategic investments through our Corporate Venture Capital program. While we completed no acquisitions last fiscal year, strategic acquisitions are still an important part of our capital deployment strategy, as we focus on bringing technology to mission at speed and scale. We are pursuing a healthy pipeline of small to mid-sized tuck-ins. As a firm, we remain committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value through efficient capital allocation. Finally, I'll note that our board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, which will be payable on June 28, to stockholders of record as of June 13. The Board also approved an increase of $525 million to our share repurchase authorization, bringing our available capacity to $1 billion as of March 31. I will now take you through our fiscal year 2025 guidance. Please turn to slide nine. Given how our fiscal year aligns with government funding cycles, we typically plan for a strong first-half and a more uncertain second-half. We are doing the same this fiscal year. We entered this fiscal year with significant momentum, but anticipate continued uncertainty from societal and geopolitical conflicts, the upcoming election and possible disagreements about the next budget cycle. In this environment, we are focused on controlling what we can control. We are positioning our business for continued growth to keep driving forward and to keep compounding. Let's now walk through our fiscal year 2025 guidance. At the top line, we expect organic revenue growth of 8% to 11%. This range takes into account several variables, including the extent to which we win and start work, the potential for drawn out federal budget negotiations, and the timing and pace of headcount gains. We are again targeting mid-single-digit headcount growth for the fiscal year. We expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA dollars in the range of $1.26 billion to $1.3 billion. As Horacio noted, this is the high-end of our investment thesis range. We expect to achieve this almost entirely through organic performance, creating significant balance sheet capacity for the future. The implied full fiscal year adjusted EBITDA margin is about 11% on par with fiscal year 2024. We expect ADEPS of between $5.80 and $6.05 per share. This assumes an adjusted effective tax rate of between 23% and 25%, an increase from the prior fiscal year. As well as a marginally higher interest expense in the range of $180 million to $190 million. Lastly, we expect operating cash flow of between $825 million and $925 million and free cash flow of between $725 million and $825 million. This assumes CapEx spend of around $100 million, including the previously mentioned accrued expenditure that shifted from the fiscal fourth quarter and was paid in early fiscal year 2025. In closing, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the outstanding year we just delivered. The momentum we built translates into a strong guide for fiscal year 2025, and a great finish to our three year investment thesis. Our VoLT strategy is working, and we continue to deliver value to all of our stakeholders. This is a real testament to our people and the enduring power of Booz Allen. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Hi, Rob. Yes. Thanks, Rob. I'll take them in turn. Look, as Horacio said, we're entering the year with a lot of momentum, both on the supply side and the demand side. Starting the year on the supply side with headcount growth of about 7.4%, so above the mid-single-digit headcount target that we've talked about historically, which is part of the reason we're guiding to robust 8% to 11% organic growth. And then on the demand side, 1.25 times, which is sort of right in-line with where we want to be. To give you a feel for how we anticipate the year is going to play out, we do expect our quarterly growth profile on a year-over-year basis to be strong, but maybe even a little more even than last year, primarily driven by some quarterly comps. You recall last year, we grew 16% in the first-half. And I think we'll see a similar pattern for margins where they're more stable than our historical patterns, similar to what we saw last year. It had a solid start to the year. I'm not going to call where we're going to end up on book-to-bill, but we've had a really good start, particularly on the demand side. It's -- it recompetes are part of that. But as Horacio said, we've got a really robust pipeline. It's up 38% from where we were at this point last year. So the fact that we're targeting mid-single-digit headcount growth for this year, which typically sets us up for next year and we've talked about the robustness of our backlog, our book-to-bill, and obviously our pipeline, I think gives you a feel for how we're thinking about growth over the medium term. Yes, thanks. So it's a broad hypothetical question. First, let me start by saying, I'm really pleased with our margin profile over the past couple of years and where we're guiding. I mean, we've talked about how dynamic the market across you is talking about how much the market has changed with AI and other infusion technology in the market. And to be a compounder, right, to generate the kind of consistent organic growth we've generated, you've got to invest ahead of demand. So remember, in our original investment thesis, we were guiding to mid-10s margins, so that we've been able to invest at record levels and really transform our business and deliver 11% margins. Over the past couple of years, it really speaks volumes about the strength of our business. I think to answer your question, it's really threefold. Can we continue to get scale out of our business? How much do we need to invest or do we want to invest in order to continue to compound, but the inflection point probably will be around selling differently and our clients buying differently. Talked a lot about outcome based contracting. It's still in its early stages. We're seeing some experimentation in different parts of our market. We're experimenting ourself, but we're nowhere near being able to call that as having a material impact on our margins going forward. But I'm sure this will be quite the topic for our next investment thesis. Yes, thanks. You're right, we're in a good spot that we've been able to hit the top end of our investment thesis almost entirely through organic performance leaves us a lot of room on the balance sheet to deploy. Yes, I'll start by saying our Capital Deployment priorities haven't changed. Strategic M&A is our preference, but our approach hasn't either, right? We're going to remain patient and disciplined. So we didn't make any acquisitions last year. We were posting a few transactions. I feel really, really good about our pipeline. There are more assets out in the market, including some high-quality ones. Interestingly, we're seeing I think a disproportionate number of carve-outs this year, which provides some opportunity, but some challenges as well. And I'm actually -- I'm really encouraged by what I see, but we're going to stay flexible. And I also appreciate that the board has increased our share repurchase authorization, which gives us the flexibility to return value in lots of different ways. Yes. I think that's roughly in-line with what we anticipate. Yeah, a flatter profile, both in terms of year-over-year growth percentage and margins over the course of the year. And, Sheila just to go outside health. I mean if you look at the entirety of the portfolio, I would say, and, I think you agree with this, our growth is probably as broad based as it ever has been. I mean even in our Intel business, the fact that they were able to grow 5% this year with the loss of F2, this speaks to the underlying strength in the business. So it's a -- we're an interesting spot having just gone through with Christine, in the review of all of our sectors and the accounts that underlie them. There's just a lot of optimism and it's very broad-based. Hi, Louie. Yes, it is. The answer to your question broadly is, yes, Louie. We've made a number of improvements, including using technology to really enhance and expedite the entire portion of the recruiting cycle. But remember, about one-third of our employees come from referrals, which just gives you a sense of the power of the employee value proposition, right. I think people are joining Booz Allen, not just because we're better able to find them and process them. They're joining Booz Allen because they want to be here. We're doing exciting work and we're offering them careers and pathways, particularly for our technical talent as well as our mission focused talent that really want to have an impact that they find meaningful. The only thing I challenge you on a bit is we're not seeing utilization above historic levels. I think our utilization is fine. But it's where it should be. So that's not -- that hasn't been a driver of growth. It really has been -- obviously, we've got to work to put people on and we're doing a better job of attracting and retaining the kind of talent that we want. Hey, you as well."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We hope you had an opportunity to read the press release we issued earlier this morning.

Thank you for joining us. Matt and I are very excited to share excellent financial results with you today. Booz Allen's record-breaking fiscal year continues. Our best first half has now extended into our strongest three quarters of growth since our firm went public in 2010. I am so proud of our team. Thanks to their efforts, we have achieved the strategic and operational momentum we aim for under our VoLT strategy. Our financial performance has been remarkably consistent. This quarter, we continue to deliver industry-leading double-digit organic revenue growth. We remain ahead of pace on our multi-year investment thesis and again, expect to exceed our guidance for the fiscal year. Given the continuing uncertainty in the market, from ongoing budget debates, geopolitical conflicts and the upcoming election, our clear focus remains to accelerate momentum and increase resiliency across our institution. Matt will take you through the full details of the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on putting our continued success in the context of our VoLT strategy. Let me begin with a little historical context. 2024 is Booz Allen's 110th year. Since our earliest days, we have embraced continual transformation as an imperative for relevance in the market and long-term growth. From World War II to the Apollo missions to the advent of digital government, Booz Allen anticipated the next waves of change early and transformed to meet the needs of each moment. Our goal has always been to stay a step ahead of our clients' requirements and help them drive their own transformations. Our firm has outperformed the market for decades because of four primary differentiators. Our ability to anticipate and adapt. Our capacity to invest and innovate. Our position on critical national missions. And most important, most important, our exceptional talent. All these factors hold true today. The current iteration of our century-long transformation journey is called VoLT, which stands for Velocity, Leadership, and Technology. We have been implementing this program for the past 24 months. The strategic aims of VoLT are to get faster and elevate our client impact, which in turn accelerate our growth and drive exceptional shareholder value. Our third quarter results demonstrate a few important things about our strategic progress. First, we have built resilience and driven momentum into the business, even as the external environment remains dynamic and uncertain. Second, we have strengthened our leadership position in the market as we transform missions of national importance with emerging technologies. And third, we have gained speed and efficiency in how we operate and grow our workforce. In sum, our VoLT strategy is working. As examples, let's look at two key missions we are transforming and at the amazing people who do this work. First, China. The National Defense Strategy describes China as DoD's pacing challenge, and it outlines the top priorities to strengthen the U.S. deterrence mission. The sheer geographic scale of this mission, which encompasses nearly half of the Earth's surface, creates both urgency and unique complexity for our clients. Through years of investment in the right technologies, talent, and partnerships, we are more prepared than ever to help our clients translate urgency into speed at scale. Today, we have more than 600 employees in the Indo-Pacific region working across various aspects of this mission. We have also forward deployed our innovation ecosystem. This provides our clients with faster, more direct access to emerging technologies. Our client focus is on accelerated readiness, supporting allies and partners, and bringing AI and cyber to key mission priorities. While there is much work to do, we are already having impact. A relevant public example is our recent win of a small, but strategic contract to build a private 5G network for the United States Navy in Guam. This work will leverage our early investments and expertise in 5G, edge computing, and zero trust to support secure communications, operations, and logistics on the island. Finally, I'll note that our firm's focus on the pacing challenge is not limited to our growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. Leveraging our lessons from Ukraine and other conflicts, we are considering how to tailor our solutions across all of our sectors. And given the scale and complexity of the China mission, we are also engaging our network of technology partners to mount an all-of-nation approach. In short, we are deeply committed to helping our clients defend U.S. interests. Because this is a long-term priority for our nation, it will be a long-term priority for Booz Allen. Pivoting next to our health business. For more than a decade, Booz Allen has been at the heart of many federal healthcare transformations. For example, we have worked to modernize care and benefits delivery for our veterans, implement health reform, and accelerate how life-saving drugs are safely brought to market. Through the strength of our work across these and many other missions, the health portfolio has crossed the $2 billion annual revenue threshold. Today, building on that success, we are poised to help our country transform the future of public health. Our recent win of the Data Modernization Accelerator contract, or DMAC, at the Centers for Disease Control, is a tremendous opportunity to improve data interoperability across the public health ecosystem. Our years of innovating at the VA and our early investments in cloud, machine learning, generative AI, and cyber positioned us well to win this work. Now Booz Allen is playing an integral role in helping the CDC unlock the power of data at scale, so our country can better prepare for and respond to critical public health emergencies. I've just described a small sample of the work we do at the center of the missions that matter most. More broadly, we are leading the way in redefining intelligence collection, implementing zero trust, and preparing for a post-quantum world. We are also focused on accelerating U.S. space superiority by harnessing data to speed decision-making and mission outcomes. To that end, we recently made a venture investment in a company called Albedo to leverage their leading-edge imagery capabilities as new data collection sources for our clients. The strategic importance of all these missions, coupled with our outstanding execution, build resilience in our business, and our relentless implementation of VoLT drives our momentum. Today, we are exactly where we want to be as we live our purpose to empower people to change the world. Because more than anything, at our core, we are a company of purpose-driven professionals. People join Booz Allen because they have a passion for doing world-changing work. People stay at Booz Allen because we invest in them and provide unique opportunities to solve tough challenges inside essential missions. Simply put, our people catalyze the potential of Booz Allen. So, my final point in our success with VoLT connects to our record headcount growth over the past six quarters. This is the result of intentional and focused efforts of our recruiting and business leaders to transform our talent acquisition processes. We are hiring, onboarding, and moving our talent to the missions they are passionate about faster than at any time in our history. These process improvements, combined with our increased investment in talent, create the conditions to grow our headcount at speed. This is crucial to accelerating our overall growth, which allows us to continue to invest and outpace the market. It is incredibly gratifying to see how VoLT is fully woven into our business and evident in the results we share today. We recognize that the hiring market and other macroeconomic conditions have improved in recent months. Even in a strong market, our outperformance, headcount gains, and new opportunity capture are the outcome of the purposeful empowerment of our leaders to take action in alignment with our strategy. And with that, Matt, I'll turn the call over to you.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I will start by saying that I am incredibly proud of the financial performance we are reporting today.  Our third quarter results are further proof that our VoLT strategy is working and Booz Allen continues to build momentum. We are investing in cutting-edge technologies, hiring the right people, building critical partnerships, and winning work at scale. These strengths are the source of confidence and resilience in our business. As Horacio noted, we have now recorded the strongest first three quarters of a fiscal year since our IPO. Our performance has been remarkably consistent on the supply side, on the demand side, and in how we are operating the business. Based on this performance, we are ahead of pace against our three-year investment thesis, and we are especially pleased to raise our fiscal year 2024 guidance again today. Now let's dive into the details. Please turn to slide six. Total revenue for the quarter grew 12.9% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Organic revenue was up 12.8% year-over-year, and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 13% year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. This exceptional top-line performance was fueled by our strategic position in the market, robust demand for our services and solutions, and our ability to attract and retain elite talent. Taking it now sector by sector, our defense business continues to excel. Revenue was up roughly 17% compared to the third quarter of the last fiscal year. And this performance is strong and broad-based. Our team remains focused on accelerating access to data and decision-making tools and providing next-generation solutions to warfighters on critical missions across the globe. Our civil business is also growing fast, up roughly 18% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the portfolio. Booz Allen is unleashing the power of data to achieve better and faster mission outcomes for our civil government clients, from health and life sciences to infrastructure and climate. As anticipated, the pace of growth in our intelligence business slowed in the third quarter. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year. Our Intel leaders are winning exciting new work in key mission areas and have had success retaining critical talent, people who can now support cyber missions across the firm. This business is on a strong vector for the future. Finally, our global commercial business, which represented 2% of revenue in the quarter, was down about 22% year-over-year. This reflects divestitures disclosed last fiscal year and overall softness in the commercial cyber consulting market. Moving on to bookings on slide seven. The award environment is strong and our market leaders are doing an outstanding job shaping and winning work consistent with our VoLT strategy. Despite uncertainty about the near and long-term budget environment, our government clients and the people of Booz Allen remain laser-focused on meeting the country's urgent mission needs. This quarter, net bookings totaled nearly $1.9 billion. Our third quarter book-to-bill was 0.72 times, our best third quarter book-to-bill since fiscal year 2018. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.41 times, well above our trailing five-year average. Total backlog as of December 31st stands at $34.3 billion, up 14.2% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 15.4% to $5.2 billion. Unfunded backlog declined 9.2% to $9.2 billion. And priced options were up 29.3% to $19.9 billion. In sum, demand is strong. We have a solid foundation to remain the industry's organic growth leader. Turning now to headcount. Booz Allen closed out calendar year 2023 with nearly 34,000 people. Total headcount is up 8.6% year-over-year, and client staff headcount is up 9.2%. We efficiently deploy our people on contracts and ensure they are empowered to succeed. This people-centric culture, including continuous investments in our employees, furthers their commitment to Booz Allen and in turn makes them ambassadors to future talent. Since the start of the fiscal year, client staff has increased more than 6%, exceeding our expectations as well as the 3% to 5% target we had set for the year. This level of client staff growth, combined with our healthy bookings, positions us well for the next fiscal year. Moving now to the bottom line. We earned $291 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. This is 19.1% higher than the third quarter last fiscal year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3% is roughly 60 basis points higher than for the same period a year ago. As you may recall, we manage the business on an annual basis. We indicated last quarter that we anticipated a somewhat flatter quarterly margin profile than in recent years. This pattern played out as we expected in the third quarter. Booz Allen pursues complex work that sits at the center of our client's mission and at the top of the technical stack. This requires us to invest ahead of the market. The quality of our work, coupled with our ability to get scale out of the business even as we ramp up investment, allows us to consistently deliver superior financial results. Third quarter net income was $146 million. The year-over-year increase of 374.6% in net income is primarily a result of the legal reserve of $124 million recorded in the third quarter of last fiscal year. This is partially offset by an increase in our provision for income taxes associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position related to Section 174. Adjusted net income increased 29.4% year-over-year to $184 million. This excludes the impact of the legal reserve and the increase in our provision for income taxes. Due to the same factors, diluted earnings per share grew 382.6% year-over-year to $1.11, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31.8% year-over-year to $1.41. Moving now to the balance sheet. We entered the third quarter with $602 million of cash on hand. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million, the result of $234 million of cash from operating activities plus $23 million of CapEx. Collections were strong for the quarter and included some payments we expected to receive in the fourth quarter. Cash outflows remained consistent with our outsized growth and sizable investments in our people and capabilities. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.8 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. We returned close to $156 million of capital to shareholders in the third quarter. This included approximately $94 million in share of purchases at an average price of $123.52 per share and $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Today I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a $0.04 increase to our quarterly cash dividend. This dividend of $0.51 per share will be payable on March 1st to stockholders of record as of February 12th. Now for a look ahead. On our last call, we updated our full year guidance to incorporate both the momentum we had built and the strong possibility of a two to 4-week government shutdown. Our revised guidance reflects the strength of our third quarter and the continued momentum of the business. While there is still uncertainty about government funding, we now believe that a multi-week government shutdown is significantly less likely to occur in our current fiscal year. Thus, we are no longer including a material shutdown related contingency in our guidance. Let me now take you through our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance. Please turn to slide nine. At the top line, we now expect revenue growth of 14% to 15%, 13% to 14% of which will be organic. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $1.155 billion and $1.175 billion, which equates to approximately 14% to 16% growth year-over-year. This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 11%. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $5.25 to $5.40 per share. This is driven by the increase in EBITDA and a modest decrease in our ADEPS tax rate, which we now expect to be between 22% to 23%. We are raising our guidance for net cash provided by operating activities to be between $200 million and $275 million. This range includes a roughly $25 million increase in our estimated fiscal year 2024 cash taxes related to Section 174. And finally, we still expect CapEx of roughly $85 million, and we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $115 million to $190 million. In closing, our business is performing exceptionally well. We have just delivered the best three quarters since Booz Allen's IPO, with remarkably consistent performance, even in the midst of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. This is a real testament to the quality of our leadership and the power of our VoLT strategy. Our firm is on a sustainable, quality growth path. The energy at Booz Allen is palpable. Our people are excited about the work they do, the impact they have, the strong performance we have delivered, and the many opportunities that lie ahead. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Good morning, Horacio and Matt. Phenomenal quarter.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Sheila. Thank you.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Really amazing. Just wanted to maybe think about the growth trajectory in terms of my question, starting with civil. Double-digit growth for eight quarters now. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what's driving that? And then how much of that is related to public health and the T4NG program, and what Booz is doing in the next phase of that program?\nHoracio Rozanski: Sheila, I'll take that one. And great headline, by the way. But let me start by maybe framing the whole performance, and then I'll be happy to go down into civil. At the firm-wide level, these have been the best three quarters, and we're on track for the best fiscal year since going public in 2010. And frankly, I go back further than that, and this is as good as I've ever seen. And the performance has been remarkably consistent. And if anything, we've been positively surprised by the strength of our talent acquisition and retention program, which really, as you know, fuels our revenue expillables [ph], which is the most important part. It does feel like, as an organic growth leader, we're in this virtual circle of excellent work allowing us to capture exceptional talent, which deliver great results for our clients, which deliver great results for our shareholders, which allow us to invest in the next wave of technologies, and so on and so forth. So in short, VoLT, which is our commitment to strategy, is working. And we are creating resilience and momentum in the business, even as we see the reality of an uncertain budget and funding and political season ahead of us. And so really, at the firm-wide -- so let me talk about civil, and I'll come back. Our civil business has been a star in our portfolio for, as you said, multiple years. In the early years of that amazing run, it really was driven around public health and some specific agencies in there. But really, as we look at the business now, we are a leader in digital transformation. We're a leader in cyber and in AI, and that is broad-based across the entire portfolio. So while, as I said, our health business now has crossed the $2 billion mark, and is certainly the larger part of this business, all elements from citizen services to law enforcement, it's all really working together or humming together to produce the results that you see. And you didn't ask, but the same is true in defense. And we really see real momentum and growth opportunity also building in our national security business. So, I guess maybe to close out a little bit and bring it all together, 110 years young is Booz Allen. This business is as vibrant today as it's ever been.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you for that, and I knew you'd like the title. In terms of just another one for you, somewhat related to the top line, but where your margins are pushing ahead of your long-term targets, essentially, and there's been a lot of discussions about the government contracting differently. So, do you think the government is paying a premium for Booz just given the service offering?\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes and no. I mean, I do think that we -- and we've done this for years, we operate at the top of the market in terms of the capabilities that are required, the talent we need to bring, the investment we need to make. And so that will, over time, create higher economics. That is not true on every procurement for sure, but on average, there is some truth to that statement. I do think that the reason on the margin front that we're ahead of pace on our three-year investment thesis is that we knew this was going to be a heavy investment period. I don't think we fully anticipated how much efficiency we could create in the business to be able to invest from inside that efficiency and reinvest in the business from there, which has allowed us to preserve margins, even as we invest in talent, in capabilities, and in positions that I think hopefully will fuel the next round of growth.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. The question comes from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBert Subin: Hey, good morning, and thank you for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Bert.\nBert Subin: Maybe just -- good morning. Horacio, just to follow up to some of your comments there around the business positioning growth. You've seen your staff headcount rise about 10% year-over-year, and organic growth is now in the teens levels relative to that 5% to 8% longer term expectation. As you think about that expectation, does that continue to be your view toward how the business should grow over time, or is something in your mind, be it AI or the geopolitical risk backdrop, accelerated how you think Booz can grow over the medium and long-term?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think what you're seeing right now, as I said, is the strength of our talent acquisition process, the ability to make investments in people, and a culture that keeps people here, coupled with a good environment out there and this unique positioning that we have around bringing technology to mission. I don't think that is a one-quarter or two-quarter or three-quarter deal. I think this is something that, if you extend it back, it goes back at least a decade or more, and if you extend it forward. I think this unique positioning is going to continue to allow us to outperform the market. That leads to the next question, which is, what is the market and how long will this type of market sustain? I think we are, honestly, very -- we appreciate the uncertainty in the funding environment. CRs running out in March, an election year, a political season that is going to add uncertainty to all of this, and we're watching that closely. One thing that is different this time than we've seen in the last couple of years is, typically, when you have this level of uncertainty, clients begin to pull back early because they're worried about the run rate, post-CR and into the future. We're not seeing that. We're actually seeing our clients be very focused on mission, very focused on investing in technology to bring to mission, and that is driving our growth today. Obviously, for the sake of Booz Allen, we want that to continue, but I think, for the sake of the country, this is a good thing.\nBert Subin: Got it. Okay. Thanks Horacio. And Matt, just a quick follow-up for you on the capital side of things. You mentioned your net leverage now 2.5 times, and that's on a trailing basis. If we look at that chart that you highlighted in the earnings presentation, you've been pretty balanced in how you've been allocating capital over the last couple of years. We've been starting to hear indications the M&A market is maybe getting a little better in terms of where seller expectations are and clearly where interest rates are going. As you think about M&A perhaps becoming a larger share of that capital allocation strategy, can you just talk about what you would look for in M&A and what you're not doing today that would be of interest to grow into inorganically?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks, Bert. First, our strategy isn't changing from a capital deployment and M&A perspective. I think we've always been biased to M&A over share repo, but the right M&A, right, that's strategic and that really helps us fill a gap in a capability or a business model. We don't need to buy for scale. As Horacio mentioned, as the numbers indicate, we're growing 13% to 14% organically this year. We don't need scale. What we're looking for are unique and oftentimes niche capabilities or business models that'll help us accelerate into some of these waves of technology or into areas where we think, for example, outcome based contracting may emerge. So, I've heard the same commentary, Bert. I think we are seeing indications that more assets and potentially assets of scale will come to market. My leading indicator is always how many bankers are asking me to lunch. And my dance card is full, particularly from the New York bankers, which typically indicate that more assets of scale are coming to market. I'm not sure that we're seeing yet enough data points to call it that prices have come down, but I certainly hope they will. Thank you, Bert. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And it comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hola, Maria. Good morning.\nMariana Perez Mora: So, my first question -- hola. My first question is about China. So, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, all these like defense focus on China and the mission and the role that Booz Allen could play there. What are the opportunities around JADC2? Because you recently announced this collaboration with LHX, like how you can play with the primes, how you can play directly with the government and how large that opportunity could be.\nHoracio Rozanski: It's a great question. JADC2 is a key strategic initiative to bring together all the information that a co-com commander would need to operationalize. And it's therefore an important deterrent to aggression. So, we're very committed to it. We're a significant part of it. We work closely with the CDAO on a number of initiatives that feed into JADC2 and into other efforts that ultimately may or may not integrate together into it, but are all part and parcel of the same thing, which is how do you create full domain awareness? How do you create a decision cycle that takes advantage of all of the data available and that accelerates inside of a potential adversary's decision cycle? That is something that Booz Allen is very good at. Our understanding of the mission, our ecosystem of partners that bring technology at scale, and the at-scale part is the crucial part here. And frankly, our ability to co-create with them and to build pipelines of solutions are a big part of it. And this is really what VoLT has been all about, doing that fast, doing that at-scale and bringing the right technology. And that's what we're focused on.\nMariana Perez Mora: Great. Thanks so much for the color. And my follow-up question is about headcount. So, we see all these great increases in headcount and the client staffing, but I'm curious if you could discuss a little bit about the clearances, how they are performing. And also, post-pandemic, you were able to be really flexible and really agile to adapt to these remote working. How are the customer's appetite to these remote working solutions as we go back to business as normal in the post-pandemic world?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Mariana, it\u2019s Matt. I'll take it. I don't think we're seeing any material improvements in the processing of clearances. It may be on the margins in certain areas, but nothing that is material from a firm-wide perspective. To your second question, we have tried to, and our clients, take advantage of a lot of the lessons learned through COVID about remote work, about flexibility, about the opportunities to combine and recombine how people interact and engage in different ways. We learned a lot, for example, about remote hiring and how to make our hiring process more efficiently through COVID. That has absolutely carried forward through to today. So, we are seeing that our clients are more receptive to alternate work arrangements. We really pride ourselves on our flexibility. And as Horacio said, undoubtedly, the labor market has gotten a little looser in the last 12 to 18 months, and that's been helpful. But our performance really is intentional. And we talk a lot about remarkable consistency in the business. It has been particularly true on the labor side or on the supply side. Our attrition is down meaningfully. Employee satisfaction is up, which we care a lot about. Our average monthly applications are on pace to double year-over-year, and a lot of that is technology-enabled. And we've seen an almost 60% increase in referrals, employer referrals, over the last three years. And I think that's, in many ways, the best indication of our employee value proposition and the fact that our employees are willing and eager to recommend us as a place to work and employer of choice to their network. So, the short answer to your question is yes. The longer answer is it requires a lot of work, and it's been very intentional.\nMariana Perez Mora: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And it comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please proceed.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, great quarter. You talked about, I mean, Intel was down, not unexpectedly, with FocusedFox. But you talk about that looking good. Give us some color on where you see it going from here. Have we passed the bottom? And secondly, you didn't talk much about global commercial. And this is the first quarter. It wasn't basically flat to down sequentially. It had a nice uptick. So, are we seeing something of a turn there?\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start with global commercial for a moment, and then spend more time on national security, if that's okay, Cai.\nCai von Rumohr: Yeah.\nHoracio Rozanski: Our global commercial business is really a small part of the portfolio. The numbers this quarter still reflect divestitures and softness in the commercial consulting side of the market, which I think is echoed by everything we see what's happening in the consulting industry in general. At this point, our incident response business there has accelerated. It's doing really great, and it's an important part of the offering. But what we really like about commercial is its connectivity to the rest of our business. If you think about our national cyber platform, adversaries look at the entire attack surface of the United States, and they don't care if it's private or public or at the intersection. And so, having this presence that cuts across. Makes us a valuable partner to our government clients as we support them here. But again, it's a small part of the portfolio. On the national security front, you explained already why the numbers are what they are this quarter. What we're seeing into the future is a business that has repositioned against the true technology side of intelligence. There's a lot more. AI space is growing as a significant part of our business. Our clients now look to us to create unique solutions. And they trust us to help them scale those solutions. We've spoken before, and Matt just talked about that business always is a little bit rate limited by the speed at which we can clear people or transfer clearances if they already have them. But even with that, we anticipate the growth and accelerating and building. They want some really interesting work. They have some great pipeline and the talent is staying, including some of the cyber talent that we talked about in the past is staying at Booz Allen and getting redeployed and redistributed against some of these key mission priorities.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. And a second one, the whole industry has benefited from a much looser labor environment. But you talked about that you're doing much better than you ever have in terms of taking people from higher to putting them onto the mission. Maybe give us some color in terms of what you're doing there to get that improvement.\nHoracio Rozanski: I'll start. I guess Matt's also been close to this. Credit to this goes to this is all done under the leadership of Kristine Martin Anderson, our COO, and she assembled a team from all of our enterprise operations and the markets to work this problem together to maximum effect. We used to have -- first of all, the first thing we identified is that the time we were not taking full advantage of the people that were applying, because we were too stovepiped in our approach. We have now built much more -- using both technology and process, much more cross-functional, cross-market view of this. So, easiest way to explain it is the runner up for a position doesn't get lost in the system, becomes all of that knowledge, positions that person for another similar opportunity. And again, that allows us to mine our incoming talent pipeline much more. Once we do that, we have gotten a lot better at shortening the cycle from the time we want to extend an offer to the time a person can join. That has been a lot of small changes, but each one of those significant. So that has been shortened. And then we're really very focused both for our incoming talent and for existing talent about giving them full access to the opportunity set that exists right here, right now. That helps attrition, because people stay longer if they can change jobs if they want to. But it really helps our new folks. We used to have this rule of thumb that it took 60 days to get somebody fully billable once they came through the door. That created fictional billability issues when we were hiring significantly like we are now. We have shattered that expectation. I don\u2019t -- I couldn't tell you what the actual number is today, in terms of reaching full billability, but it is a fraction of what it used to be. And when you put all of that together, that drives employee satisfaction. It drives economics. It frankly allows us to recruit with a somewhat -- to run this business at growth with a somewhat smaller bench. So, it's all to the good and it's all intentional. And then coupled with all the training that we're doing and all the things that we're doing to upskill people and to keep them here, I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing. So it's not -- and I agree with you, the market is a little easier than it was 18 months ago, two years ago. But I do think that part of this is all of these changes that we've made have, again, allowed us to outperform the labor market.\nMatt Calderone: And Cai, I can just add two things to what Horacio said. We typically talk about supply and demand separately and that in the short run, we're more supply constrained, but obviously the two work in sync. So, part of the reason that we're able to deploy people quickly on jobs is a lot of work out there, right? Our book-to-bill for -- LTM is now over 1.4 times. So, we have sold an awful lot of work. There's tremendous demand for employees, both internally in our internal marketplace, as Horacio mentioned, and externally in the hiring marketplace. And that's why, as Horacio said, our bench is actually at the lower end of what we've seen historically and why we are continuing to step on the gas from a talent acquisition standpoint. The other point I make is this remarkable consistency we've seen, not just over the last nine months, but really I think the last 18 from a labor standpoint has broken some of the historic norms and I think has tended to even out some of the peaks and valleys we see in utilization. And we are very consistently adding 150, 200 heads every month. And it just makes this -- it allows the system to work on a more regular basis.\nCai von Rumohr: Great answer. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our last question. And it comes from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nMatthew Akers: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Akers: So, I have a follow-up, I guess one more on the hiring. Is there a headcount growth number baked into your long-term 5% to 8% organic growth number? And based on what you're seeing, do you think, I guess, into 2025, maybe we still come in ahead of that based on some of the strengths you've talked about?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks Matt. And I'll actually tie this question together with a piece of what Sheila asked. We have said historically that for us to hit our growth targets, we aspire to have our LTM book-to-bill in the 1.2 to 1.3 range and our headcount in, let's say, the mid-single digits. And obviously, we're ahead of the mark on both measures. So, our LTM book-to-bill is 1.41 times and our annualized headcount growth is above 9% on the client staff. And if you look just over the first nine months, we're above 6%, which, again, is above historic targets and above our expectations for this year. So, we're not getting ahead of guidance. As Horacio said, we're acutely aware of some of the political and macroeconomic uncertainty, but there's a lot of momentum in the business. And we feel very comfortable with where we are.\nHoracio Rozanski: Hey, Matt. I love the fact that we're getting all these questions about talent. I think this is the most important topic. And so, I'll just maybe take us on a slight detour, and I hope you don't mind. But there's a natural tendency to look at companies like ours as a collection of contracts. And I do think, and this call proves it, that misses a little bit of the point. Because what we are is really a collection of people, in fact, more than a collection, an intentional team, purposeful team of people who serve clients leveraging contracts. And so, while the contracts are not important, it's really the strength of the talent base that we focus on to drive this business forward. And I think that has served us well and will continue to.\nMatthew Akers: Thanks. That's a great color. And I guess one more for Matt on cash taxes. Why did the Section 174 impact go up? And also, I think there's a bill going through to try to repeal that. Is there a way to think about how much you guys could get back if that happens? Is it kind of a few hundred million that potentially you could get?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Thanks Matt. Three things happened this quarter with taxes, two of which are pretty straightforward, and one of which is a little more complex. So, why don't I go through them in turn and answer your explicit question. First, we saw about $11 million benefit related to a foreign tax credit once we filed our 2023 tax returns. This is largely what drove us to reduce our full year ADEPS tax rate to 22% to 23%. Now, second, getting to 174, two things happened. We increased our estimated 2024 cash taxes related to 174 by about $125 million, from $100 million to $125 million. And that's really because we completed a thorough contract-by-contract analysis of the 174 impact. And we baked that $25 million into our cash guidance. And then lastly, based both on the contract review as well as the increased clarity from the IRS that we all received on the scope of 174, we rehearsed on a certain tax position that we began recording last Q4, and there was a knock-on effect to that tax position where we had decreased our GAAP tax -- we decrease our GAAP tax provision beginning in Q4 last year. We actually reversed that this quarter. We adjusted both of those out to provide a better view of what our steady state tax rate would be. So that's the explicit reason. We did a contract-by-contract review. If you take a step back, it's simply the size of our growth, right? And we're investing consistent with that growth is what drove our 174 tax expectations up for this year. With respect to what's happening on the Hill, we're obviously tracking it. Over time, you'd expect it to be completely reversed. Does it come in the form of a refund or credits? I don't think we know at this stage how -- whether it will happen, and if so, how it would be implemented. But ultimately, we would get all that cash back, and that would be used to further our capital deployment objectives.\nHoracio Rozanski: Just to make one quick point as we close off, and Matt said this, but I just want to double click on it because this 174 topic is complex, to say the least. I just want to make it clear the outperformance that we had this year was almost entirely driven by exceptional top line performance, exceptional margin performance, and really good cost management that has delivered the results that you're seeing through the first nine months.\nMatthew Akers: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the Q&A answer period. I will turn back to Horacio Rozanski for final comments.\nEnd of Q&A:\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Carmen. Thank you all for your questions and for joining us this morning. Before we close, allow me to take a moment to publicly express my deepest gratitude to each and every one of our incredible colleagues. The collective efforts of the nearly 34,000 people of Booz Allen produce the exceptional results that Matt and I have the privilege of discussing with you today. We're very proud of you, Booz Allen. We thank you for the passion and the commitment that you bring every day and for the world changing work that you do. And on that note, thank you again for joining us this morning and have a great day.\nOperator: And with that, thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Matt and I are very excited to share excellent financial results with you today. Booz Allen's record-breaking fiscal year continues. Our best first half has now extended into our strongest three quarters of growth since our firm went public in 2010. I am so proud of our team. Thanks to their efforts, we have achieved the strategic and operational momentum we aim for under our VoLT strategy. Our financial performance has been remarkably consistent. This quarter, we continue to deliver industry-leading double-digit organic revenue growth. We remain ahead of pace on our multi-year investment thesis and again, expect to exceed our guidance for the fiscal year. Given the continuing uncertainty in the market, from ongoing budget debates, geopolitical conflicts and the upcoming election, our clear focus remains to accelerate momentum and increase resiliency across our institution. Matt will take you through the full details of the quarter and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. For the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on putting our continued success in the context of our VoLT strategy. Let me begin with a little historical context. 2024 is Booz Allen's 110th year. Since our earliest days, we have embraced continual transformation as an imperative for relevance in the market and long-term growth. From World War II to the Apollo missions to the advent of digital government, Booz Allen anticipated the next waves of change early and transformed to meet the needs of each moment. Our goal has always been to stay a step ahead of our clients' requirements and help them drive their own transformations. Our firm has outperformed the market for decades because of four primary differentiators. Our ability to anticipate and adapt. Our capacity to invest and innovate. Our position on critical national missions. And most important, most important, our exceptional talent. All these factors hold true today. The current iteration of our century-long transformation journey is called VoLT, which stands for Velocity, Leadership, and Technology. We have been implementing this program for the past 24 months. The strategic aims of VoLT are to get faster and elevate our client impact, which in turn accelerate our growth and drive exceptional shareholder value. Our third quarter results demonstrate a few important things about our strategic progress. First, we have built resilience and driven momentum into the business, even as the external environment remains dynamic and uncertain. Second, we have strengthened our leadership position in the market as we transform missions of national importance with emerging technologies. And third, we have gained speed and efficiency in how we operate and grow our workforce. In sum, our VoLT strategy is working. As examples, let's look at two key missions we are transforming and at the amazing people who do this work. First, China. The National Defense Strategy describes China as DoD's pacing challenge, and it outlines the top priorities to strengthen the U.S. deterrence mission. The sheer geographic scale of this mission, which encompasses nearly half of the Earth's surface, creates both urgency and unique complexity for our clients. Through years of investment in the right technologies, talent, and partnerships, we are more prepared than ever to help our clients translate urgency into speed at scale. Today, we have more than 600 employees in the Indo-Pacific region working across various aspects of this mission. We have also forward deployed our innovation ecosystem. This provides our clients with faster, more direct access to emerging technologies. Our client focus is on accelerated readiness, supporting allies and partners, and bringing AI and cyber to key mission priorities. While there is much work to do, we are already having impact. A relevant public example is our recent win of a small, but strategic contract to build a private 5G network for the United States Navy in Guam. This work will leverage our early investments and expertise in 5G, edge computing, and zero trust to support secure communications, operations, and logistics on the island. Finally, I'll note that our firm's focus on the pacing challenge is not limited to our growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. Leveraging our lessons from Ukraine and other conflicts, we are considering how to tailor our solutions across all of our sectors. And given the scale and complexity of the China mission, we are also engaging our network of technology partners to mount an all-of-nation approach. In short, we are deeply committed to helping our clients defend U.S. interests. Because this is a long-term priority for our nation, it will be a long-term priority for Booz Allen. Pivoting next to our health business. For more than a decade, Booz Allen has been at the heart of many federal healthcare transformations. For example, we have worked to modernize care and benefits delivery for our veterans, implement health reform, and accelerate how life-saving drugs are safely brought to market. Through the strength of our work across these and many other missions, the health portfolio has crossed the $2 billion annual revenue threshold. Today, building on that success, we are poised to help our country transform the future of public health. Our recent win of the Data Modernization Accelerator contract, or DMAC, at the Centers for Disease Control, is a tremendous opportunity to improve data interoperability across the public health ecosystem. Our years of innovating at the VA and our early investments in cloud, machine learning, generative AI, and cyber positioned us well to win this work. Now Booz Allen is playing an integral role in helping the CDC unlock the power of data at scale, so our country can better prepare for and respond to critical public health emergencies. I've just described a small sample of the work we do at the center of the missions that matter most. More broadly, we are leading the way in redefining intelligence collection, implementing zero trust, and preparing for a post-quantum world. We are also focused on accelerating U.S. space superiority by harnessing data to speed decision-making and mission outcomes. To that end, we recently made a venture investment in a company called Albedo to leverage their leading-edge imagery capabilities as new data collection sources for our clients. The strategic importance of all these missions, coupled with our outstanding execution, build resilience in our business, and our relentless implementation of VoLT drives our momentum. Today, we are exactly where we want to be as we live our purpose to empower people to change the world. Because more than anything, at our core, we are a company of purpose-driven professionals. People join Booz Allen because they have a passion for doing world-changing work. People stay at Booz Allen because we invest in them and provide unique opportunities to solve tough challenges inside essential missions. Simply put, our people catalyze the potential of Booz Allen. So, my final point in our success with VoLT connects to our record headcount growth over the past six quarters. This is the result of intentional and focused efforts of our recruiting and business leaders to transform our talent acquisition processes. We are hiring, onboarding, and moving our talent to the missions they are passionate about faster than at any time in our history. These process improvements, combined with our increased investment in talent, create the conditions to grow our headcount at speed. This is crucial to accelerating our overall growth, which allows us to continue to invest and outpace the market. It is incredibly gratifying to see how VoLT is fully woven into our business and evident in the results we share today. We recognize that the hiring market and other macroeconomic conditions have improved in recent months. Even in a strong market, our outperformance, headcount gains, and new opportunity capture are the outcome of the purposeful empowerment of our leaders to take action in alignment with our strategy. And with that, Matt, I'll turn the call over to you. Good morning, Sheila. Thank you. Sheila, I'll take that one. And great headline, by the way. But let me start by maybe framing the whole performance, and then I'll be happy to go down into civil. At the firm-wide level, these have been the best three quarters, and we're on track for the best fiscal year since going public in 2010. And frankly, I go back further than that, and this is as good as I've ever seen. And the performance has been remarkably consistent. And if anything, we've been positively surprised by the strength of our talent acquisition and retention program, which really, as you know, fuels our revenue expillables [ph], which is the most important part. It does feel like, as an organic growth leader, we're in this virtual circle of excellent work allowing us to capture exceptional talent, which deliver great results for our clients, which deliver great results for our shareholders, which allow us to invest in the next wave of technologies, and so on and so forth. So in short, VoLT, which is our commitment to strategy, is working. And we are creating resilience and momentum in the business, even as we see the reality of an uncertain budget and funding and political season ahead of us. And so really, at the firm-wide -- so let me talk about civil, and I'll come back. Our civil business has been a star in our portfolio for, as you said, multiple years. In the early years of that amazing run, it really was driven around public health and some specific agencies in there. But really, as we look at the business now, we are a leader in digital transformation. We're a leader in cyber and in AI, and that is broad-based across the entire portfolio. So while, as I said, our health business now has crossed the $2 billion mark, and is certainly the larger part of this business, all elements from citizen services to law enforcement, it's all really working together or humming together to produce the results that you see. And you didn't ask, but the same is true in defense. And we really see real momentum and growth opportunity also building in our national security business. So, I guess maybe to close out a little bit and bring it all together, 110 years young is Booz Allen. This business is as vibrant today as it's ever been. Yes and no. I mean, I do think that we -- and we've done this for years, we operate at the top of the market in terms of the capabilities that are required, the talent we need to bring, the investment we need to make. And so that will, over time, create higher economics. That is not true on every procurement for sure, but on average, there is some truth to that statement. I do think that the reason on the margin front that we're ahead of pace on our three-year investment thesis is that we knew this was going to be a heavy investment period. I don't think we fully anticipated how much efficiency we could create in the business to be able to invest from inside that efficiency and reinvest in the business from there, which has allowed us to preserve margins, even as we invest in talent, in capabilities, and in positions that I think hopefully will fuel the next round of growth. Good morning, Bert. I think what you're seeing right now, as I said, is the strength of our talent acquisition process, the ability to make investments in people, and a culture that keeps people here, coupled with a good environment out there and this unique positioning that we have around bringing technology to mission. I don't think that is a one-quarter or two-quarter or three-quarter deal. I think this is something that, if you extend it back, it goes back at least a decade or more, and if you extend it forward. I think this unique positioning is going to continue to allow us to outperform the market. That leads to the next question, which is, what is the market and how long will this type of market sustain? I think we are, honestly, very -- we appreciate the uncertainty in the funding environment. CRs running out in March, an election year, a political season that is going to add uncertainty to all of this, and we're watching that closely. One thing that is different this time than we've seen in the last couple of years is, typically, when you have this level of uncertainty, clients begin to pull back early because they're worried about the run rate, post-CR and into the future. We're not seeing that. We're actually seeing our clients be very focused on mission, very focused on investing in technology to bring to mission, and that is driving our growth today. Obviously, for the sake of Booz Allen, we want that to continue, but I think, for the sake of the country, this is a good thing. Hola, Maria. Good morning. It's a great question. JADC2 is a key strategic initiative to bring together all the information that a co-com commander would need to operationalize. And it's therefore an important deterrent to aggression. So, we're very committed to it. We're a significant part of it. We work closely with the CDAO on a number of initiatives that feed into JADC2 and into other efforts that ultimately may or may not integrate together into it, but are all part and parcel of the same thing, which is how do you create full domain awareness? How do you create a decision cycle that takes advantage of all of the data available and that accelerates inside of a potential adversary's decision cycle? That is something that Booz Allen is very good at. Our understanding of the mission, our ecosystem of partners that bring technology at scale, and the at-scale part is the crucial part here. And frankly, our ability to co-create with them and to build pipelines of solutions are a big part of it. And this is really what VoLT has been all about, doing that fast, doing that at-scale and bringing the right technology. And that's what we're focused on. I'll start with global commercial for a moment, and then spend more time on national security, if that's okay, Cai. Our global commercial business is really a small part of the portfolio. The numbers this quarter still reflect divestitures and softness in the commercial consulting side of the market, which I think is echoed by everything we see what's happening in the consulting industry in general. At this point, our incident response business there has accelerated. It's doing really great, and it's an important part of the offering.

On the national security front, you explained already why the numbers are what they are this quarter. What we're seeing into the future is a business that has repositioned against the true technology side of intelligence. There's a lot more. AI space is growing as a significant part of our business. Our clients now look to us to create unique solutions. And they trust us to help them scale those solutions. We've spoken before, and Matt just talked about that business always is a little bit rate limited by the speed at which we can clear people or transfer clearances if they already have them. But even with that, we anticipate the growth and accelerating and building. They want some really interesting work. They have some great pipeline and the talent is staying, including some of the cyber talent that we talked about in the past is staying at Booz Allen and getting redeployed and redistributed against some of these key mission priorities. I'll start. I guess Matt's also been close to this.

And when you put all of that together, that drives employee satisfaction. It drives economics. It frankly allows us to recruit with a somewhat -- to run this business at growth with a somewhat smaller bench. So, it's all to the good and it's all intentional. And then coupled with all the training that we're doing and all the things that we're doing to upskill people and to keep them here, I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing. So it's not -- and I agree with you, the market is a little easier than it was 18 months ago, two years ago. But I do think that part of this is all of these changes that we've made have, again, allowed us to outperform the labor market. Good morning. Hey, Matt. I love the fact that we're getting all these questions about talent. I think this is the most important topic. And so, I'll just maybe take us on a slight detour, and I hope you don't mind. But there's a natural tendency to look at companies like ours as a collection of contracts. And I do think, and this call proves it, that misses a little bit of the point. Because what we are is really a collection of people, in fact, more than a collection, an intentional team, purposeful team of people who serve clients leveraging contracts. And so, while the contracts are not important, it's really the strength of the talent base that we focus on to drive this business forward. And I think that has served us well and will continue to. Just to make one quick point as we close off, and Matt said this, but I just want to double click on it because this 174 topic is complex, to say the least. I just want to make it clear the outperformance that we had this year was almost entirely driven by exceptional top line performance, exceptional margin performance, and really good cost management that has delivered the results that you're seeing through the first nine months."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio and thanks to all of you for joining our call today. I will start by saying that I am incredibly proud of the financial performance we are reporting today.  Our third quarter results are further proof that our VoLT strategy is working and Booz Allen continues to build momentum. We are investing in cutting-edge technologies, hiring the right people, building critical partnerships, and winning work at scale. These strengths are the source of confidence and resilience in our business. As Horacio noted, we have now recorded the strongest first three quarters of a fiscal year since our IPO. Our performance has been remarkably consistent on the supply side, on the demand side, and in how we are operating the business. Based on this performance, we are ahead of pace against our three-year investment thesis, and we are especially pleased to raise our fiscal year 2024 guidance again today. Now let's dive into the details. Please turn to slide six. Total revenue for the quarter grew 12.9% year-over-year to approximately $2.6 billion. Organic revenue was up 12.8% year-over-year, and revenue excluding billable expenses increased 13% year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. This exceptional top-line performance was fueled by our strategic position in the market, robust demand for our services and solutions, and our ability to attract and retain elite talent. Taking it now sector by sector, our defense business continues to excel. Revenue was up roughly 17% compared to the third quarter of the last fiscal year. And this performance is strong and broad-based. Our team remains focused on accelerating access to data and decision-making tools and providing next-generation solutions to warfighters on critical missions across the globe. Our civil business is also growing fast, up roughly 18% year-over-year with double-digit growth across the portfolio. Booz Allen is unleashing the power of data to achieve better and faster mission outcomes for our civil government clients, from health and life sciences to infrastructure and climate. As anticipated, the pace of growth in our intelligence business slowed in the third quarter. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year. Our Intel leaders are winning exciting new work in key mission areas and have had success retaining critical talent, people who can now support cyber missions across the firm. This business is on a strong vector for the future. Finally, our global commercial business, which represented 2% of revenue in the quarter, was down about 22% year-over-year. This reflects divestitures disclosed last fiscal year and overall softness in the commercial cyber consulting market. Moving on to bookings on slide seven. The award environment is strong and our market leaders are doing an outstanding job shaping and winning work consistent with our VoLT strategy. Despite uncertainty about the near and long-term budget environment, our government clients and the people of Booz Allen remain laser-focused on meeting the country's urgent mission needs. This quarter, net bookings totaled nearly $1.9 billion. Our third quarter book-to-bill was 0.72 times, our best third quarter book-to-bill since fiscal year 2018. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was 1.41 times, well above our trailing five-year average. Total backlog as of December 31st stands at $34.3 billion, up 14.2% year-over-year. Funded backlog grew 15.4% to $5.2 billion. Unfunded backlog declined 9.2% to $9.2 billion. And priced options were up 29.3% to $19.9 billion. In sum, demand is strong. We have a solid foundation to remain the industry's organic growth leader. Turning now to headcount. Booz Allen closed out calendar year 2023 with nearly 34,000 people. Total headcount is up 8.6% year-over-year, and client staff headcount is up 9.2%. We efficiently deploy our people on contracts and ensure they are empowered to succeed. This people-centric culture, including continuous investments in our employees, furthers their commitment to Booz Allen and in turn makes them ambassadors to future talent. Since the start of the fiscal year, client staff has increased more than 6%, exceeding our expectations as well as the 3% to 5% target we had set for the year. This level of client staff growth, combined with our healthy bookings, positions us well for the next fiscal year. Moving now to the bottom line. We earned $291 million in adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. This is 19.1% higher than the third quarter last fiscal year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.3% is roughly 60 basis points higher than for the same period a year ago. As you may recall, we manage the business on an annual basis. We indicated last quarter that we anticipated a somewhat flatter quarterly margin profile than in recent years. This pattern played out as we expected in the third quarter. Booz Allen pursues complex work that sits at the center of our client's mission and at the top of the technical stack. This requires us to invest ahead of the market. The quality of our work, coupled with our ability to get scale out of the business even as we ramp up investment, allows us to consistently deliver superior financial results. Third quarter net income was $146 million. The year-over-year increase of 374.6% in net income is primarily a result of the legal reserve of $124 million recorded in the third quarter of last fiscal year. This is partially offset by an increase in our provision for income taxes associated with the reversal of an uncertain tax position related to Section 174. Adjusted net income increased 29.4% year-over-year to $184 million. This excludes the impact of the legal reserve and the increase in our provision for income taxes. Due to the same factors, diluted earnings per share grew 382.6% year-over-year to $1.11, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31.8% year-over-year to $1.41. Moving now to the balance sheet. We entered the third quarter with $602 million of cash on hand. Free cash flow for the quarter was $211 million, the result of $234 million of cash from operating activities plus $23 million of CapEx. Collections were strong for the quarter and included some payments we expected to receive in the fourth quarter. Cash outflows remained consistent with our outsized growth and sizable investments in our people and capabilities. Our net debt at the end of the third quarter was approximately $2.8 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA for the trailing 12 months. Turning to capital deployment on slide eight. We returned close to $156 million of capital to shareholders in the third quarter. This included approximately $94 million in share of purchases at an average price of $123.52 per share and $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Today I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a $0.04 increase to our quarterly cash dividend. This dividend of $0.51 per share will be payable on March 1st to stockholders of record as of February 12th. Now for a look ahead. On our last call, we updated our full year guidance to incorporate both the momentum we had built and the strong possibility of a two to 4-week government shutdown. Our revised guidance reflects the strength of our third quarter and the continued momentum of the business. While there is still uncertainty about government funding, we now believe that a multi-week government shutdown is significantly less likely to occur in our current fiscal year. Thus, we are no longer including a material shutdown related contingency in our guidance. Let me now take you through our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance. Please turn to slide nine. At the top line, we now expect revenue growth of 14% to 15%, 13% to 14% of which will be organic. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $1.155 billion and $1.175 billion, which equates to approximately 14% to 16% growth year-over-year. This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 11%. We are also increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $5.25 to $5.40 per share. This is driven by the increase in EBITDA and a modest decrease in our ADEPS tax rate, which we now expect to be between 22% to 23%. We are raising our guidance for net cash provided by operating activities to be between $200 million and $275 million. This range includes a roughly $25 million increase in our estimated fiscal year 2024 cash taxes related to Section 174. And finally, we still expect CapEx of roughly $85 million, and we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $115 million to $190 million. In closing, our business is performing exceptionally well. We have just delivered the best three quarters since Booz Allen's IPO, with remarkably consistent performance, even in the midst of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. This is a real testament to the quality of our leadership and the power of our VoLT strategy. Our firm is on a sustainable, quality growth path. The energy at Booz Allen is palpable. Our people are excited about the work they do, the impact they have, the strong performance we have delivered, and the many opportunities that lie ahead. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Yeah. Thanks, Bert. First, our strategy isn't changing from a capital deployment and M&A perspective. I think we've always been biased to M&A over share repo, but the right M&A, right, that's strategic and that really helps us fill a gap in a capability or a business model. We don't need to buy for scale. As Horacio mentioned, as the numbers indicate, we're growing 13% to 14% organically this year. We don't need scale. What we're looking for are unique and oftentimes niche capabilities or business models that'll help us accelerate into some of these waves of technology or into areas where we think, for example, outcome based contracting may emerge. So, I've heard the same commentary, Bert. I think we are seeing indications that more assets and potentially assets of scale will come to market. My leading indicator is always how many bankers are asking me to lunch. And my dance card is full, particularly from the New York bankers, which typically indicate that more assets of scale are coming to market. I'm not sure that we're seeing yet enough data points to call it that prices have come down, but I certainly hope they will. Thank you, Bert. Appreciate it. Yeah. Mariana, it's Matt. I'll take it. I don't think we're seeing any material improvements in the processing of clearances. It may be on the margins in certain areas, but nothing that is material from a firm-wide perspective. To your second question, we have tried to, and our clients, take advantage of a lot of the lessons learned through COVID about remote work, about flexibility, about the opportunities to combine and recombine how people interact and engage in different ways. We learned a lot, for example, about remote hiring and how to make our hiring process more efficiently through COVID. That has absolutely carried forward through to today. So, we are seeing that our clients are more receptive to alternate work arrangements. We really pride ourselves on our flexibility. And as Horacio said, undoubtedly, the labor market has gotten a little looser in the last 12 to 18 months, and that's been helpful. But our performance really is intentional. And we talk a lot about remarkable consistency in the business. It has been particularly true on the labor side or on the supply side. Our attrition is down meaningfully. Employee satisfaction is up, which we care a lot about. Our average monthly applications are on pace to double year-over-year, and a lot of that is technology-enabled. And we've seen an almost 60% increase in referrals, employer referrals, over the last three years. And I think that's, in many ways, the best indication of our employee value proposition and the fact that our employees are willing and eager to recommend us as a place to work and employer of choice to their network. So, the short answer to your question is yes. The longer answer is it requires a lot of work, and it's been very intentional. And Cai, I can just add two things to what Horacio said. We typically talk about supply and demand separately and that in the short run, we're more supply constrained, but obviously the two work in sync. So, part of the reason that we're able to deploy people quickly on jobs is a lot of work out there, right? Our book-to-bill for -- LTM is now over 1.4 times. So, we have sold an awful lot of work. There's tremendous demand for employees, both internally in our internal marketplace, as Horacio mentioned, and externally in the hiring marketplace. And that's why, as Horacio said, our bench is actually at the lower end of what we've seen historically and why we are continuing to step on the gas from a talent acquisition standpoint. The other point I make is this remarkable consistency we've seen, not just over the last nine months, but really I think the last 18 from a labor standpoint has broken some of the historic norms and I think has tended to even out some of the peaks and valleys we see in utilization. And we are very consistently adding 150, 200 heads every month. And it just makes this -- it allows the system to work on a more regular basis. Good morning, Matt. Yeah. Thanks Matt. And I'll actually tie this question together with a piece of what Sheila asked. We have said historically that for us to hit our growth targets, we aspire to have our LTM book-to-bill in the 1.2 to 1.3 range and our headcount in, let's say, the mid-single digits. And obviously, we're ahead of the mark on both measures. So, our LTM book-to-bill is 1.41 times and our annualized headcount growth is above 9% on the client staff. And if you look just over the first nine months, we're above 6%, which, again, is above historic targets and above our expectations for this year. So, we're not getting ahead of guidance. As Horacio said, we're acutely aware of some of the political and macroeconomic uncertainty, but there's a lot of momentum in the business. And we feel very comfortable with where we are. Yeah. Thanks Matt. Three things happened this quarter with taxes, two of which are pretty straightforward, and one of which is a little more complex. So, why don't I go through them in turn and answer your explicit question. First, we saw about $11 million benefit related to a foreign tax credit once we filed our 2023 tax returns. This is largely what drove us to reduce our full year ADEPS tax rate to 22% to 23%. Now, second, getting to 174, two things happened. We increased our estimated 2024 cash taxes related to 174 by about $125 million, from $100 million to $125 million. And that's really because we completed a thorough contract-by-contract analysis of the 174 impact. And we baked that $25 million into our cash guidance. And then lastly, based both on the contract review as well as the increased clarity from the IRS that we all received on the scope of 174, we rehearsed on a certain tax position that we began recording last Q4, and there was a knock-on effect to that tax position where we had decreased our GAAP tax -- we decrease our GAAP tax provision beginning in Q4 last year. We actually reversed that this quarter. We adjusted both of those out to provide a better view of what our steady state tax rate would be. So that's the explicit reason. We did a contract-by-contract review. If you take a step back, it's simply the size of our growth, right? And we're investing consistent with that growth is what drove our 174 tax expectations up for this year. With respect to what's happening on the Hill, we're obviously tracking it. Over time, you'd expect it to be completely reversed. Does it come in the form of a refund or credits? I don't think we know at this stage how -- whether it will happen, and if so, how it would be implemented. But ultimately, we would get all that cash back, and that would be used to further our capital deployment objectives."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to Booz Allen Hamilton's Earnings Call covering Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Results. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nathan Rutledge.\nNathan Rutledge: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We hope you had an opportunity to read the press release we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. With me today to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown in this disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking and may relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our SEC filings and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release and slides. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Today, Matt and I have the privilege of discussing with you another quarter of Booz Allen's market-leading performance. But before we get to that, I would like to open this call as I have done several times in the past, by putting our work in the context of world events. On October 7, the world was shocked by a murderous terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas on the people of Israel. We at Booz Allen, stand in mourning and solidarity with Israel, the victims, and their families. We pray for the safe return of all the hostages and would stand side by side with the U.S. government in condemnation of Hamas in support of Israel's defense and in the protection of all civilians. In the intervening weeks, Booz Allen has done what we do best. We have conducted listening sessions, creating spaces to support our colleagues in mourning or afraid for both our Israeli and Palestinian loved ones living in the region. We have launched a [Match Giving] (ph) campaign. And importantly, we have supported our U.S. client's missions. Because this is personal for me too. I have felt the warm embrace of the entire Booz Allen community. I am so proud and so grateful to each one of my colleagues for showing the best of Booz Allen at a time of crisis and loss. This morning, I felt it was important to share this with you for two reasons. First, because these horrendous events remind us of the urgency of our work, bringing leading-edge technology to critical missions, in the hope of preventing and deterring things like this from ever happening. And second, because our internal response is yet another reminder of the unique culture and people of Booz Allen. They are the unshakable foundation for our exceptional performance, decade after decade. So, turning now to performance. Our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was outstanding. Our Booz Allen team once again delivered industry-leading organic revenue growth, a strong bottom-line and record backlog. On our last earnings call, we emphasized the importance of having a strong second quarter. Our results show we succeeded. We built resiliency in the business and enter the second half of the fiscal year with significant momentum even as the uncertainty about the federal budget persists. We now expect to exceed our original plan for this fiscal year. As a result, we are pleased to announce an increase to our top- and bottom-line guidance for fiscal year 2024. Matt will take you through it, and also deep-dive on our performance in a few minutes. My goal for today is to connect our performance with our strategy and longer-term financial objectives. We are halfway through the three-year investment thesis outlined in late 2021, and deep into the implementation of VoLT. So, this seems like a good moment to pause to take stock and to offer a self-appraisal of our progress. I'll begin by going back to what we said at our Investor Day in October 2021. At that point, we saw an extraordinary opportunity. We expected emerging technologies, such as AI, cyber, 5G and quantum to rapidly transform how our government operates over this decade. And we said our first-mover advantage positioned us to maximize this opportunity to accelerate our growth, to take our industry leadership to the next level and to drive outstanding shareholder value. At that time, we also laid out a multi-year investment thesis centered on growing adjusted EBITDA by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. We envisioned a path to accomplish this goal that included above-market organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% annually, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10% with continued investment capacity for future growth, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment, prioritizing small- to mid-size strategic acquisitions. Simply put, we are ahead of our expected pace at the midpoint of our investment thesis period. Our organic revenue growth of 9% in fiscal year 2023, and 15.7% in the first half of fiscal year '24 is well above the target range. And we have done this while investing in the business and maintaining margins above our original expectation. Our extraordinary organic performance has put us on a path to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target with far less capital deployment than we initially thought would be required. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm the adjusted EBITDA range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. And importantly, we expect to reach our goals while building an even stronger balance sheet. As of now, we are decreasing our baseline capital deployment expectations to $2 billion to $3.5 billion, which is approximately $1 billion less than we had initially anticipated. This provides us with the additional balance sheet capacity to create shareholder value over the next 18 months and beyond. As the world, the financial markets and the federal budget become more volatile in the coming years, we are positioning Booz Allen to serve clients with distinction, while investing in future growth avenues. These are the keys to growing and rewarding our talent and creating superior shareholder value. Moreover, these outstanding results demonstrate our VoLT growth strategy is working. VoLT stands for Velocity, Leadership and Technology. And over the past 18 months, we moved rapidly to implement. Booz Allen needed to transform itself to gain the speed and scale required to serve our clients' evolving needs. To do this, we aim to get faster in our decision-making and operations. We also set out to build and scale leading positions that transfer missions through the use of new technologies. Today, our aspirations are becoming a reality. Let me offer two examples. First, the meteoric rise of AI proves our readiness to deliver a greater speed and scale. As great power competition demands accelerated adoption of AI across every facet of the federal government, we are positioned to respond to our clients' complex needs. Earlier this month, we hosted some of you at our Helix Center for Innovation. We showed you how we are combining our exceptional talent, diverse ecosystem of innovation partners and trusted frameworks to create differentiated AI solutions. We can rapidly tailor our proven solutions to insert AI into a range of critical missions, from empowering the warfighter at the edge to improving health outcomes. And we see significant opportunities ahead to expand and deepen our impact as we continue integrating AI with other technologies. The second example of VoLT's successful implementation is how we continue to transform our existing businesses to stay at the leading-edge. We got on cyber business and our recent $1.86 billion award of Thunderdome illustrate this very well. Through this work, we combined our historical strengths in cyber tradecraft and mission understanding, with our ability to leverage key commercial technologies into scalable solutions. Thunderdome puts Booz Allen at the center of DISA's effort to implement a zero-trust architecture across the Department of Defense's complex technical infrastructure. This is a critical task, demanding all of Booz Allen's and our tech partners' talent and ingenuity. As we continue to scale this work, we expect it to create opportunities to extend elements of this solution across the whole federal government and beyond. This is VoLT in action. To close, I am extremely proud of the progress we have made towards our ambitious goals over the past 18 months. The results we share today increased Booz Allen's resilience as our market and federal budget environment grow more uncertain. We are taking our leadership position to a new level and increasing our impact across the most critical and enduring missions. The amazing people of Booz Allen work relentlessly, relentlessly on behalf of our clients and our nation. Their passion to make the world better and safer fills me with optimism about the future. It invigorates my belief that we can empower people to change the world. And with that, Matt, over to you.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. The Booz Allen team delivered another exceptional quarter. Our success across the portfolio in shaping demand and capturing opportunities, in hiring and deploying talent onto contracts, and most important, in serving our clients' mission sets us up very well for the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond. Booz Allen prides itself on delivering for our clients, our people and our shareholders, quarter after quarter and year after year. We are proud to be in a position today to raise our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our team continues to build both momentum and resiliency for the long-term. And as Horacio noted, we are ahead of where we expect it to be against the adjusted EBITDA dollar goal in our three-year investment thesis. Now, let's dive into the specifics of our second quarter performance. Please turn to Slide 6. Total revenue for the quarter grew 16% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 14.8% year-over-year. Revenue excluding billable expenses increased 14.1% year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Our exceptional top-line performance continues to be driven by strong demand for our services and solutions and steady headcount growth. Our business continues to exhibit strength across the portfolio. Across all markets, we are seeing the results of our leaders embracing the VoLT strategy. Our Defense business is driving, with revenue up approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year. Growth in this market is broad-based. We continue to bring technology and tradecraft to critical national missions. Our Civil business revenue was up roughly 17% year-over-year, with strong performance across the board. Our Intelligence business grew 4% year-over-year and has almost entirely absorbed the roll-off of a large classified contract. We had a number of significant new wins in the first half of the year and are very encouraged by the progress our leaders have made and hiring clear talent and evolving this portfolio. Finally, our Global Commercial business, which accounted for 1% of revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 45% year-over-year, reflecting the divestiture disclosed last fiscal year. Moving onto bookings. The award environment remains robust. The second quarter is historically our strongest for bookings. This quarter, net bookings totaled approximately $6.4 billion. This includes $1.1 billion of the $1.86 billion Thunderdome contract award, and the full value of the recently awarded $1.6 billion DMAC contract. Our second quarter book-to-bill was 2.41 times, in-line with the same-period a year-ago. And our trailing 12 month book-to-bill was 1.29 times. Total backlog as of September 30, grew to a record $35 billion, up 10.1% year-over-year. Funded backlog increased 14.7% to $6.3 billion. Unfunded backlog dipped 2.4% to $10.1 billion, and priced options grew 16.6% to $18.6 billion. Looking forward, we continue to execute on a rich pipeline of opportunities. Our fiscal year 2024 qualified pipeline is up 35% compared to this time last year and stands at $26.2 billion. In sum, we have both the award and the pipeline to support our near-term and medium-term growth objectives. Turning now to headcount, Booz Allen grew to more than 33,000 people strong at the end of September. Client staff headcount was 11.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Total headcount increased 10.3%. Hiring, onboarding and deploying talent onto contracts continues to be a top priority. These efforts have yielded a 4% increase in client staff since the beginning of the fiscal year, and we remain in a growth posture. Therefore, today, we are well-positioned to exceed our full year target of 3% to 5% client staff headcount growth. Moving now to the bottom-line. We earned $291 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. This is 1.6% higher than the second quarter last year and in-line with our expectations for the quarter. Our principal focus remains on EBITDA dollar growth. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% was approximately 150 basis points lower than the same period a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, margins in the quarter were diluted by a higher billable expense ratio and a small shift in contract mix towards cost-reimbursable work due to the rapid growth in our Defense business. We continue to manage costs and execute contracts exceptionally well, which allows us to both deliver financial results in the near term and invest for the long term. This year, we do expect a slightly flatter pattern of quarterly margins compared to recent years. Second quarter net income was roughly flat year-over-year at $171 million. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted net income declined 4.9% year-over-year to $169 million. Diluted earnings per share grew 0.8% year-over-year to $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.7% year-over-year to $1.29. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $557 million of cash on hand. This includes proceeds from the successful investment-grade bond offering that we executed in August. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $64.3 million. The result of $47.4 million used for operating activities, and $16.9 million of CapEx. Note that in July, we paid out the previously discussed settlement with the Department of Justice. Excluding that payment, operating cash flow was up almost 12% year-over-year. Collections were solid for the quarter, but cash outflows remained high due to our rapid growth and continued investments in the business. Our net debt at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.9 billion. And our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.7 times adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we returned approximately $143 million of capital to shareholders. This included approximately $81 million in share repurchases at an average price of $116.98 per share and $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share, that will be payable on December 4, to stockholders of record as of November 15. As Horacio noted, September 30 marked both the midpoint of our current fiscal year and the halfway point of our three-year investment thesis. Our leadership team could not be prouder of our performance to-date. On our last call, we highlighted three things that would be key to our full year performance: second quarter bookings, second quarter headcount growth, and the potential for a government shutdown. Our bookings and headcount growth in the quarter exceeded expectations, but there is still uncertainty about government funding beyond November. Thus, our updated guidance incorporates both the momentum we have built and the strong possibility of a multi-week government shutdown. We have built the assumption of a two to four week partial government shutdown into our guidance ranges. On this front, we continue to hope for certainty, but plan for volatility. It is significant that we are raising full year guidance even with this assumption of a multi-week partial government shutdown. Let me now take you through our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance. Please turn to Slide 9. At the top-line, we now expect revenue growth of 11% to 14%. 10% to 13% of which will be organic. And we do expect billable expenses will decline in the second half. Our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged. We still expect margins to be in the high 10% to 11% range. As I noted earlier, we anticipate our margin profile for the full year will be flatter than it has been in recent years, even with our traditional ramp-up of investment in talent and capability building in the second half. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA dollar guidance to between $1.115 billion and $1.145 billion, or approximately 10% to 13% growth year-over-year. We are increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 per share. We are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at between $160 million and $260 million. This includes the impact of higher interest payments, connected to our recent bond issuance. We now expect CapEx of approximately $85 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $75 million to $175 million. In sum, our business is strong and our VoLT strategy is working. Our management team is excited about the momentum we feel, the great work we're doing, and the value we're creating for our people, our clients, and our investors. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mariana Perez Mora from Bank of America.\nMariana Perez Mora: Good morning, everyone.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMariana Perez Mora: So, my questions is around AI. It was really impressive to see all the applications that you have on AI at the edge. And I'd like you to discuss how much growth you see there. And how dependent is this expansion or the timing of this on a budget situation?\nHoracio Rozanski: Well, Mariana, it's good to hear an Argentinian accent this early in the morning and not be the only one. Well, I think, as you know from the conversations we had at Helix a couple of weeks ago, our business this year is forecasted, our AI business, in the $500 million to $700 million range and we see significant growth over the coming years. And that growth is broad-based. We talk a lot and we talk on these calls about the work we're doing in Defense, but our work Intelligence and our work across the Civil agencies on AI is also growing well. And as you saw, we have some unique solutions that are the product of our talent, some frameworks that are proprietary to Booz Allen and work we do with commercial partners to bring dual-use technology into these missions. That, I think, set us apart. So, we are very bullish about the future. To your question about budgets, clearly, we are looking very closely at what's happening on the Hill. As Matt pointed out, we are, at this point, making into our guidance the potential for a government shutdown. We hope it won't happen, but we need to be realistic about that. And we need to be realistic about the fact that, if budget compress in the future, the competition for resources across every federal agency will increase. Now having said that, from our perspective, VoLT has put us in the middle of key enduring missions where we're bringing unique capabilities and that's why we're both raising guidance and reaffirming that we're ahead of pace to deliver on our multi-year investment thesis. So, we feel really good about where we are.\nMariana Perez Mora: And how much of your growth is insulated from -- in the near-term from this like budget certainty? So, said otherwise, how much upside do you have in the near-term, if you were to have a budget, like, early next year?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's hard to predict precisely. We've tried to incorporate that in the way we -- that's why guidance is a range as opposed to -- it really is a broader range these years than it's been in the past to accommodate more scenarios. I think maybe the thing to point you to is the fact that, because budget passed last December, we saw the ability to work against a lot of latent underlying demand in the business. And that's why we're growing as well as we're growing now, and then we've had the success that we've had. I mean, this is really, I've been around for a long time, as you know, probably the best first half, I've seen at least since the IPO, possibly best first half we've had in my 30-plus years at Booz Allen. So, clearly there's momentum in the business, we're building resilience in the business in anticipation of funding challenges, but we are pedal to the metal.\nMariana Perez Mora: Thanks so much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bert Subin from Stifel.\nBert Subin: Great, good morning. Just to follow-up to Mariana's question there, at your [AI end event] (ph), you provided data around the headcount and sales expectations just for the business across Booz. Those expectations indicated lower utilization of your AI workforce, just relative to your broader client-facing staff. How quickly should we expect revenue utilization to rise across AI? And how does that make you think about the growth opportunity beyond FY '24? Horacio, I know you said you're bullish, but is that something that can flip pretty quickly?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah, Bert, I'll take it first. Look, I think we showed you, as you said -- we arranged the business from a revenue perspective and told you how many AI practitioners we have. But it's purely apples to apples, because we have AI practitioners that are supporting non-AI projects and vice-versa. Our AI folks are probably less utilized than the rest of the business because we are investing a significant amount in that business. There are a lot of folks who are building capabilities, supporting innovation, driving our AI governance model, et cetera. But we see significant growth there not just from those staff but from a broader set of staff that we're training and upskilling from a technology perspective. The other thing, I'll mention, it's relevant both to your question and to Mariana's is we also highlighted at the [AI end event] (ph), the extent to which AI is now being bundled into large procurements. And the success we're having when that in fact happens. Increasingly, we're seeing, not just for AI, but for Cyber, for Digital, for some of the hardware engineering and integration that we do that is bundled together, because if you think about our complex mission problem, it requires AI to enable it, Cyber to protect it, you've got to integrate it into a software and network system, oftentimes it has to be integrated into some type of hardware product. So, I wouldn't just think about AI from a traditional perspective. It really is having a much broader impact across the base of our business and is being integrated into the technology stacks we have writ large.\nHoracio Rozanski: Let me add two small points to what Matt said, which very much resonates. One point is, if you look at the level of investment that we're putting into AI, it's relatively modest to the success that we're having. And a lot of that is because we start early on these technologies, and we wait and we plan and we position. So that the ones that go exponential, we can -- like AI has, we can stay ahead of the trend and we are still ahead of the game there and that's, that's really exciting. And then the second point, I'll point you back at the inter galactic level to the power of our single P&L, and the ability to really manage resources as an institution as opposed to in small buckets, which gave us the opportunity to flex our workforce in a way that is pretty unique to Booz Allen and that gives us all the growth that we're talking about.\nBert Subin: Super helpful, Horacio and Matt. Just a follow-up for you, Matt, maybe thinking more about the cost structure. Maybe not directly related to AI, but partially your G&A expense at least as a percentage of your sales continues to fall, and is growing certainly much slower than your sales growth. Can we expect that to be an engine for future margin expansion, or is that something that normalizes over time?\nMatt Calderone: It could generate more margins, but really this has been intentional over the past few years. We're shifting cost and investment from the infrastructure into the business. I mean, as Horacio said, relative to some of the hyperscalers, our investment in AI is modest, but we're investing a lot of money there. So, it has been a very intentional structured effort led by all of our business leaders to become as efficient as possible on the corporate side so we can invest in the business and in growth and in the capabilities our clients want.\nBert Subin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, Horacio and Matt. Thanks so much for that introduction and the Helix visit as well. When we think about your organic growth, just to start on that, organic growth, 15% in the first half, really great results, Defense, up 24%, another acceleration. How much of that is due to improving DoD outlays? And maybe if you could remind us your expectations across the different customer basis for the year in terms of the top-line?\nHoracio Rozanski: Hi, Sheila, good morning. I'll start, Matt might want to add. I'll say the following. When you look across the entirety of our business, Defense, Civil and Intel, 24% and 17%, 4%-plus growth while absorbing changes in the contract portfolio, it's really broad-based. We are hitting on all cylinders across all of these. It's not one program, it's not one piece, it's not one dynamic. I think, in general, it's attributable to VoLT. VoLT is giving us both momentum and resiliency. The momentum is evident in the numbers, and in the fact that we're raising guidance while accounting for the potential for a government shutdown. And the resiliency is equally important, because to your point, I mean, we do see increased uncertainty in the funding picture. At this point, we continue to see clients moving aggressively against our key priorities in other cycles like this. We have seen clients maybe pull back in anticipation. And perhaps it's because of the missions we support, perhaps it's because of the geopolitical dynamics and the uniqueness of our offerings that we're still seeing that. But we are both growing fast and running tightly so that we can create the environment in which we can continue to both invest and protect our workforce if the budgets get tight or get interrupted for a period of time. So, we're excited about where we are across all the markets, in Defense, in particular. Like I said, I mean, every part of our Defense business is growing nicely. It's the only way to get to 24%, and it has really transformed to grow along the lines of bringing technology to mission.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: No, that's super helpful color.\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. Sheila...\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure, Matt.\nMatt Calderone: Obviously, 10% to 15% organic growth for the year, we're growing above market, clearly. But as Horacio said, it's the quality of the underlying growth and the depths of that, that really has us excited, because it gives us not just momentum but the resiliency to write out potential dislocation from a budgetary environment.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: And Matt, just another follow-up for you, if I may. Can you talk about the accounts receivable balance in terms of the cash? How we should expect sort of working capital improvements from here on that balance? And also the impact revenues, how we should see that progression?\nMatt Calderone: Sure. I'll take that in a couple of parts. First, and we've talked about the puts and takes on cash for a couple of calls now. On the positive side, we're certainly generating more profit, our CapEx has declined, and we've improved collections. But there are headwinds. The DoD settlement, obviously, higher cash taxes, driven by our growth in 174, higher interest expense. And as you mentioned, our outsized growth, we are consuming working capital to support it. I mean, just to give you one example, we're required to pay small businesses within 30 days. And so, as we're growing, we're typically paying them faster than we're collecting. With respect to our outstanding receivable balance, I think you're getting at the question of some of the unbilled receivables on our balance sheet, because you've asked that previously. We are working -- a meaningful portion of that is tied up with -- in past-year audits. We are working with DCAA, DCMA, both well and quickly to try to resolve that. It's going to be likely a multi-year process, but things are going well. And at this time, we have no ability to project what's -- when and how that will be resolved.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: And just on the revenue line, I think that you called out $18 million from the reduction at the provision. So, those should be conceived as positive as you sort of retrieve those payments, is that how to think about it?\nMatt Calderone: Yes. I mean, that, in particular, has to do with -- it changed our reg reserve we made relative to our '22 audit and the results of '22 audit, but there are going to be puts and takes over the next couple of quarters, and a couple years as we work to resolve these. So, it was a positive this quarter, we're not making any predictions about future quarters.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Louie DiPalma from William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: Horacio, Matt and Nathan, good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nMatt Calderone: Hello, Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: Horacio and Matt, you forecast lower capital deployment through fiscal '25. Has your VoLT and your venture capital program been so successful and selling prices so high that you are no longer interested in another Liberty-sized acquisition? And are you signaling more stock buybacks with the extra capital now?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah, Louie, thanks for the question. I'll start, I'm sure, Horacio will want to comment. I mean obviously, when we put the investment thesis in place two years ago, the world was a different place. It was different an interest rate environment, M&A market was much more robust and less political and macroeconomic risk. Strategic M&A very much remains a priority for us. It's an important tool in rounding out our ability to bring technology to mission at scale. To your question, we're getting a lot of value out of our venture investments, but they don't tend to not be at the kind of scale that you get from Liberty. So, explicitly, I would absolutely do the Liberty acquisition again. And we're looking for the next one. We've got a sizable pipeline of small- to mid-sized tuck-ins that we're prosecuting. And the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion can still accommodate a significant amount of M&A activity over the next 18 months. I think we've only deployed slightly over $1.2 billion in the first 18 months. We're going to remain patient, disciplined as always in our approach, but that we can meet the adjusted EBITDA target in the investment thesis for deploying less capital than anticipated, really is a testament to our organic performance. And it just gives us a lot of flexibility to create additional value for shareholders. So, I would not read into this any change in our strategy, it's just a reflection of where we are.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much, and good quarter. So Matt, you mentioned that you booked $1.1 billion of the $1.8 billion on the Thunderdome. What did you guys book on the $630 million Space Force award and the $1.7 billion CDC award?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah. So, Cai, I believe I said in our remarks, we booked all of the DMAC award, CDC, and I believe we booked all of the Space award as well. Thunderdome is going to be incrementally awarded. So, we only booked $1.1 billion out of the $1.85 billion there.\nCai von Rumohr: Got it. And can you comment about near-term bookings prospects? You know...\nMatt Calderone: It's always hard...\nCai von Rumohr: ...[indiscernible] big contracts still out there, or are we looking at more task orders?\nMatt Calderone: It's a combination, Cai. It's always hard to predict quarter-by-quarter, because as you know, these things can slip in terms of awards and then the protest environment creates some uncertainty. Looking ahead, I don't think we're going to have a historically stellar quarter next quarter. There are a couple of large awards that may or may not happen. We don't have a significant amount of recompete risk in the portfolio in the next 12 months. So, as you know, this is why we talk about LTM more than each individual quarter. And the LTM of almost 1.3 times, and more importantly, our qualified pipeline, which is up 35% year-over-year. Says we're really in good shape from a demand perspective.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yeah. Cai, just to give a little color on that. I've had the chance to both talk to clients about needs and talk to our team about the work that we're going after, and I would say the demand picture for technology into core mission is actually accelerating, not slowing down. And so, as Matt said, while it's almost impossible to predict bookings on any given quarter, the demand picture absent significant budget disruption is very strong.\nCai von Rumohr: Well, last year you had a 0.1 book-to-bill, so it was particularly weak. Is that going to be the norm that we get this very strong second quarter which we got this year? And then we should look for a very, very weak, near zero Q3, or is there any opportunity that Q3 could be a little bit better, clearly below 1, but better?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think that -- I'll start. I'm sure Matt will want to do color on this one. But I think on the -- first of all, I think that this quarter, the last quarter of the government fiscal year, the second quarter for Booz Allen is always the strongest because of just the way in which outlays happened and the way money is obligated through the budgeting cycle. So, that will -- that has always been the case, that continues to be. As you've seen over the last few years, the rest of the quarters are actually less predictable, because they are predicated on when will these big jobs get awarded. And that process, it really changes every year. It is really -- I would not take last year and translate it into this year directly. But as Matt said, there's a lot in the pipeline. It is over $26 billion in the pipeline. So, could some of those things hit this year, we would -- this quarter, we would like them to. But either way, we certainly have the backlog necessary to continue to grow. We have the people here to continue to grow and we have the momentum to get that done.\nMatt Calderone: Yeah, Cai, if you look...\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific.\nMatt Calderone: ...at our leading indicators and by historical measures, we're in as good a shape as we've almost ever been, right? On the demand side, we talked about not just the backlog in the book-to-bill, which is looking backwards, but the proposal pipeline looking forwards. On the supply side, at the end of the quarter, our consulting -- our clients staff headcount was up over 11%, more than 4% -- sequentially for the first half of the year, which puts us ahead of the pace that we've typically wanted to be in of 3% to 5% headcount growth. And we're managing the business really well. But there's a lot of volatility out there, right? And I think that's what we're preparing for. And that's why we built-in two to four week assumption of a partial government shutdown. Just to quantify that, before you -- we said the last shutdown of this scale which was in 2018 to 2019 cost us about $0.02 to $0.03 at the bottom-line. But that shutdown, I remember, occurred over the holidays, it was limited in scope and was at a time when we were both smaller in size in aggregate and we had a meaningful amount of time to make-up lost billing hours, which we did. So, we're assuming the impact this time will be 3 to 4 times of that. So again, put that in the context of our overall guidance, we raised top-line 4%, adjusted EBITDA 4% and EPS 3%, plus the government shutdown assumption, we're just in a great spot.\nCai von Rumohr: Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo.\nEric Yan: Yes, good morning. This is Eric Yan on for Matt. Just wondering if you see the headcount kind of shifted with FocusedFox running off. Maybe that's around end of September. I think it's about like 400 people on the program. Do you know like how many you were able to retain and shift to other work and how many are lost?\nMatt Calderone: Yeah, we've almost completely absorbed, as I said in my prepared remarks, the impact of that contract loss. There's just small team left doing mission-critical work on that contract from Booz Allen. We had about -- we said we had about 400 people on that contract. We kept more than half, and redeployed, many of them to mission-critical activities. But pulling up, we said we wanted to grow headcount 3% to 5% this year, we're at 4%, and I'm really encouraged by the numbers I'm seeing even for this quarter. So, that's why I said in the script, we're likely going to exceed the 3% to 5% range. And historically, that's been what we need to maintain our organic growth objectives.\nEric Yan: Okay, thanks. Just one more on the Section 174, with the updated guidance from IRS. Do you see an impact from that going forward?\nMatt Calderone: No.\nEric Yan: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Horacio Rozanski for closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Gigi. And thank you all for your questions and for being here this morning. I hope, Matt and I successfully conveyed how excited we are about both the momentum and the resilience we see in our business. And also of the opportunities that are ahead for our people, for our clients and for all of our investors. If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to close the call by calling out our annual innovation publication called Velocity, which is now available on our website. And this year, it's fully centered on artificial intelligence. In this year's Velocity, you get to hear from Booz Allen experts and from our industry partners on the ubiquity of AI, its transformative capabilities, how harnesses it for good, and a lot more. So, I hope you'll enjoy reading it. And we would love to hear your feedback. And on that note, thank you again for joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Today, Matt and I have the privilege of discussing with you another quarter of Booz Allen's market-leading performance. But before we get to that, I would like to open this call as I have done several times in the past, by putting our work in the context of world events. On October 7, the world was shocked by a murderous terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas on the people of Israel. We at Booz Allen, stand in mourning and solidarity with Israel, the victims, and their families. We pray for the safe return of all the hostages and would stand side by side with the U.S. government in condemnation of Hamas in support of Israel's defense and in the protection of all civilians. In the intervening weeks, Booz Allen has done what we do best. We have conducted listening sessions, creating spaces to support our colleagues in mourning or afraid for both our Israeli and Palestinian loved ones living in the region. We have launched a [Match Giving] (ph) campaign. And importantly, we have supported our U.S. client's missions. Because this is personal for me too. I have felt the warm embrace of the entire Booz Allen community. I am so proud and so grateful to each one of my colleagues for showing the best of Booz Allen at a time of crisis and loss. This morning, I felt it was important to share this with you for two reasons. First, because these horrendous events remind us of the urgency of our work, bringing leading-edge technology to critical missions, in the hope of preventing and deterring things like this from ever happening. And second, because our internal response is yet another reminder of the unique culture and people of Booz Allen. They are the unshakable foundation for our exceptional performance, decade after decade. So, turning now to performance. Our second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was outstanding. Our Booz Allen team once again delivered industry-leading organic revenue growth, a strong bottom-line and record backlog. On our last earnings call, we emphasized the importance of having a strong second quarter. Our results show we succeeded. We built resiliency in the business and enter the second half of the fiscal year with significant momentum even as the uncertainty about the federal budget persists. We now expect to exceed our original plan for this fiscal year. As a result, we are pleased to announce an increase to our top- and bottom-line guidance for fiscal year 2024. Matt will take you through it, and also deep-dive on our performance in a few minutes. My goal for today is to connect our performance with our strategy and longer-term financial objectives. We are halfway through the three-year investment thesis outlined in late 2021, and deep into the implementation of VoLT. So, this seems like a good moment to pause to take stock and to offer a self-appraisal of our progress. I'll begin by going back to what we said at our Investor Day in October 2021. At that point, we saw an extraordinary opportunity. We expected emerging technologies, such as AI, cyber, 5G and quantum to rapidly transform how our government operates over this decade. And we said our first-mover advantage positioned us to maximize this opportunity to accelerate our growth, to take our industry leadership to the next level and to drive outstanding shareholder value. At that time, we also laid out a multi-year investment thesis centered on growing adjusted EBITDA by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. We envisioned a path to accomplish this goal that included above-market organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 8% annually, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10% with continued investment capacity for future growth, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment, prioritizing small- to mid-size strategic acquisitions. Simply put, we are ahead of our expected pace at the midpoint of our investment thesis period. Our organic revenue growth of 9% in fiscal year 2023, and 15.7% in the first half of fiscal year '24 is well above the target range. And we have done this while investing in the business and maintaining margins above our original expectation. Our extraordinary organic performance has put us on a path to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target with far less capital deployment than we initially thought would be required. Today, we are pleased to reaffirm the adjusted EBITDA range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. And importantly, we expect to reach our goals while building an even stronger balance sheet. As of now, we are decreasing our baseline capital deployment expectations to $2 billion to $3.5 billion, which is approximately $1 billion less than we had initially anticipated. This provides us with the additional balance sheet capacity to create shareholder value over the next 18 months and beyond. As the world, the financial markets and the federal budget become more volatile in the coming years, we are positioning Booz Allen to serve clients with distinction, while investing in future growth avenues. These are the keys to growing and rewarding our talent and creating superior shareholder value. Moreover, these outstanding results demonstrate our VoLT growth strategy is working. VoLT stands for Velocity, Leadership and Technology. And over the past 18 months, we moved rapidly to implement. Booz Allen needed to transform itself to gain the speed and scale required to serve our clients' evolving needs. To do this, we aim to get faster in our decision-making and operations. We also set out to build and scale leading positions that transfer missions through the use of new technologies. Today, our aspirations are becoming a reality. Let me offer two examples. First, the meteoric rise of AI proves our readiness to deliver a greater speed and scale. As great power competition demands accelerated adoption of AI across every facet of the federal government, we are positioned to respond to our clients' complex needs. Earlier this month, we hosted some of you at our Helix Center for Innovation. We showed you how we are combining our exceptional talent, diverse ecosystem of innovation partners and trusted frameworks to create differentiated AI solutions. We can rapidly tailor our proven solutions to insert AI into a range of critical missions, from empowering the warfighter at the edge to improving health outcomes. And we see significant opportunities ahead to expand and deepen our impact as we continue integrating AI with other technologies. The second example of VoLT's successful implementation is how we continue to transform our existing businesses to stay at the leading-edge. We got on cyber business and our recent $1.86 billion award of Thunderdome illustrate this very well. Through this work, we combined our historical strengths in cyber tradecraft and mission understanding, with our ability to leverage key commercial technologies into scalable solutions. Thunderdome puts Booz Allen at the center of DISA's effort to implement a zero-trust architecture across the Department of Defense's complex technical infrastructure. This is a critical task, demanding all of Booz Allen's and our tech partners' talent and ingenuity. As we continue to scale this work, we expect it to create opportunities to extend elements of this solution across the whole federal government and beyond. This is VoLT in action. To close, I am extremely proud of the progress we have made towards our ambitious goals over the past 18 months. The results we share today increased Booz Allen's resilience as our market and federal budget environment grow more uncertain. We are taking our leadership position to a new level and increasing our impact across the most critical and enduring missions. The amazing people of Booz Allen work relentlessly, relentlessly on behalf of our clients and our nation. Their passion to make the world better and safer fills me with optimism about the future. It invigorates my belief that we can empower people to change the world. And with that, Matt, over to you. Good morning. Well, Mariana, it's good to hear an Argentinian accent this early in the morning and not be the only one. Well, I think, as you know from the conversations we had at Helix a couple of weeks ago, our business this year is forecasted, our AI business, in the $500 million to $700 million range and we see significant growth over the coming years. And that growth is broad-based. We talk a lot and we talk on these calls about the work we're doing in Defense, but our work Intelligence and our work across the Civil agencies on AI is also growing well. And as you saw, we have some unique solutions that are the product of our talent, some frameworks that are proprietary to Booz Allen and work we do with commercial partners to bring dual-use technology into these missions. That, I think, set us apart. So, we are very bullish about the future. To your question about budgets, clearly, we are looking very closely at what's happening on the Hill. As Matt pointed out, we are, at this point, making into our guidance the potential for a government shutdown. We hope it won't happen, but we need to be realistic about that. And we need to be realistic about the fact that, if budget compress in the future, the competition for resources across every federal agency will increase. Now having said that, from our perspective, VoLT has put us in the middle of key enduring missions where we're bringing unique capabilities and that's why we're both raising guidance and reaffirming that we're ahead of pace to deliver on our multi-year investment thesis. So, we feel really good about where we are. It's hard to predict precisely. We've tried to incorporate that in the way we -- that's why guidance is a range as opposed to -- it really is a broader range these years than it's been in the past to accommodate more scenarios. I think maybe the thing to point you to is the fact that, because budget passed last December, we saw the ability to work against a lot of latent underlying demand in the business. And that's why we're growing as well as we're growing now, and then we've had the success that we've had. I mean, this is really, I've been around for a long time, as you know, probably the best first half, I've seen at least since the IPO, possibly best first half we've had in my 30-plus years at Booz Allen. So, clearly there's momentum in the business, we're building resilience in the business in anticipation of funding challenges, but we are pedal to the metal. Sure. Let me add two small points to what Matt said, which very much resonates. One point is, if you look at the level of investment that we're putting into AI, it's relatively modest to the success that we're having. And a lot of that is because we start early on these technologies, and we wait and we plan and we position. So that the ones that go exponential, we can -- like AI has, we can stay ahead of the trend and we are still ahead of the game there and that's, that's really exciting. And then the second point, I'll point you back at the inter galactic level to the power of our single P&L, and the ability to really manage resources as an institution as opposed to in small buckets, which gave us the opportunity to flex our workforce in a way that is pretty unique to Booz Allen and that gives us all the growth that we're talking about. Hi, Sheila, good morning. I'll start, Matt might want to add. I'll say the following. When you look across the entirety of our business, Defense, Civil and Intel, 24% and 17%, 4%-plus growth while absorbing changes in the contract portfolio, it's really broad-based. We are hitting on all cylinders across all of these. It's not one program, it's not one piece, it's not one dynamic. I think, in general, it's attributable to VoLT. VoLT is giving us both momentum and resiliency. The momentum is evident in the numbers, and in the fact that we're raising guidance while accounting for the potential for a government shutdown. And the resiliency is equally important, because to your point, I mean, we do see increased uncertainty in the funding picture. At this point, we continue to see clients moving aggressively against our key priorities in other cycles like this. We have seen clients maybe pull back in anticipation. And perhaps it's because of the missions we support, perhaps it's because of the geopolitical dynamics and the uniqueness of our offerings that we're still seeing that. But we are both growing fast and running tightly so that we can create the environment in which we can continue to both invest and protect our workforce if the budgets get tight or get interrupted for a period of time. So, we're excited about where we are across all the markets, in Defense, in particular. Like I said, I mean, every part of our Defense business is growing nicely. It's the only way to get to 24%, and it has really transformed to grow along the lines of bringing technology to mission. Good morning. Yeah. Cai, just to give a little color on that. I've had the chance to both talk to clients about needs and talk to our team about the work that we're going after, and I would say the demand picture for technology into core mission is actually accelerating, not slowing down. And so, as Matt said, while it's almost impossible to predict bookings on any given quarter, the demand picture absent significant budget disruption is very strong. I think that -- I'll start. I'm sure Matt will want to do color on this one. But I think on the -- first of all, I think that this quarter, the last quarter of the government fiscal year, the second quarter for Booz Allen is always the strongest because of just the way in which outlays happened and the way money is obligated through the budgeting cycle. So, that will -- that has always been the case, that continues to be. As you've seen over the last few years, the rest of the quarters are actually less predictable, because they are predicated on when will these big jobs get awarded. And that process, it really changes every year. It is really -- I would not take last year and translate it into this year directly. But as Matt said, there's a lot in the pipeline. It is over $26 billion in the pipeline. So, could some of those things hit this year, we would -- this quarter, we would like them to. But either way, we certainly have the backlog necessary to continue to grow. We have the people here to continue to grow and we have the momentum to get that done. Thank you, Gigi. And thank you all for your questions and for being here this morning. I hope, Matt and I successfully conveyed how excited we are about both the momentum and the resilience we see in our business. And also of the opportunities that are ahead for our people, for our clients and for all of our investors. If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'd like to close the call by calling out our annual innovation publication called Velocity, which is now available on our website. And this year, it's fully centered on artificial intelligence. In this year's Velocity, you get to hear from Booz Allen experts and from our industry partners on the ubiquity of AI, its transformative capabilities, how harnesses it for good, and a lot more. So, I hope you'll enjoy reading it. And we would love to hear your feedback. And on that note, thank you again for joining, and have a great day."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and thanks to all of you for joining our call. The Booz Allen team delivered another exceptional quarter. Our success across the portfolio in shaping demand and capturing opportunities, in hiring and deploying talent onto contracts, and most important, in serving our clients' mission sets us up very well for the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond. Booz Allen prides itself on delivering for our clients, our people and our shareholders, quarter after quarter and year after year. We are proud to be in a position today to raise our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Our team continues to build both momentum and resiliency for the long-term. And as Horacio noted, we are ahead of where we expect it to be against the adjusted EBITDA dollar goal in our three-year investment thesis. Now, let's dive into the specifics of our second quarter performance. Please turn to Slide 6. Total revenue for the quarter grew 16% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 14.8% year-over-year. Revenue excluding billable expenses increased 14.1% year-over-year to approximately $1.8 billion. Our exceptional top-line performance continues to be driven by strong demand for our services and solutions and steady headcount growth. Our business continues to exhibit strength across the portfolio. Across all markets, we are seeing the results of our leaders embracing the VoLT strategy. Our Defense business is driving, with revenue up approximately 24% compared to the second quarter of last fiscal year. Growth in this market is broad-based. We continue to bring technology and tradecraft to critical national missions. Our Civil business revenue was up roughly 17% year-over-year, with strong performance across the board. Our Intelligence business grew 4% year-over-year and has almost entirely absorbed the roll-off of a large classified contract. We had a number of significant new wins in the first half of the year and are very encouraged by the progress our leaders have made and hiring clear talent and evolving this portfolio. Finally, our Global Commercial business, which accounted for 1% of revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 45% year-over-year, reflecting the divestiture disclosed last fiscal year. Moving onto bookings. The award environment remains robust. The second quarter is historically our strongest for bookings. This quarter, net bookings totaled approximately $6.4 billion. This includes $1.1 billion of the $1.86 billion Thunderdome contract award, and the full value of the recently awarded $1.6 billion DMAC contract. Our second quarter book-to-bill was 2.41 times, in-line with the same-period a year-ago. And our trailing 12 month book-to-bill was 1.29 times. Total backlog as of September 30, grew to a record $35 billion, up 10.1% year-over-year. Funded backlog increased 14.7% to $6.3 billion. Unfunded backlog dipped 2.4% to $10.1 billion, and priced options grew 16.6% to $18.6 billion. Looking forward, we continue to execute on a rich pipeline of opportunities. Our fiscal year 2024 qualified pipeline is up 35% compared to this time last year and stands at $26.2 billion. In sum, we have both the award and the pipeline to support our near-term and medium-term growth objectives. Turning now to headcount, Booz Allen grew to more than 33,000 people strong at the end of September. Client staff headcount was 11.2% higher on a year-over-year basis. Total headcount increased 10.3%. Hiring, onboarding and deploying talent onto contracts continues to be a top priority. These efforts have yielded a 4% increase in client staff since the beginning of the fiscal year, and we remain in a growth posture. Therefore, today, we are well-positioned to exceed our full year target of 3% to 5% client staff headcount growth. Moving now to the bottom-line. We earned $291 million in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. This is 1.6% higher than the second quarter last year and in-line with our expectations for the quarter. Our principal focus remains on EBITDA dollar growth. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.9% was approximately 150 basis points lower than the same period a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, margins in the quarter were diluted by a higher billable expense ratio and a small shift in contract mix towards cost-reimbursable work due to the rapid growth in our Defense business. We continue to manage costs and execute contracts exceptionally well, which allows us to both deliver financial results in the near term and invest for the long term. This year, we do expect a slightly flatter pattern of quarterly margins compared to recent years. Second quarter net income was roughly flat year-over-year at $171 million. This was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted net income declined 4.9% year-over-year to $169 million. Diluted earnings per share grew 0.8% year-over-year to $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 3.7% year-over-year to $1.29. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with $557 million of cash on hand. This includes proceeds from the successful investment-grade bond offering that we executed in August. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $64.3 million. The result of $47.4 million used for operating activities, and $16.9 million of CapEx. Note that in July, we paid out the previously discussed settlement with the Department of Justice. Excluding that payment, operating cash flow was up almost 12% year-over-year. Collections were solid for the quarter, but cash outflows remained high due to our rapid growth and continued investments in the business. Our net debt at the end of the second quarter was approximately $2.9 billion. And our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.7 times adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 8. During the second quarter, we returned approximately $143 million of capital to shareholders. This included approximately $81 million in share repurchases at an average price of $116.98 per share and $62 million in quarterly cash dividends. Today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share, that will be payable on December 4, to stockholders of record as of November 15. As Horacio noted, September 30 marked both the midpoint of our current fiscal year and the halfway point of our three-year investment thesis. Our leadership team could not be prouder of our performance to-date. On our last call, we highlighted three things that would be key to our full year performance: second quarter bookings, second quarter headcount growth, and the potential for a government shutdown. Our bookings and headcount growth in the quarter exceeded expectations, but there is still uncertainty about government funding beyond November. Thus, our updated guidance incorporates both the momentum we have built and the strong possibility of a multi-week government shutdown. We have built the assumption of a two to four week partial government shutdown into our guidance ranges. On this front, we continue to hope for certainty, but plan for volatility. It is significant that we are raising full year guidance even with this assumption of a multi-week partial government shutdown. Let me now take you through our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance. Please turn to Slide 9. At the top-line, we now expect revenue growth of 11% to 14%. 10% to 13% of which will be organic. And we do expect billable expenses will decline in the second half. Our adjusted EBITDA margin guidance is unchanged. We still expect margins to be in the high 10% to 11% range. As I noted earlier, we anticipate our margin profile for the full year will be flatter than it has been in recent years, even with our traditional ramp-up of investment in talent and capability building in the second half. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA dollar guidance to between $1.115 billion and $1.145 billion, or approximately 10% to 13% growth year-over-year. We are increasing our ADEPS guidance to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 per share. We are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at between $160 million and $260 million. This includes the impact of higher interest payments, connected to our recent bond issuance. We now expect CapEx of approximately $85 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $75 million to $175 million. In sum, our business is strong and our VoLT strategy is working. Our management team is excited about the momentum we feel, the great work we're doing, and the value we're creating for our people, our clients, and our investors. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Yeah, Bert, I'll take it first. Look, I think we showed you, as you said -- we arranged the business from a revenue perspective and told you how many AI practitioners we have. But it's purely apples to apples, because we have AI practitioners that are supporting non-AI projects and vice-versa. Our AI folks are probably less utilized than the rest of the business because we are investing a significant amount in that business. There are a lot of folks who are building capabilities, supporting innovation, driving our AI governance model, et cetera. But we see significant growth there not just from those staff but from a broader set of staff that we're training and upskilling from a technology perspective. The other thing, I'll mention, it's relevant both to your question and to Mariana's is we also highlighted at the [AI end event] (ph), the extent to which AI is now being bundled into large procurements. And the success we're having when that in fact happens. Increasingly, we're seeing, not just for AI, but for Cyber, for Digital, for some of the hardware engineering and integration that we do that is bundled together, because if you think about our complex mission problem, it requires AI to enable it, Cyber to protect it, you've got to integrate it into a software and network system, oftentimes it has to be integrated into some type of hardware product. So, I wouldn't just think about AI from a traditional perspective. It really is having a much broader impact across the base of our business and is being integrated into the technology stacks we have writ large. It could generate more margins, but really this has been intentional over the past few years. We're shifting cost and investment from the infrastructure into the business. I mean, as Horacio said, relative to some of the hyperscalers, our investment in AI is modest, but we're investing a lot of money there. So, it has been a very intentional structured effort led by all of our business leaders to become as efficient as possible on the corporate side so we can invest in the business and in growth and in the capabilities our clients want. Yeah. Sheila... Obviously, 10% to 15% organic growth for the year, we're growing above market, clearly. But as Horacio said, it's the quality of the underlying growth and the depths of that, that really has us excited, because it gives us not just momentum but the resiliency to write out potential dislocation from a budgetary environment. Sure. I'll take that in a couple of parts. First, and we've talked about the puts and takes on cash for a couple of calls now. On the positive side, we're certainly generating more profit, our CapEx has declined, and we've improved collections. But there are headwinds. The DoD settlement, obviously, higher cash taxes, driven by our growth in 174, higher interest expense. And as you mentioned, our outsized growth, we are consuming working capital to support it. I mean, just to give you one example, we're required to pay small businesses within 30 days. And so, as we're growing, we're typically paying them faster than we're collecting. With respect to our outstanding receivable balance, I think you're getting at the question of some of the unbilled receivables on our balance sheet, because you've asked that previously. We are working -- a meaningful portion of that is tied up with -- in past-year audits. We are working with DCAA, DCMA, both well and quickly to try to resolve that. It's going to be likely a multi-year process, but things are going well. And at this time, we have no ability to project what's -- when and how that will be resolved. Yes. I mean, that, in particular, has to do with -- it changed our reg reserve we made relative to our '22 audit and the results of '22 audit, but there are going to be puts and takes over the next couple of quarters, and a couple years as we work to resolve these. So, it was a positive this quarter, we're not making any predictions about future quarters. Hello, Louie. Yeah, Louie, thanks for the question. I'll start, I'm sure, Horacio will want to comment. I mean obviously, when we put the investment thesis in place two years ago, the world was a different place. It was different an interest rate environment, M&A market was much more robust and less political and macroeconomic risk. Strategic M&A very much remains a priority for us. It's an important tool in rounding out our ability to bring technology to mission at scale. To your question, we're getting a lot of value out of our venture investments, but they don't tend to not be at the kind of scale that you get from Liberty. So, explicitly, I would absolutely do the Liberty acquisition again. And we're looking for the next one. We've got a sizable pipeline of small- to mid-sized tuck-ins that we're prosecuting. And the range of $2 billion to $3.5 billion can still accommodate a significant amount of M&A activity over the next 18 months. I think we've only deployed slightly over $1.2 billion in the first 18 months. We're going to remain patient, disciplined as always in our approach, but that we can meet the adjusted EBITDA target in the investment thesis for deploying less capital than anticipated, really is a testament to our organic performance. And it just gives us a lot of flexibility to create additional value for shareholders. So, I would not read into this any change in our strategy, it's just a reflection of where we are. Yeah. So, Cai, I believe I said in our remarks, we booked all of the DMAC award, CDC, and I believe we booked all of the Space award as well. Thunderdome is going to be incrementally awarded. So, we only booked $1.1 billion out of the $1.85 billion there. It's always hard... It's a combination, Cai. It's always hard to predict quarter-by-quarter, because as you know, these things can slip in terms of awards and then the protest environment creates some uncertainty. Looking ahead, I don't think we're going to have a historically stellar quarter next quarter. There are a couple of large awards that may or may not happen. We don't have a significant amount of recompete risk in the portfolio in the next 12 months. So, as you know, this is why we talk about LTM more than each individual quarter. And the LTM of almost 1.3 times, and more importantly, our qualified pipeline, which is up 35% year-over-year. Says we're really in good shape from a demand perspective. Yeah, Cai, if you look... ...at our leading indicators and by historical measures, we're in as good a shape as we've almost ever been, right? On the demand side, we talked about not just the backlog in the book-to-bill, which is looking backwards, but the proposal pipeline looking forwards. On the supply side, at the end of the quarter, our consulting -- our clients staff headcount was up over 11%, more than 4% -- sequentially for the first half of the year, which puts us ahead of the pace that we've typically wanted to be in of 3% to 5% headcount growth. And we're managing the business really well. But there's a lot of volatility out there, right? And I think that's what we're preparing for. And that's why we built-in two to four week assumption of a partial government shutdown. Just to quantify that, before you -- we said the last shutdown of this scale which was in 2018 to 2019 cost us about $0.02 to $0.03 at the bottom-line. But that shutdown, I remember, occurred over the holidays, it was limited in scope and was at a time when we were both smaller in size in aggregate and we had a meaningful amount of time to make-up lost billing hours, which we did. So, we're assuming the impact this time will be 3 to 4 times of that. So again, put that in the context of our overall guidance, we raised top-line 4%, adjusted EBITDA 4% and EPS 3%, plus the government shutdown assumption, we're just in a great spot. Yeah, we've almost completely absorbed, as I said in my prepared remarks, the impact of that contract loss. There's just small team left doing mission-critical work on that contract from Booz Allen. We had about -- we said we had about 400 people on that contract. We kept more than half, and redeployed, many of them to mission-critical activities. But pulling up, we said we wanted to grow headcount 3% to 5% this year, we're at 4%, and I'm really encouraged by the numbers I'm seeing even for this quarter. So, that's why I said in the script, we're likely going to exceed the 3% to 5% range. And historically, that's been what we need to maintain our organic growth objectives. No."

        "content": "Nathan Rutledge: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Booz Allen's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release we issued earlier this morning. We have also provided presentation slides on our website and are now on Slide 2. With me today to talk about our business and financial performance are Horacio Rozanski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Calderone, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As shown on the disclaimer on Slide 3, please keep in mind that some of the items we will discuss this morning are forward-looking and may relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from forecasted results discussed in our SEC filings and on this call. All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements and speak only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include an explanation of adjustments and other reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures in our first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release and slides. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO and President, Horacio Rozanski. We are now on Slide 4.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. This morning, Matt and I are excited to share outstanding financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our business is performing extremely well across all metrics. In the first quarter, revenue grew 18% year-over-year, with industry-leading organic growth. The bottom line was exceptional, and our headcount grew at a record pace to more than 32,000 Booz Allen employees. I believe these numbers speak for themselves. I could not be more proud of our people for delivering a truly tremendous first quarter, as we advance our VoLT strategy and serve our clients' most critical missions. This morning, I will put the results in context of our investment thesis and current year outlook. Then I'll discuss how our people and culture are foundational to our sustained performance. And later, Matt will cover the first quarter results and expectations for the full fiscal year in depth. Before I go on, as you know, on July 21, we announced settlement of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil investigation into highly technical elements of our government cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices. The settlement is within the expected range we previously disclosed in our fourth quarter earnings in May and has been factored into our updated cash guidance. We believe the company acted lawfully and responsibly. The settlement provides certainty to our employees, clients and shareholders and allows us to return to regular order with the important work of our DCMA and DCAA regulators. And yesterday, the SEC informed us that they had concluded their investigation into Booz Allen. Returning to this quarter's performance. As always, - it is important to view our latest results in the context of long-term objectives. Our multiyear investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA and to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We have said we expect to achieve that goal through a combination of above-market organic revenue growth, strong and stable margins with capacity to invest in our people and capabilities and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. Our first quarter results demonstrate we are on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target. We have excellent momentum and remain above expectations on organic growth and profit. While strategic acquisitions continue to be a priority, our pipeline of opportunities is more limited than we expected. On balance, this probably means that we will reach our multiyear targets through greater organic contribution while simultaneously retaining increased flexibility to deploy capital in response to market conditions. Shifting to our current fiscal year's expectations. On our May earnings call, we described the growth pattern for the year as a strong first half with less certainty in the second half. At that time, the debt ceiling and federal budget negotiations were ongoing. As a result, we outlined guidance that reflected our momentum and the range of federal funding scenarios after September 30. We also said we expected to start the year at or above the top end of our revenue guidance. One quarter end, our performance is ahead of the expectations we set in May. Demand for our services and solutions, combined with record headcount growth continue to fuel our momentum. While we're pleased that Congress raised a debt ceiling in June, significant uncertainty still remains about the budget for the government's next fiscal year. For us, the key to achieving and exceeding our expectations is our success in selling and starting work before September 30. That was our premise going into the year. It remains our top priority, given the potential for protracted federal budget negotiations. Transitioning to a longer-term view. Over the last three earnings calls, I discussed the three key dimensions of our VoLT strategy, velocity, leadership and technology. Booz Allen's extraordinary team of leaders and colleagues have achieved significant progress in all three dimensions. And perhaps one of the best indicators of our progress is the headcount growth we have experienced in the last four quarters. Therefore, today, I would like to spend a few moments sharing some insights into our people and culture. First of all, credit for our hiring momentum goes to our leaders and team. While it is true that the hiring market is less frantic than a year ago, our record hiring goes well beyond that. Over the past year, our business and recruiting leaders work together to transform our talent acquisition processes. We have streamlined the hiring life cycle and made meaningful improvements to the experience of becoming a new Booz Allen employee. Together, these outcomes set us up well to efficiently hire at speed and scale. Second, I firmly believe we have an industry-leading employee value proposition. We care for our people, and we invest in our people. That means we continuously seek to understand what our employees need to thrive in their lives and careers. And then we align our actions, policies and benefits accordingly. This level of responsiveness was evident in the bold actions we took to protect the health and safety of all our people throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And today, we continue to respond to the evolving personal and professional needs of our talent. Here are some examples. From a well-being perspective, we have expanded our mental health resources, created new wellness incentives and offer greater access to services and treatments at a time of nationwide shortages. We also know learning and professional development are important to our employees, particularly as technological change accelerates. Through our technically focused employee groups, boot camps and upskilling programs, we empower our highly technical workforce to stay on the leading edge. For example, our AI training programs offer a progressive learning journey from basic AI literacy through expert proficiency. This provides all of our employees with the opportunity to hone their skills and thrive as they serve our clients' pressing needs. We have also taken the best of what we've learned in recent years to provide new ways of working that offer more flexibility. And we are investing in leadership development to foster a culture that optimizes performance and strengthens belonging as we grow in a hybrid work environment. Ultimately, people thriving in our culture are at the heart of our sustained growth quarter after quarter. Across the firm, our diverse talent unite around our purpose and live our values, as they contribute to something bigger than themselves. We have veterans, clinicians and technologists working together to help improve access to benefits across the VA. Scientists and digital architects, collaborating and innovating to make climate resilience a reality. Intel and cyber experts working around the clock to secure our homeland, cross-functional teams of data scientists, ethicists, mission experts and physicists using emerging technologies like generative AI and quantum as a force for good. And employees giving back by bringing STEM indication to youth in underserved communities. In sum, we work hard every day to make Booz Allen a place of empowerment, opportunity, accountability and belonging, a place where each person can reach her or his full potential and change the world. Our amazing people, empowered by our unique culture are the reason our strategy works, our results are repeatable and we create sustainable shareholder value. And this is why on these quarterly earnings calls, Matt and I are so proud, so proud to represent the incredible work of the over 32,000 Booz Allen employees. And with that, Matt, over to you.\nMatt Calderone: Thank you, Horacio, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As Horacio noted, we are extremely pleased with our start to the fiscal year. Given the momentum in our business, we anticipated that we would come out of the gate strong. On our last call, I indicated that our first quarter growth would be at or above the top end of our guided range. As these numbers demonstrate, our team exceeded these expectations. Thus, while it is early in the year and significant funding uncertainty remains, we are very well positioned against our fiscal 2024 guidance, and we remain on track to deliver on our multiyear investment thesis objectives. Now, please turn to Slide 6 as I cover our first quarter results in detail. Total revenue for the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 16.7% year-over-year, including double-digit growth across all of our federal markets. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 16.9% to approximately $1.8 billion. This is our strongest growth quarter since we went public in 2010. Our VoLT strategy has positioned us well in areas that are primed for long-term growth. Our Defense business continued to accelerate in the first quarter, with revenue increasing approximately 19% year-over-year. In Defense, we remain focused on bringing differentiated scaled solutions to the war fighting mission. In Civil, revenue was up approximately 20% year-over-year. We continue to position ourselves as a critical partner in the federal digital transformation. Our Intelligence business grew by approximately 18% year-over-year, including several exciting new wins and a healthy pipeline of opportunities. We continue to expect the pace of revenue growth in Intel to slow over the balance of the fiscal year due to challenging year-over-year comps and the roll-off of a large classified contract. Finally, our global commercial business, which accounted for 2% of revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 23% year-over-year. This reflects the sale of MENA and Managed Threat services businesses in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2023. Turning now to headcount. As of June 30, Booz Allen had more than 32,000 people working directly and indirectly in support of our clients' missions. We had a record-setting 12.5% annual increase in client staff. This is the result of continued hiring to meet demand, a more efficient talent acquisition process and enhanced value proposition. Total headcount inclusive of corporate staff, increased 11.2%. Attrition remains well below historical levels. While we very much remain in a growth posture, we do anticipate headcount growth to moderate in comparison to the brisk pace we set last fiscal year. Pivoting to demand, we still see a strong pace in volume of award activity. Net bookings for the first quarter were approximately $2.7 billion. This translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.03 times, an improvement from 0.72 times in the prior year quarter. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill as of June 30 was 1.24 times, in line with our current growth expectations. Total backlog was up approximately 9.3% year-over-year to $31.3 billion. Funded backlog grew 22% to $4.9 billion, unfunded backlog fell 9.5% to $9 billion and priced options grew 18.6% to $17.3 billion. Looking forward, our qualified pipeline of $41.9 billion is up approximately 12% compared to this time last year. With this pipeline and backlog, we believe we can continue to convert strong demand into industry-leading organic growth. Moving now to the bottom line. We earned $307 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, up 21.5% from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% was approximately 40 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. This was a function of our overall growth, strong contract-level performance and efforts to operate the business more efficiently. First quarter net income increased 16.9% year-over-year to $161 million. Adjusted net income grew 28% year-over-year to $193 million. This excluded the incremental legal reserve of approximately $28 million recorded in the first quarter in connection with the now settled DOJ matter. Diluted earnings per share grew 18.4% year-over-year to $1.22. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the incremental reserve, grew 30.1% year-over-year to $1.47. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $210 million of cash on hand. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $82 million, the result of $71.5 million of cash used for operating activities and $10.5 million of CapEx. This was in line with our expectations as the first quarter is typically our low point in cash flow for the year. Operating cash was seasonally light due to the timing of bonus payouts but was aided by strong collections in overall revenue growth. We continue to spend on strategic investments and use working capital to support our outsized growth. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.7 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample capacity to generate strong future cash flow and to deploy capital to drive additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 8. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $175 million of capital to shareholders. This included $63 million in quarterly cash dividends and approximately $112 million in share repurchases at an average price of $96.04 [ph] per share. On capital deployment, we are staying patient and disciplined as we navigate macroeconomic conditions, budget uncertainty and a challenging M&A environment. Strategic acquisitions remain a key part of our investment thesis, and we continue to focus on finding small- to medium-sized tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our VoLT strategy, act as accelerants to growth, create new pathways for client value and meet our financial parameters. Finally, today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share that will be payable on August 31 to stockholders of record as of August 15. Turning now to our full year fiscal outlook. Please go to Slide 9. Last quarter, we set annual guidance ranges that anticipated an aggressive first half, followed by a more conservative second half. We noted this was due to macroeconomic and budget uncertainty, the pattern of prior year comparable performance and a typical first half second half pattern in our business. These dynamics have not changed and it is still early in our fiscal year. Today, I will give you a little more color on the three factors I indicated will determine where we fall within our guidance range. First, the budget environment. While the recent debt ceiling agreement took certain worst-case scenarios off the table, the timing and nature of fiscal 2024 federal appropriations are still unclear. Second, our conversion of demand. The second quarter is typically our strongest in terms of bookings. As Horacio noted, it is especially crucial this year. Leading up to the government's fiscal year-end, there is a big ramp in tactical selling, bids and proposals. Our entire team is focused on staying ahead of pace so that we add to our backlog and efficiently start work on new or extended contracts across our portfolio. The third factor is the timing and pace of headcount growth. The net hedge we added in the first quarter give us confidence we will meet our target of adding 3% to 5% client staff this fiscal year. In addition, we are still assessing certain aspects of the financial impact of the settlement with the Department of Justice, apart from the impact on our operating cash flow, which I will walk you through shortly. We expect to see a modest increase to our full fiscal year interest expense and a modest decrease in our provision for income tax expense and adjusted EBITDA. Given our exceptional first quarter performance, we are confident about our outlook. Other than cash, we are not updating guidance at this time. As a reminder, our full year fiscal guidance is as follows, at the top line, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 11%, 6% to 10%, of which will be organic. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 10% to 11% range. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA dollar range of between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion or approximately 6% to 9% growth year-over-year. Our ADEPS guidance range is between $4.80 and $4.95 per share. For our updated cash guidance, we now expect operating cash flow of between $160 million and $260 million. This reflects an estimated net impact of $340 million related to our settlement with the Department of Justice, inclusive of expected tax and interest impacts. In closing, I am extremely proud of our first quarter results and confident that we can build on the success. We have the right strategy, and more importantly, we have the right people. Our stellar first quarter results are a direct product of their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Horacio and Matt. Thank you so much.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning, Sheila.\nMatt Calderone: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Morning. I don't know if you guys are going to like my question here, but obviously, stellar results on the revenue and profit line. So nothing to talk about there. But I just wanted to ask about the DOJ settlement. And how you think about -- Matt, you mentioned some comments about the fiscal '24 guide. But aside from that, do you think it impacted your ability to win business? It doesn't seem like it from the organic growth you've put up, but how do you think it's impacted your business or cash generation over the last few years?\nHoracio Rozanski: Thanks for the question, Sheila. I mean the specific answer to your question is we remain very close to our clients. We connect with them all the time. We've been very transparent throughout about all of these and our clients understand it and have put it into context. So I don't believe, and I think the numbers would bear out that this has affected our ability to win business or to execute our business, and we're now able to look ahead. I mean, I think to put the whole thing in context, we just had a record quarter. We're extremely pleased with that. And I think it is a reflection in some ways of how much upside there is in our business when we have a stable environment on the labor side and on the funding side. I think there's two underlying drivers there. The first one, which I spoke to in the prepared remarks is, of course, our people who are at the heart of everything. And the second is that for over a decade, from Vision 2020 now to VoLT, we've been positioning against key issues that matter to our clients the most. I've talked in recent calls about China. I've talked about AI where you're going to see us talk more about Quantum and other things coming forward. And so that's how we're seeing the business. We're looking ahead. We're excited and optimistic. And we love this virtuous circle that we can create when amazing people do great work, clients ask for more. So we grow that allows us to invest in attracting more amazing people and then building new capabilities and the like. So that's - hopefully, that answers your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Yes. No, super helpful.\nMatt Calderone: I was going to answer the cash portion of your question, Sheila. As Horacio said, we are very much looking forward to getting back to normal course with our DCMA and DCA colleagues. And over time, I do believe that we'll have a benefit to our cash performance. As you others have noted, there is a meaningful unbilled sitting on our balance sheet right now, and we look forward to working with our regulators to work through outstanding audits and get back to normal course.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. And I just wanted to ask about Civil as well. I mean it continues to lead growth of 20% off of a double-digit comp. So we got to see Helix, is there any one particular program driving that growth? Or is that just your AI capabilities coming through? If you could talk about that a bit.\nHoracio Rozanski: Sure. I'll start. What's powered the Civil growth now for several years is the emphasis on digital transformation across multiple civil agencies, a lot of emphasis on the health agencies, not just the VA but also CDC, NIH, CMS and the like. And so - that continues to be a big growth engine. We're seeing really at this point, growth across our entire civil portfolio really driven, first of it was cloud and digital transformation. We're now seeing more demand for cyber for AI. And all of that comes together because we bring both the mission and the technology aspects together in ways that our clients value and we believe nobody else can.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. And our next question coming from the line of Bert Subin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBert Subin: Good morning.\nHoracio Rozanski: Good morning.\nBert Subin: Hey, Horacio, just following up to your comments there, you said you're seeing more interest in AI on the Civil side. As we think about your comments from last earnings call, have you seen any marked change in AI interest from customers? And if so, where is that coming from? Is it Civil, Intel, Defense or some combination?\nHoracio Rozanski: I think the short form of the answer is all of the above. This is a topic that, as you know, we've been investing in and thinking about for years. At the beginning, there was sort of, I'll call it more curiosity than interest, then you turn to interest, then it turn into demand. Our AI team is growing extraordinarily fast. And it's - this is permeating really the entirety of our business, I can't say this with absolute precision, but essentially, all of our largest contracts have some form of AI in scope or the possibility for AI in scope, I don't think our visionary clients who write a 5 or a 10-year contract now that does not include these capabilities because we all know they're transformational. And Booz Allen, I'm proud to say, is at the forefront.\nBert Subin: Great. And just following up, Matt, to some of your comments there around guidance. You achieved 30% of the midpoint of your FY '24 ADEPS guide in the first quarter which compares to 25% last year. As you mentioned, sort of those three items, which of those are you most focused on to hitting or beating your guide? Is it mainly the bookings side this quarter as you lose the Intel contract later in the year? Or are there other discrete headwinds you're watching?\nMatt Calderone: Yes, I'll pick two of the three. It certainly Q2 sales is critical. It's - as we said in the script, it's important every year, particularly this year, given the second item I'll highlight, which is the funding uncertainty. And really, our Q2 sets us up not just for this fiscal year but for next fiscal year as well. And that's what we're trying to do, not just on the bookings side, but obviously, with headcount as well as produce the year-over-year organic growth that we desire and our investors expect.\nBert Subin: Great. Thank you, Matt, and thank you, Horacio.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMatt Akers: Thanks for the question. Good morning. I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about capital deployment kind of as we go through this year, obviously, the settlement is a little bit of a drag on cash and how you think about maybe balancing that with maybe using the balance sheet to continue repurchases?\nMatt Calderone: Yes, Matt, I'll start and Horacio may add to it. Certainly, it's a significant payment. So of course, it has an impact. But that said, we're still very much committed to using the balance sheet to drive incremental strategic and financial value. We have the balance sheet strength to do that and organic performance on the EBITDA side certainly fortifies that. Strategic acquisitions remain our priority. But as we've said, that [ph] market remains challenging. We're leaning into it. We've got a good pipeline that we're prosecuting, but deals are harder to consummate. I'm sure you've heard, not just from us, but from others that a lot of deals are dying at the finish line, but we're going to continue to lead into it. That said, we have the flexibility to deploy capital in other ways, it's appropriate to create shareholder value. And I think you saw that last quarter, we bought back a lot of shares.\nMatt Akers: Great. Thanks. I leave it there. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRobert Spingarn: Thanks. Good morning. Horacio, we talk about AI all the time. It's already come up a bit on this call. How are you using AI internally to improve the cost structure or wherever else you can apply it at Booz?\nHoracio Rozanski: I appreciate that question. And this has been an actual -- a fair amount of discussion internally because it's important to us. Our clients ask us the same question. And so we are looking for the highest opportunity areas where AI would have the most leverage to our business. And the obvious one is talent acquisition. And so we began by using a somebody else's tool that we purpose into our environment to go through all of our requisitions and make sure that it essentially read all the requisitions for bias language for things that we didn't want to have in there and to make us be the right kind of face to the market. And we've now moved into another phase, which is for matching. As you know, we have thousands of open requisitions at all times. They change all the time. We have hundreds of thousands of resumes coming in. We have 32,000 people internally who want to expand what they know in their career. And AI is an extraordinary tool to do that. We have something in prototype that is showing tremendous upside. And I think it's going to be really the next wave of our value proposition to really help our people understand this is where I want my career to go, what kinds of opportunities are out there that get me there? What kind of training do I need to have to connect into those opportunities and be qualified to do it that there's a ton of upside there. And then beyond that, as you can imagine, every aspect of our business, we need to think through. And again, we're prioritizing high leverage areas first.\nRobert Spingarn: Thank you. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the award environment as we look out through the year, I think you talked about Intel coming down. But are there any major recompetes that we should be aware of that might point you to the low end or the high end of your range and at the same time, any big opportunities that we should be on the lookout for?\nHoracio Rozanski: It's the answer I guess would be yes on both sides of it. Our portfolio, as you've known us for a long time, it used to be so many small contracts and very few large ones. And now the portfolio has still a lot of small contracts and a lot of small task orders into the thousands and a significant share of really large programs. On the large program side, we - those when they get recompeted, each - any one of those can move the needle some. What we're seeing there is that recompetes come in generally a larger scope and even larger ceiling than the original programs. So that's obviously a source of upside, and it's a source of increased competition because they attract more attention. And our pipeline is rich. We have a good number of recompetes over the next 12 to 18 months. We have a very good number of things were going at that are either new or potential takeaways. And all in all, we're optimistic about where we are and how we're positioned.\nRobert Spingarn: Something specifically...\nHoracio Rozanski: In addition to what we're seeing from a book-to-bill perspective, we're seeing significant demand from inside existing contracts, particularly in our Civil business. So that's a dynamic that as we produce a tremendous value for clients, we're seeing additional tasking on existing contracts at a pace, quite frankly, we haven't seen in the past.\nRobert Spingarn: Okay. So there's nothing specific either of you would call out, though?\nHoracio Rozanski: There's large contracts being competed all the time. We have a couple of large contracts in health that are up for competition. We have a couple of large contracts in our Defense business they are up for recompete. And obviously, we're tracking those very closely. We're well positioned if we lost any of those. Obviously, that would not be good. But at the same time, where we have a number of very large, very exciting contracts that were awaiting word on and so forth. So -- on balance, as we think about the business, we think about contract vehicles, obviously, they're important, but we think about them as a means to an end and the end is to really serve the mission. And to create overlap between these contracts when we can so that we are actually well positioned to continue to serve a mission if we lose part of the scope because of a contract going away, if we win something our commitment is to the mission and to continue to grow into the missions that matter.\nRobert Spingarn: Right. Well, you've certainly managed it well so far. Thanks for the color.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Your line is open.\nCai von Rumohr: Hello. So I'm a little confused. Your headcount went up 2% in the quarter. That's an almost unprecedented first quarter increase. And the top end of your guide assumes that revenues over the next three quarters will average $110 million less than the first quarter. And per your 10-K focus Fox [ph] was only about $55 million to $60 million a quarter run rate. So it looks like either you have too many people on board or your revenue guide has to come up?\nMatt Calderone: Cai, I'll take that one. Look, we had an exceptional Q1. We knew it was going to be strong. And as both Horacio and I said, it exceeded expectations, and it positions us very, very well within our guided range. And we are seeing, as Horacio said, significant momentum in the business across all three sectors on both the supply and demand side. It is early. We do want to see how Q2 plays out. There is, as you know, significant uncertainty in the funding environment that remains. And as I'm sure you know, our comps do get harder. We've generated 2% to 3% headcount growth each quarter for the last quarter, four quarters, which is really unprecedented. We're not going to replicate that. Utilization spiked in Q2, Q3, we added ever watch. There are a handful of reasons why I think the year-over-year comps get more challenging. But none of this should take away from the underlying momentum that we see. We're just going to see the pace of growth moderate some over the back half.\nHoracio Rozanski: Yes, Cai, just to be very specific, we have not over hired. Our team is fully utilized, and we are leaning forward.\nCai von Rumohr: Great. And the second one is now that the DOJ uncertainty is behind you. Any thoughts about kind of taking on some more permanent debt and reducing the exposure of the term?\nMatt Calderone: Cai, we're always looking at opportunities to revise our capital structure.\nCai von Rumohr: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Your line is open.\nHoracio Rozanski -: Hi, Louis. Good morning. We can hear you.\nOperator: Louis, your line is open. Your might be on mute. Sorry, you might be having some cell phone issue. I'm not showing any further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Rozanski for any closing remarks.\nHoracio Rozanski: Thank you very much, and thank you all for your questions and for taking the time to join us this morning. As we close today, I'd like to once again recognize this incredible Booz Allen team. They are the reason that I feel so optimistic about our future. So if you'll allow me for a moment, let me take a second to just say to all my Booz Allen colleagues, thank you. Thank you for your hard work and for all that you do. Your passion and your commitment are truly all inspiring. And to everyone on the call, thanks once again for joining us. Have a great day, and enjoy the rest of the summer.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Horacio Rozanski",
            "content": "Thank you, Nathan, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. This morning, Matt and I are excited to share outstanding financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our business is performing extremely well across all metrics. In the first quarter, revenue grew 18% year-over-year, with industry-leading organic growth. The bottom line was exceptional, and our headcount grew at a record pace to more than 32,000 Booz Allen employees. I believe these numbers speak for themselves. I could not be more proud of our people for delivering a truly tremendous first quarter, as we advance our VoLT strategy and serve our clients' most critical missions. This morning, I will put the results in context of our investment thesis and current year outlook. Then I'll discuss how our people and culture are foundational to our sustained performance. And later, Matt will cover the first quarter results and expectations for the full fiscal year in depth. Before I go on, as you know, on July 21, we announced settlement of the U.S. Department of Justice Civil investigation into highly technical elements of our government cost accounting and indirect cost charging practices. The settlement is within the expected range we previously disclosed in our fourth quarter earnings in May and has been factored into our updated cash guidance. We believe the company acted lawfully and responsibly. The settlement provides certainty to our employees, clients and shareholders and allows us to return to regular order with the important work of our DCMA and DCAA regulators. And yesterday, the SEC informed us that they had concluded their investigation into Booz Allen. Returning to this quarter's performance. As always, - it is important to view our latest results in the context of long-term objectives. Our multiyear investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA and to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion by fiscal year 2025. We have said we expect to achieve that goal through a combination of above-market organic revenue growth, strong and stable margins with capacity to invest in our people and capabilities and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. Our first quarter results demonstrate we are on track to achieve our adjusted EBITDA target. We have excellent momentum and remain above expectations on organic growth and profit. While strategic acquisitions continue to be a priority, our pipeline of opportunities is more limited than we expected. On balance, this probably means that we will reach our multiyear targets through greater organic contribution while simultaneously retaining increased flexibility to deploy capital in response to market conditions. Shifting to our current fiscal year's expectations. On our May earnings call, we described the growth pattern for the year as a strong first half with less certainty in the second half. At that time, the debt ceiling and federal budget negotiations were ongoing. As a result, we outlined guidance that reflected our momentum and the range of federal funding scenarios after September 30. We also said we expected to start the year at or above the top end of our revenue guidance. One quarter end, our performance is ahead of the expectations we set in May. Demand for our services and solutions, combined with record headcount growth continue to fuel our momentum. While we're pleased that Congress raised a debt ceiling in June, significant uncertainty still remains about the budget for the government's next fiscal year. For us, the key to achieving and exceeding our expectations is our success in selling and starting work before September 30. That was our premise going into the year. It remains our top priority, given the potential for protracted federal budget negotiations. Transitioning to a longer-term view. Over the last three earnings calls, I discussed the three key dimensions of our VoLT strategy, velocity, leadership and technology. Booz Allen's extraordinary team of leaders and colleagues have achieved significant progress in all three dimensions. And perhaps one of the best indicators of our progress is the headcount growth we have experienced in the last four quarters. Therefore, today, I would like to spend a few moments sharing some insights into our people and culture. First of all, credit for our hiring momentum goes to our leaders and team. While it is true that the hiring market is less frantic than a year ago, our record hiring goes well beyond that. Over the past year, our business and recruiting leaders work together to transform our talent acquisition processes. We have streamlined the hiring life cycle and made meaningful improvements to the experience of becoming a new Booz Allen employee. Together, these outcomes set us up well to efficiently hire at speed and scale. Second, I firmly believe we have an industry-leading employee value proposition. We care for our people, and we invest in our people. That means we continuously seek to understand what our employees need to thrive in their lives and careers. And then we align our actions, policies and benefits accordingly. This level of responsiveness was evident in the bold actions we took to protect the health and safety of all our people throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. And today, we continue to respond to the evolving personal and professional needs of our talent. Here are some examples. From a well-being perspective, we have expanded our mental health resources, created new wellness incentives and offer greater access to services and treatments at a time of nationwide shortages. We also know learning and professional development are important to our employees, particularly as technological change accelerates. Through our technically focused employee groups, boot camps and upskilling programs, we empower our highly technical workforce to stay on the leading edge. For example, our AI training programs offer a progressive learning journey from basic AI literacy through expert proficiency. This provides all of our employees with the opportunity to hone their skills and thrive as they serve our clients' pressing needs. We have also taken the best of what we've learned in recent years to provide new ways of working that offer more flexibility. And we are investing in leadership development to foster a culture that optimizes performance and strengthens belonging as we grow in a hybrid work environment. Ultimately, people thriving in our culture are at the heart of our sustained growth quarter after quarter. Across the firm, our diverse talent unite around our purpose and live our values, as they contribute to something bigger than themselves. We have veterans, clinicians and technologists working together to help improve access to benefits across the VA. Scientists and digital architects, collaborating and innovating to make climate resilience a reality. Intel and cyber experts working around the clock to secure our homeland, cross-functional teams of data scientists, ethicists, mission experts and physicists using emerging technologies like generative AI and quantum as a force for good. And employees giving back by bringing STEM indication to youth in underserved communities. In sum, we work hard every day to make Booz Allen a place of empowerment, opportunity, accountability and belonging, a place where each person can reach her or his full potential and change the world. Our amazing people, empowered by our unique culture are the reason our strategy works, our results are repeatable and we create sustainable shareholder value. And this is why on these quarterly earnings calls, Matt and I are so proud, so proud to represent the incredible work of the over 32,000 Booz Allen employees. And with that, Matt, over to you. Good morning, Sheila. Thanks for the question, Sheila. I mean the specific answer to your question is we remain very close to our clients. We connect with them all the time. We've been very transparent throughout about all of these and our clients understand it and have put it into context. So I don't believe, and I think the numbers would bear out that this has affected our ability to win business or to execute our business, and we're now able to look ahead. I mean, I think to put the whole thing in context, we just had a record quarter. We're extremely pleased with that.

We're excited and optimistic. And we love this virtuous circle that we can create when amazing people do great work, clients ask for more. So we grow that allows us to invest in attracting more amazing people and then building new capabilities and the like. So that's - hopefully, that answers your question. Sure. I'll start. What's powered the Civil growth now for several years is the emphasis on digital transformation across multiple civil agencies, a lot of emphasis on the health agencies, not just the VA but also CDC, NIH, CMS and the like. And so - that continues to be a big growth engine. We're seeing really at this point, growth across our entire civil portfolio really driven, first of it was cloud and digital transformation. We're now seeing more demand for cyber for AI. And all of that comes together because we bring both the mission and the technology aspects together in ways that our clients value and we believe nobody else can. Good morning. I think the short form of the answer is all of the above. This is a topic that, as you know, we've been investing in and thinking about for years. At the beginning, there was sort of, I'll call it more curiosity than interest, then you turn to interest, then it turn into demand. Our AI team is growing extraordinarily fast. And it's - this is permeating really the entirety of our business, I can't say this with absolute precision, but essentially, all of our largest contracts have some form of AI in scope or the possibility for AI in scope, I don't think our visionary clients who write a 5 or a 10-year contract now that does not include these capabilities because we all know they're transformational. And Booz Allen, I'm proud to say, is at the forefront. Thank you. I appreciate that question. And this has been an actual -- a fair amount of discussion internally because it's important to us.

And I think it's going to be really the next wave of our value proposition to really help our people understand this is where I want my career to go, what kinds of opportunities are out there that get me there? What kind of training do I need to have to connect into those opportunities and be qualified to do it that there's a ton of upside there. And then beyond that, as you can imagine, every aspect of our business, we need to think through. And again, we're prioritizing high leverage areas first. It's the answer I guess would be yes on both sides of it. Our portfolio, as you've known us for a long time, it used to be so many small contracts and very few large ones. And now the portfolio has still a lot of small contracts and a lot of small task orders into the thousands and a significant share of really large programs. On the large program side, we - those when they get recompeted, each - any one of those can move the needle some. What we're seeing there is that recompetes come in generally a larger scope and even larger ceiling than the original programs. So that's obviously a source of upside, and it's a source of increased competition because they attract more attention. And our pipeline is rich. We have a good number of recompetes over the next 12 to 18 months. We have a very good number of things were going at that are either new or potential takeaways. And all in all, we're optimistic about where we are and how we're positioned. In addition to what we're seeing from a book-to-bill perspective, we're seeing significant demand from inside existing contracts, particularly in our Civil business. So that's a dynamic that as we produce a tremendous value for clients, we're seeing additional tasking on existing contracts at a pace, quite frankly, we haven't seen in the past. There's large contracts being competed all the time. We have a couple of large contracts in health that are up for competition. We have a couple of large contracts in our Defense business they are up for recompete. And obviously, we're tracking those very closely. We're well positioned if we lost any of those. Obviously, that would not be good. But at the same time, where we have a number of very large, very exciting contracts that were awaiting word on and so forth. So -- on balance, as we think about the business, we think about contract vehicles, obviously, they're important, but we think about them as a means to an end and the end is to really serve the mission. And to create overlap between these contracts when we can so that we are actually well positioned to continue to serve a mission if we lose part of the scope because of a contract going away, if we win something our commitment is to the mission and to continue to grow into the missions that matter. Thank you. Yes, Cai, just to be very specific, we have not over hired. Our team is fully utilized, and we are leaning forward. Thank you very much, and thank you all for your questions and for taking the time to join us this morning. As we close today, I'd like to once again recognize this incredible Booz Allen team. They are the reason that I feel so optimistic about our future. So if you'll allow me for a moment, let me take a second to just say to all my Booz Allen colleagues, thank you. Thank you for your hard work and for all that you do. Your passion and your commitment are truly all inspiring. And to everyone on the call, thanks once again for joining us. Have a great day, and enjoy the rest of the summer."

            "name": "Matt Calderone",
            "content": "Thank you, Horacio, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. As Horacio noted, we are extremely pleased with our start to the fiscal year. Given the momentum in our business, we anticipated that we would come out of the gate strong. On our last call, I indicated that our first quarter growth would be at or above the top end of our guided range. As these numbers demonstrate, our team exceeded these expectations. Thus, while it is early in the year and significant funding uncertainty remains, we are very well positioned against our fiscal 2024 guidance, and we remain on track to deliver on our multiyear investment thesis objectives. Now, please turn to Slide 6 as I cover our first quarter results in detail. Total revenue for the quarter grew 18% year-over-year to approximately $2.7 billion. Organic revenue was up 16.7% year-over-year, including double-digit growth across all of our federal markets. Revenue excluding billable expenses grew 16.9% to approximately $1.8 billion. This is our strongest growth quarter since we went public in 2010. Our VoLT strategy has positioned us well in areas that are primed for long-term growth. Our Defense business continued to accelerate in the first quarter, with revenue increasing approximately 19% year-over-year. In Defense, we remain focused on bringing differentiated scaled solutions to the war fighting mission. In Civil, revenue was up approximately 20% year-over-year. We continue to position ourselves as a critical partner in the federal digital transformation. Our Intelligence business grew by approximately 18% year-over-year, including several exciting new wins and a healthy pipeline of opportunities. We continue to expect the pace of revenue growth in Intel to slow over the balance of the fiscal year due to challenging year-over-year comps and the roll-off of a large classified contract. Finally, our global commercial business, which accounted for 2% of revenue in the quarter, declined approximately 23% year-over-year. This reflects the sale of MENA and Managed Threat services businesses in the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2023. Turning now to headcount. As of June 30, Booz Allen had more than 32,000 people working directly and indirectly in support of our clients' missions. We had a record-setting 12.5% annual increase in client staff. This is the result of continued hiring to meet demand, a more efficient talent acquisition process and enhanced value proposition. Total headcount inclusive of corporate staff, increased 11.2%. Attrition remains well below historical levels. While we very much remain in a growth posture, we do anticipate headcount growth to moderate in comparison to the brisk pace we set last fiscal year. Pivoting to demand, we still see a strong pace in volume of award activity. Net bookings for the first quarter were approximately $2.7 billion. This translates to a quarterly book-to-bill of 1.03 times, an improvement from 0.72 times in the prior year quarter. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill as of June 30 was 1.24 times, in line with our current growth expectations. Total backlog was up approximately 9.3% year-over-year to $31.3 billion. Funded backlog grew 22% to $4.9 billion, unfunded backlog fell 9.5% to $9 billion and priced options grew 18.6% to $17.3 billion. Looking forward, our qualified pipeline of $41.9 billion is up approximately 12% compared to this time last year. With this pipeline and backlog, we believe we can continue to convert strong demand into industry-leading organic growth. Moving now to the bottom line. We earned $307 million in adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, up 21.5% from the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin of 11.6% was approximately 40 basis points higher than the same period a year ago. This was a function of our overall growth, strong contract-level performance and efforts to operate the business more efficiently. First quarter net income increased 16.9% year-over-year to $161 million. Adjusted net income grew 28% year-over-year to $193 million. This excluded the incremental legal reserve of approximately $28 million recorded in the first quarter in connection with the now settled DOJ matter. Diluted earnings per share grew 18.4% year-over-year to $1.22. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the incremental reserve, grew 30.1% year-over-year to $1.47. Moving now to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with $210 million of cash on hand. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $82 million, the result of $71.5 million of cash used for operating activities and $10.5 million of CapEx. This was in line with our expectations as the first quarter is typically our low point in cash flow for the year. Operating cash was seasonally light due to the timing of bonus payouts but was aided by strong collections in overall revenue growth. We continue to spend on strategic investments and use working capital to support our outsized growth. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $2.7 billion, and our net leverage ratio was approximately 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample capacity to generate strong future cash flow and to deploy capital to drive additional shareholder value. Turning to Slide 8. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $175 million of capital to shareholders. This included $63 million in quarterly cash dividends and approximately $112 million in share repurchases at an average price of $96.04 [ph] per share. On capital deployment, we are staying patient and disciplined as we navigate macroeconomic conditions, budget uncertainty and a challenging M&A environment. Strategic acquisitions remain a key part of our investment thesis, and we continue to focus on finding small- to medium-sized tuck-in acquisitions that are aligned with our VoLT strategy, act as accelerants to growth, create new pathways for client value and meet our financial parameters. Finally, today, I am pleased to announce that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.47 per share that will be payable on August 31 to stockholders of record as of August 15. Turning now to our full year fiscal outlook. Please go to Slide 9. Last quarter, we set annual guidance ranges that anticipated an aggressive first half, followed by a more conservative second half. We noted this was due to macroeconomic and budget uncertainty, the pattern of prior year comparable performance and a typical first half second half pattern in our business. These dynamics have not changed and it is still early in our fiscal year. Today, I will give you a little more color on the three factors I indicated will determine where we fall within our guidance range. First, the budget environment. While the recent debt ceiling agreement took certain worst-case scenarios off the table, the timing and nature of fiscal 2024 federal appropriations are still unclear. Second, our conversion of demand. The second quarter is typically our strongest in terms of bookings. As Horacio noted, it is especially crucial this year. Leading up to the government's fiscal year-end, there is a big ramp in tactical selling, bids and proposals. Our entire team is focused on staying ahead of pace so that we add to our backlog and efficiently start work on new or extended contracts across our portfolio. The third factor is the timing and pace of headcount growth. The net hedge we added in the first quarter give us confidence we will meet our target of adding 3% to 5% client staff this fiscal year. In addition, we are still assessing certain aspects of the financial impact of the settlement with the Department of Justice, apart from the impact on our operating cash flow, which I will walk you through shortly. We expect to see a modest increase to our full fiscal year interest expense and a modest decrease in our provision for income tax expense and adjusted EBITDA. Given our exceptional first quarter performance, we are confident about our outlook. Other than cash, we are not updating guidance at this time. As a reminder, our full year fiscal guidance is as follows, at the top line, we expect revenue growth of 7% to 11%, 6% to 10%, of which will be organic. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins in the high 10% to 11% range. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA dollar range of between $1.075 billion and $1.105 billion or approximately 6% to 9% growth year-over-year. Our ADEPS guidance range is between $4.80 and $4.95 per share. For our updated cash guidance, we now expect operating cash flow of between $160 million and $260 million. This reflects an estimated net impact of $340 million related to our settlement with the Department of Justice, inclusive of expected tax and interest impacts. In closing, I am extremely proud of our first quarter results and confident that we can build on the success. We have the right strategy, and more importantly, we have the right people. Our stellar first quarter results are a direct product of their hard work and dedication. With that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Good morning. I was going to answer the cash portion of your question, Sheila. As Horacio said, we are very much looking forward to getting back to normal course with our DCMA and DCA colleagues. And over time, I do believe that we'll have a benefit to our cash performance. As you others have noted, there is a meaningful unbilled sitting on our balance sheet right now, and we look forward to working with our regulators to work through outstanding audits and get back to normal course. Yes, I'll pick two of the three. It certainly Q2 sales is critical. It's - as we said in the script, it's important every year, particularly this year, given the second item I'll highlight, which is the funding uncertainty. And really, our Q2 sets us up not just for this fiscal year but for next fiscal year as well. And that's what we're trying to do, not just on the bookings side, but obviously, with headcount as well as produce the year-over-year organic growth that we desire and our investors expect. Yes, Matt, I'll start and Horacio may add to it. Certainly, it's a significant payment. So of course, it has an impact. But that said, we're still very much committed to using the balance sheet to drive incremental strategic and financial value. We have the balance sheet strength to do that and organic performance on the EBITDA side certainly fortifies that. Strategic acquisitions remain our priority. But as we've said, that [ph] market remains challenging. We're leaning into it. We've got a good pipeline that we're prosecuting, but deals are harder to consummate. I'm sure you've heard, not just from us, but from others that a lot of deals are dying at the finish line, but we're going to continue to lead into it. That said, we have the flexibility to deploy capital in other ways, it's appropriate to create shareholder value. And I think you saw that last quarter, we bought back a lot of shares. Cai, I'll take that one. Look, we had an exceptional Q1. We knew it was going to be strong. And as both Horacio and I said, it exceeded expectations, and it positions us very, very well within our guided range. And we are seeing, as Horacio said, significant momentum in the business across all three sectors on both the supply and demand side. It is early. We do want to see how Q2 plays out. There is, as you know, significant uncertainty in the funding environment that remains. And as I'm sure you know, our comps do get harder. We've generated 2% to 3% headcount growth each quarter for the last quarter, four quarters, which is really unprecedented. We're not going to replicate that. Utilization spiked in Q2, Q3, we added ever watch. There are a handful of reasons why I think the year-over-year comps get more challenging. But none of this should take away from the underlying momentum that we see. We're just going to see the pace of growth moderate some over the back half. Cai, we're always looking at opportunities to revise our capital structure."
