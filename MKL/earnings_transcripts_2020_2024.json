Please go ahead.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you and good morning to everyone and thank you is the key and operative word to start off this message. The 18,000 employees of Markel turned in a wonderful performance in every dimension in 2020 and I just want to start off the call on behalf of Richie and Jeremy and everybody thanking the associates of Markel for their work throughout 2020, it was not an easy year. Markel is a holding company and I think the thing that we hold most dear are our ideas and our values of taking care of our customers and our associates. We think that creates a win, win, win architecture where our associates win by being part of Markel, our customers win by doing business with us, and our shareholders win just when we do this first two things, we produce good returns on capital and we think that is the ultimate form of sustainability.  All three engines of Markel fired in 2020 and provided positive thrust but it might not have seemed that way at various points of the year especially early on, in the early days of the pandemic. The great philosopher Mike Tyson said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Well, we got punched in the mouth in the early days of the pandemic, but our plan is to build Markel in such a way that we can take a hit, we can get in the ring with Mike Tyson, we can take the punch in the mouth and keep on fighting. That's 2020 in a nutshell, Markel is a resilience machine, our three engines withstood the blows from the early days of 2020, and our 18,000 plus associates adapted and figured out how to recalibrate and accomplish our mission of taking care of our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. I am pleased this morning now to spend a little time with you reviewing the results and with that I am going to turn it over first to Jeremy Noble, our CFO to discuss the numbers. Richie will then talk about our insurance operations. I'll hop back on to talk about investments and ventures and then we'll open it up for your questions. With that Jeremy, thank you. \nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Following year that reflected significant volatility and widespread impacts attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of the results we delivered across all three of our engines in 2020, which demonstrate the strength and resilience of our businesses. Our underwriting operations delivered an underwriting profit despite elevated levels of catastrophic events and significant losses attributable to the global pandemic as we benefited from achieving meaningful rate increases and growth in new business. Our Markel Ventures operations saw strong top and bottom line performance amid challenging economic conditions and we achieved solid investment returns despite volatile market conditions and historically low interest rates.  Looking at our operating results, gross written premiums were $7.2 billion for the year, compared to $6.4 billion in 2019, an increase of 11%. This increase was attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $6 billion, an increase of 13% compared to a year ago. This premium growth is attributable to both new business and improved pricing within our professional liability and general liability product lines, as well as our personal lines and marine and energy product lines. Gross written premiums with our reinsurance segment were consistent with 2019 at roughly $1.1 billion. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2020, which is down one point from 84% a year ago. Earned premiums increased 11% to $5.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2020 was a 98 compared to a 94 last year. For the fourth quarter 2020, we reported an 89 combined ratio compared to a 93 a year ago. Our full year 2020 combined ratio included 360 million or six points of underwriting losses attributed to the COVID-19 and 169 million or three points attributed to natural catastrophes. This compares to $100 million or two points of catastrophe losses in 2019. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 and natural catastrophes, our combined ratio for 2020 improved due to a three-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and one-point reduction in our expense ratio arising from improved performance within our insurance segment in 2020 compared to 2019. With regards to prior year loss reserve development consistent with our reserve philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $606 million in 2020, compared to $535 million in 2019.  Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included a net income or $618 million in 2020, compared to $1.6 billion in 2019, and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of equity securities, which experienced significant market volatility during the year. The impact of significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio in the first quarter, driven by unfavorable market value movements resulting from the onset of the pandemic, were more than offset by increases in the fair value of our equity portfolio over the last three quarters of 2020. As I mentioned in previous calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected and we may continue to see volatility in the equity markets due in part to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. With regards to net investment income we reported $372 million in 2020 compared to $452 million last year. The decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates, as well as lower holdings and lower yields on fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $353 million net of taxes during 2020, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from declines in interest rates.  Now, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $2.8 billion for 2020, compared to $2.1 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April, and VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the contributions of Lansing and VSC operating revenues within our Markel Venture's operations decreased compared to 2019 as a result of lower sales volumes attributed to the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $367 million for 2020, compared to $264 million a year ago, reflecting the contributions of Lansing and VSC, as well as growth and improved operating results at certain of our businesses. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate for 2020 was 17%, compared to 21% in 2019. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 was primarily attributable to a tax benefit that was recognized in 2020 for cumulative losses on certain investments we sold. We reported net income to common shareholders of $798 million for 2020 compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.8 billion a year ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders for 2020 was $1.2 billion, compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for 2020, compared to $1.3 billion for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters, as well as greater cash flows for Markel Ventures given increased earnings. And that's an asset to the holding company of $4.1 billion at the end of December compared to $4 billion at the end of 2019. The increase in the holding company invested assets was due in part to the proceeds from our May preferred shares offering offset by funds used to acquire Lansing earlier in the year.  Total shareholder\u2019s equity stood at $12.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.1 billion at the end of 2019. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to be opportunistic around deploying capital, including to support growth in our insurance operations, given the attractive opportunities we are seeing in the specialty insurance marketplace. With that I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thank you, Jeremy and good morning, everyone. As Tom and Jeremy have said, we finished 2020 strong, posting an overall underwriting profit with a 98% combined ratio for the year. While this is not the result we were aiming for as we entered 2020 after recording 360 million of underwriting losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by natural catastrophe events in the third and fourth quarter adding an additional 169 million in underwriting losses, this is an amazing accomplishment.  We finished the year with a fourth quarter in which we recorded a combined ratio of 85% before the effects of COVID and natural catastrophe losses. We achieved strong growth and meaningful rate increases across most of our insurance and reinsurance product lines and saw reductions in our attritional loss ratios across most of our products in the last half of 2020 as the impact of price increases and portfolio management efforts started to materialize. We continue to seek out opportunities to grow and benefit from the positive insurance and reinsurance market environment and to reduce volatility in our underwriting results as we enter 2021.  So now I'll discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations, and insurance linked securities operations. So starting with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for 2020 were up 709 million or 13% and net earned premiums were up 544 million, also 13%. Gross written premiums were up 15% in the fourth quarter. Premium growth for both the quarter and year was driven by continued strong organic and new business growth, along with the impact of rate increases across several product lines, most notably in our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy, and personal line products. Importantly, virtually all of our growth was in our preferred product offerings, as our top line growth was impacted in part by targeted reductions on products and accounts that weren't meeting our profitability goals. We believe our efforts around portfolio construction will continue to improve profitability levels over time.  The combined ratio for the insurance segment in 2020 was 96 versus 93 last year. The three-point increase was driven by losses recognized in 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with several mid-sized cat events that impacted the current year combined ratio by six and three points respectively. The impact from COVID and cat events were partially offset by a three-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio arising from several product lines, most notably in our property, professional liability, and marine and energy product lines due to reduced loss experienced, rate increases, and changes in business days. We also benefited in the current year from a lower expense ratio, driven primarily by the continued growth in net earned premiums as we've sought to keep controllable expenses flat.  Turning to the reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for 2020 were up 17 million or 2% and earned premiums were up 26 million or 3%. Premium growth for the year was driven by growth in our general liability and professional liability lines, partially offset by lower premiums in our credit and surety line. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 104 in both 2020 and 2019. The 2020 combined ratio was impacted by seven points of underwriting losses from COVID-19 and five points from natural catastrophe events versus a ten-point impact from nat cat events in 2019. Excluding the losses from COVID and cat events, the combined ratio decreased due to a lower attritional loss ratio across several product lines, partially offset by less favorable development on prior year losses.  2020 represented the fourth consecutive year of underwriting losses in our reinsurance segment, primarily as a result of unprecedented and significant catastrophe activity over the last four years, along with the impact from COVID-19 in 2020. While there are certainly opportunities in the current market to grow our top line in reinsurance, we're going to be very cautious about growth in the near-term until we are convinced profitability issues have been resolved by a combination of price increases and portfolio management. To illustrate the difference in our strategies in insurance versus reinsurance, over the past three years our insurance gross written premiums have grown at a 13% compound average growth rate versus essentially no growth in reinsurance. Recent results have not been good enough in our reinsurance portfolio, and we've not earned our targeted return on capital. We recognize that reinsurance is a volatile business and volatility is what we are paid to assume is a reinsurer. We will continue to make adjustments to our core casualty and specialty products, and believe we're on track to produce appropriate returns on a smaller, more focused reinsurance portfolio.  So next, I'll go to program services. Gross written premium volume for our state and national program services operations were down 10% to 2.1 billion for the year, driven by the cessation of two large programs earlier in 2020. This was partially offset by new program business added in 2020. As a reminder, almost all of these gross written premiums are ceded to third parties. Program services business continues to perform extremely well, producing consistently strong operating margins. We're also encouraged by new business development opportunities and it is clear that there is rising demand for fronting services to help match insurance risk to capital.  Moving to our ILS operations, our combined ILS operations have a little under 11 billion in net assets under management at December 31, 2020. Revenues from our ILS operations decreased 6% for the year, due primarily to the continued orderly wind down CATCo, which continues to return investor capital as quickly as possible. Before considering amortization expense, the operating loss from our ILS operations in 2020 was wholly attributable to cost to CATCo, the majority of which are non-recurring in nature. For 2021, Nephila has received in excess of 1 billion of new subscriptions to date. This is driven by proven market conditions and in part by opportunities created with the transfer of our Markel Global Property Cat portfolio to Nephila. A portion of this capital was deployed at 1-1 and additional amounts will be deployed at major renewal dates over the course of the year.  Nephila was also able to establish and are working on a new investment vehicle. These include an ESG Impact Fund and Lloyd Syndicate Multiclass Fund. That being said, Nephila was impacted by the elevated level of U.S. nat cat activity in the third and fourth quarters, which impacted their fund performance for the year. When allowing for cat losses, development classes or side pockets, anticipated redemption activity, and the timing of capital allocation from new subscriptions, the total increase to AUM will be tempered to start the year. Going forward, we feel strongly about the prospects for our ILS operations.  I'll finish up with a bit of market commentary and I'm sure there'll be questions afterwards. Trends that we've discussed in past quarters continued in the fourth quarter and after January 1 renewals. We see continuing price momentum in almost all lines. Our insurance rate increases continue to average in low double-digits and move double-digits overall for the 2020 year. Reinsurance, which has lagged primary insurance pricing closed the gap throughout the year, but we're still not as strong as rates being achieved in the primary market. This situation helps further explain our continued double-digit growth in insurance versus roughly flat in reinsurance. While new entrants and incremental capital raises have had an impact around the edges of the market, we believe that pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, elevated cat activity, social inflation, COVID-19 losses, and economic uncertainty are likely to persist throughout 2021.  This hardening market has nothing to do with a shortage of capital. Unlike previous hard markets, capital was actually plentiful. The factors I just mentioned are driving the market and all capital both new and old must face that reality as they price business. We also believe our business will continue to benefit as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. While large and mid-sized business has shown reasonable resiliency to the economic disruptions, small business, which is a meaningful part of our portfolio, have been adversely impacted. As the vaccine rollouts gained traction, we expect small business activity to rebound, getting pent up demands in the economy. We enter 2021 well-positioned and excited about our opportunities. We're laser focused on our goal to deliver a 90% combined ratio or lower for the year with double-digit top line growth and we're off to a fast start in January and here in early February. Thanks for your time today. And now I'd like to turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Richard, I appreciate it. My comments will be extraordinarily brief this morning. Jeremy has given you the numbers, so I look forward to your questions. In the Ventures area, as Jeremy reported, record year, $2.8 billion of revenues, $367 million of EBITDA, and certainly seven points in the year earlier on the only two words that I can use to describe the performance by the Markel Ventures Group of Companies are amazed and grateful. They have just done a spectacular job of figuring out how to operate in the world in which we live and they've produced record results. And as Jeremy alluded to, that's a record level of profitability even without the acquisitions of Lansing and VSC.  On the investment side, we first and foremost protected our balance sheet and we produced positive returns at the same time following our consistent, historical, disciplined, and sustainable approach. And net all of this, of what's happening in the insurance related businesses, the venture businesses and the investment operations, is that all of those factors combined to put us in a very strong capital position which will enable us to play both offense and defense as we enter into 2021 and I suspect we'll have the opportunity to have both teams on the field at various points during the year. So we're very optimistic, we're very grateful for the results that the 18,000 plus employees of Markel produced over the years. I just wanted to thank everybody for the efforts in an extraordinary year that we did not have a playbook for as we entered into it. But we're pleased to report these results to you and we now look forward to taking your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Then to the first question is from Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Stefano: Yeah, thanks and good morning. I was hoping you could talk about the decision to release -- understandably it is a small portion, but release a small portion of the COVID reserves and maybe you can help frame for us what you see as the risk around COVID estimates and I guess I'm just surprised that we're seeing reserves come down already, it feels like industry commentary pretty broadly is that the liability lines will have impact over the next couple of years and of course, the industry always has this mantra of being quick to recognize the bad news and slow to recognize the good news?\nJeremy Noble: Hey, Phil it is Jeremy. I'll start and Rich, you might join in. It was pretty modest reduction and actually we didn't change our gross COVID loss reserve estimates. That is actually a reflection of a little bit of additional benefit from reinsurance. And part of that is associated with our kind of enterprise aggregate covers that we would have in place. It would have been influenced by the fact that we had elevated levels of nat cat losses. So really the only thing we reflected was a pretty modest amount of additional reinsurance recoveries. We didn't change the gross reserves. Rich, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on it. \nRichie Whitt: Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it really was all about the aggregate cover and some of that benefit from the aggregate cover getting allocated to COVID. So gross reserves were unchanged. Totally agree with you in terms of the uncertainty around COVID reserves. I think in terms of the two areas where we have exposure, debt cancellation, I think -- at this point I think we have a pretty good handle on the debt cancellation. And I don't expect a whole lot of volatility around that. The business interruption in the UK, again, now that we've got the Supreme Court decision, I think most of the areas are laid out and it's a matter of moving to final settlement with the insurers. And I think we feel reasonably comfortable about those reserves. But again, this is first time any of us is seeing this situation. And then in the U.S., I know there's been a couple of verdicts that have probably been adverse, you would say, adverse to the insurance industry. But the reality is the 50, 60 or so verdicts that are out there have been positive for the insurance industry in terms of what constitutes physical damage and upholding of virus exclusions, communicable disease exclusions. So, there's still volatility and potential risk out there. But, we know we're nine months later into it, 10 months later into it, we know more about it today than we did when it all started. And I think we feel as good as we can about the reserves.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay, that's an interesting point of clarification on the gross versus the net. And looking at the reinsurance segment, I guess two questions within that. The first, was there any benefit from a profit accrual in the fourth quarter that helped the results? And Richie you had framed thinking about the top line growth in reinsurance in your opening remarks. And it feels like as we got the cat exposed business that comes out and goes through Nephila instead, I mean, it feels like this is going to be a clear headwind, cat exposed business aside is flattish kind of the right way to think about growth for reinsurance in the short run?\nRichie Whitt: Yeah, I think flattish is the right way to think about growth in the short run for reinsurance. Obviously, we've transferred roughly 200 million of catastrophe business over to Nephila. So, all things being equal, you would expect gross written premium to be down a bit this year in terms of our casualty, professional, and specialty portfolios. The one thing that is happening, that could change that a bit is just price increases. We could put the same lines down on treaties but end up with more premium because of the price increases. So I don't expect significant growth, obviously we've got over -- we would have to overcome the 200 million that's coming out. We may not be down the full 200 million. We could be something short of that, just simply because of price increases on treaties. The first part of your question about a profit, I don't -- I'm not real sure what you're talking about there, I'm sorry, Phil.\nPhilip Stefano: Yeah. Was there a profit accrual that flowed through the expense ratio or accrued to the benefit of the reinsurance segment in some way, I guess when I was teasing out the quarterly numbers, it's not like there was a slight uptick from what I would have expected?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah, hey Phil. The expense ratio, you're right. In the quarter, the expense ratio in reinsurance was up. It is sort of personnel related expenses. Part of that is the costs associated with our decision to exit out of property within the Markel Global RE division. So, much more personnel costs from that than anything on the kind of the profit side.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay, and just one point of clarification, I think that was -- the 90% combined ratio target, was that for all of P&C or just insurance? \nJeremy Noble: That's for all of P&C. \nPhilip Stefano: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJeff Schmitt: Hi, good morning. Looking at the growth in the insurance segment, obviously really great rate increases, you had said are sort of averaging in the double-digits. But I was wondering how much of a drag you may be seeing there from low exposures, audit premiums, tightening terms and conditions if you're lowering limits or increasing deductibles. Are those factors -- I mean, is that a couple of point drag for the year or is that maybe not as high?\nThomas Gayner: Yeah, there's no doubt that we talked about small businesses being impacted, obviously a little bit harder by the pandemic. So some of that business was not there to renew and maybe the new business stream is not as strong as a result of that. We are definitely in places shortening our limits as a way to manage the portfolio. And so, you're getting a rate increase, but you might actually have less premium because of the shortening of the limits. We measure the pure rate increase and so it doesn't include things like changing terms and conditions or shortening up limits. So there is some drag there but I can't quantify that for you. The reality is, I mean, we're up over double-digits in terms of our rate increases and we're up 13% in growth for the year. So there's a little bit more growth than there is rate increase. So that suggests to me that net, net, net, there is some new business on top of just the rate increases that we're receiving. But there's no doubt there is some drag there. And then in addition, we're always remixing the portfolio and there was over 100 million of business that we exited during 2020 because it wasn't performing to our return hurdles. So, our growth was net of having to get out of some of that business.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay, and just on that repositioning, which -- what areas did you get out of, what areas are you looking to kind of shift to?\nThomas Gayner: Sure. We got out of a couple of programs that were underperforming, one in particular, that was probably 70 million or 80 million. We came off of that program during the year. Some of our smaller program business Camps, as an example, social services, very little opportunity for growth, challenged areas in terms of profitability we have gotten out of. And where we are really focused is professional liability, casualty, property, marine and energy where we're growing nicely and our rate increases are not just double-digits, they're mid to high, 15 to 20 sorts of increases.\nJeremy Noble: One other line would be the personal accident contingency in the international space\u2026 \nThomas Gayner: Got out of that as well. Yes.\nJeff Schmitt: Got it. Okay, and then just one on the expense ratio in the insurance segment, running at 36%, it's been high 30s over the past few years. I know you even mentioned just earned premium volume being up, but earned premium volume growth did pretty good for a number of years, I guess. Is 36 the right run rate to think about there?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah, we're really continuing to work on the expense ratio. It is a great point that we've seen that come down. Our variable component of the ratio really is pretty unchanged. So most of the benefit you see, year-over-year is us holding the direct and controllable expenses probably flat while sort of in insurance, growing net earned premium 13%. We think that's a trend that we can continue to see as we grow. So we've been really focused on trying to hold it and control the expenses flat and scaling off our operations that are sort of in place. So we've seen that really measured over a period of time. I mean, you can you can go back for a number of years and really see the movement in the expense ratio. So we're going to continue to work on that and I think we can do a bit better than even where it was for 2020.\nJeff Schmitt: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Fox of Fenimore. Please go ahead. \nJohn Fox: Yeah, hi, thank you. I have a number of questions. First of all, very good results, thank you. Richie you mentioned bank cancellation. I've been doing some reading, of course, the Summer Olympics were, I guess, technically postponed and there's some thought that if they're canceled this year, that would be a big insurance industry loss. So could you comment on that point of view and what exposure Markel might have?\nRichie Whitt: We did have a portion of the exposure to the Olympics. We wrote a portion of that. If the Olympics were ultimately canceled, we don't believe it would have much impact to our reserves. We sort of took the position that it very well could be canceled in terms of setting up our reserves. So we wouldn't expect much change to our reserves if, in fact, they ended up having to cancel.\nJohn Fox: Okay, great. And in your comments, you talked about the reinsurance business, \u201cwanting an acceptable return\u201d. What is that for reinsurance and what type of capital base is that with about 900 million of premium?\nRichie Whitt: You know, I think capital I'd say it's about, one to one in terms of the capital and we need the same 90. We need the same 90 combined on the reinsurance. I mean, actually, I'd like to see it be a little bit lower. I said 90 or better in 2021 and -- now, let me just say, we're coming off some tough performance the last few years. I don't know that our report, put the reserves up at a 90 initially. We will have a margin of safety. But I want to be damn sure it's ultimately going to prove out to a 90 and so that's the goal.\nJeremy Noble: And John, it is Jeremy. It should be a little bit more capital efficient too, I mean that was part of the decision to sort of exit property and sort of focus on doing property sort of through, you know, Nephila\u2019s offering. Obviously nat cat on the property reinsurance side is a much more capital intensive product line.\nJohn Fox: Right, sure. It makes sense. And Richard, did you give an outlook for program services and you mentioned a couple of accounts that didn't renew, but then the fourth quarter was strong, deep. Do you expect that to grow this year?\nRichie Whitt: Yeah, I did, I do. One of those accounts was one that they received, they were upgraded back to A from A minus and so we knew all along eventually that program would go away. We actually were fortunate to keep it longer than we thought. So that was always going to be one that was going to take a little while to replace. The new business pipeline is full right now. We really have seen a pickup in activity, so I think we'll grow in 2021.\nJohn Fox: Okay, great. And then just kind of a simple question, but clarification on ILS investment management. So you have 212 of revenue and 231 of expenses for a loss. Does that 231, does that include the amortization of goodwill and intangibles?\nRichie Whitt: No, the amortization would be separate. \nJohn Fox: Okay, and Richie from your comp -- go ahead. \nThomas Gayner: I was just going to say, but it does also include some pretty significant charges related to CATCo.\nJohn Fox: Right. I was just going to ask about that. Have you guys quantified that or not at this time?\nRichie Whitt: We did not quantify it. I mean, I think you can go back in the last quarter and probably get a reasonable estimate of it. \nJeremy Noble: Yeah, what I would say, I think Richie commented on this earlier is, full year CATCo expenses were approximately $50 million, pretty significant amount of that would be non-recurring in nature.\nJohn Fox: Yeah, it's very significant. And did you buy any stock back in the quarter?\nRichie Whitt: We did not. We stopped the repurchase plan back in March.\nJohn Fox: Okay, great. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nMark Dwelle: Hi, good morning. Just a couple that haven't already been addressed. Down in the product services and other segment, there was a $41 million charge related to the Latin America reinsurance segment. Is that a goodwill write off or is that an underwriting loss, the description it wasn't really clear what was happening there?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah, Mark it's Jeremy. Let me try to clarify that. So, going back 2013 when we acquired Altera, we inherited a small, uh, Latin America reinsurance operation, really over the course of the past 24 months, we've been winding down our Latin American operations. And this would be an example as Richard was talking to before, you're not really a core product offering and not really sort of meeting profitability and return targets for us. The last remaining piece of our sort of exit is a sale of a small Brazilian re-insurance company. And we're in sort of active negotiations in that space and hopefully we'd have a transaction, later this year. Because of the intent to sell from an accounting standpoint, we recognize that loss. What's important to reflect is a little bit of the accounting so you'll also see in the quarter, a pretty large CTA gain and other comprehensive income, and the accounting would require us to crystallize the accumulated CTA loss and really classify that into operating income as an operating loss. So we've got that in the reinsurance segment, outside of the combined ratio that 41 million you alluded to, that's largely offset by a corresponding CTA gain because of that reclassification. The actual book loss is pretty small.\nMark Dwelle: Okay, alright. So ultimately it's primarily an accounting. Was there any material amount of premium associated with that, sounds like you had pretty well run it down to a deminimus amount?\nRichie Whitt: Over the last couple of years, it was very deminimus. \nMark Dwelle: Got it. Okay. The second question that I had, you commented on goal of 90 or better combined ratio, which in my recollection is maybe the first time you've ever set such a goal publicly. So, thank you for that. But more specifically, as you contemplate that targeting, would you perceive most of the improvement from here to be primarily loss ratio driven or do you think that there's any meaningful amount of expense ratio savings that can be further generated from here?\nRichie Whitt: Well, both, both. I think there's probably more on the loss ratio side at this point. I made a point of the 85 combined in the fourth quarter, before cat and before COVID. We are hoping there's not another COVID type loss in 2021, and we have significantly reduced our cat exposure by the end of 2020. So I would expect our kind of normalized cat load to be less in 2021. So, I feel like we're there in terms of a run rate to produce 9 or below and then Jeremy spoke about the expense ratio. We continue to scale the business and we're holding the line on our controllable expenses. So, our goal is to drive it lower than the 36 we reported this year.\nMark Dwelle: Got it, thank you. That's very helpful. Last question, we haven't heard enough from Tom yet, so I'm going to ask you a Venture\u2019s question. I mean, obviously this year was a difficult year in a number of senses for the multitude of business units in there. What are the key signposts you're looking for as far as reopening to kind of get the revenues, particularly in the units that saw a revenue declines, to get those back running positively again this year? \nThomas Gayner: Sure. Well, again, amazed and grateful are the words that I would write for what happened in Ventures. When we looked at the economy being shut down in April and May and order books that just disappeared, the recovery that has already taken place is spectacular. And that's a tribute to the management teams that run those businesses and the workforces who just figured out. For instance, HavCo [ph] which makes the wood flooring for trucks, as the gentleman who runs that said you can't make wood floors from home. So that workforce figured out a way to operate safely and make wood floors and capture a pretty good amount of business that started to show up in the second half of the year. The most economically sensitive section of the Ventures Group would be things that are related to transportation and the various trailer businesses. And I can tell you, those businesses are already picking up and the fourth quarter was pretty nice and their order books are way, way better than what they were earlier in the year. So I don't think there's much that I can control about general economic conditions. That'd be like thanking the weatherman for a sunny day, but as the weatherman, I would predict that the conditions are getting better. \nMark Dwelle: Okay. Thank you. That's hopeful and I don\u2019t have any other questions. Thanks. \nOperator: The next question is from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead. \nMark Hughes: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about kind of frequency and severity as you saw it develop through the year, anything related to COVID and the shutdown, and then maybe social inflation you mentioned that as the continuing driver or rate the momentum, do you think there's some pent up demand, is the maybe courts open in 2021?\nOperator: Hello everybody. Please hold. \nRichie Whitt: We think frequency is about the same. In terms of severity, that's really where you see -- that's really where you see the social inflation showing up, the nuclear verdicts, things of that sort. That's why that's part of the reason we're shortening limits. That's part of the reason you buy reinsurance, you try to do things to manage that. And we do believe, the rate increases we're achieving now are running in excess of a trend at this point and they need to. I've said that we need to be at a 90 or less to generate appropriate returns on our capital. And so, that margin that we've been generating has been needed. So, I think frequency we're seeing about the same, severity is where we're seeing it go up.\nMark Hughes: Thank you for that. On the cat exposure, you pointed out how the normalized cat load is than 21. Any other metrics you can share sort of specifics on say premiums related to cat exposure or maximum loss numbers, just to give us a better sense of that change?\nRichie Whitt: I think the best thing I could give you is, each year we sort of work up a cat load in terms of our combined ratio. And Jeremy, keep me honest here was that a bit about three points for 2019, and it's probably less than two, excuse me, for 2020 and it is probably less than two points for 21. \nJeremy Noble: Yeah, for example our Global Re division, that property book I think ended up writing gross maybe $220 million. That's certainly less net, I think that's in the press release. But, that'd be a good example of that a vast majority of that business will not be on the books in 2021.\nMark Hughes: And then if I might just a couple of specific numbers, and I'm sorry if I didn't back into this properly, the expense ratio or the insurance segment, and then the reinsurance segment for Q4? \nJeremy Noble: Yeah, sure. The insurance expense ratio was about a 35 and for re-insurance I think it was about 36.\nMark Hughes: Thank you very much. \nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Mark. \nOperator: And the next question is a follow-up from Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nPhilip Stefano: Yeah, thanks. A quick one on the 90 combined guidance. I got the impression in response to an earlier question that the right way to think about the 90 is a fully developed number, but of course there could be some level of conservatism to the reserving basis on that. I mean, how should we think about this 90 as a reported versus a fully developed number?\nRichie Whitt: 90, I'm thinking in terms of the 90 as reported. So, if we have a margin of six, we obviously will include a margin of safety in both our insurance and re-insurance operations. With that margin of safety I could potentially see us reporting something in excess of the 90 in re-insurance in 2021, and I'm hoping for something less than a 90 in insurance in 2021.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it, understood. And with the ILS commentary in AUM update, I didn't hear Lodgepine mentioned in there. I was hoping you can give a quick update on that? \nRichie Whitt: Yeah. Lodgepine, in terms of results Lodgepine had a terrific year in 2020. We talked a lot about small to medium size events. So it was really frequency in 2020 in terms of the cat losses. None of that really got to the retro portfolios. And so they had a terrific year, mid double-digits returns, on the portfolio. The place that we have fallen short is in terms of raising capital. We are little short in terms of our capital raising and we're hoping to now with a year\u2019s track record, I know, years and a lot, but it is a year\u2019s track record, we're hoping that we can get out there and raise some capital here in the first quarter before the Japanese renewals on 401.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for closing remarks. \nThomas Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. We're pleased to be able to report the results that we did to you. And we look forward to 2021 and chatting with you again next quarter. Thank you all so much. Bye-bye. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you and good morning to everyone and thank you is the key and operative word to start off this message. The 18,000 employees of Markel turned in a wonderful performance in every dimension in 2020 and I just want to start off the call on behalf of Richie and Jeremy and everybody thanking the associates of Markel for their work throughout 2020, it was not an easy year. Markel is a holding company and I think the thing that we hold most dear are our ideas and our values of taking care of our customers and our associates. We think that creates a win, win, win architecture where our associates win by being part of Markel, our customers win by doing business with us, and our shareholders win just when we do this first two things, we produce good returns on capital and we think that is the ultimate form of sustainability.  All three engines of Markel fired in 2020 and provided positive thrust but it might not have seemed that way at various points of the year especially early on, in the early days of the pandemic. The great philosopher Mike Tyson said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. Well, we got punched in the mouth in the early days of the pandemic, but our plan is to build Markel in such a way that we can take a hit, we can get in the ring with Mike Tyson, we can take the punch in the mouth and keep on fighting. That's 2020 in a nutshell, Markel is a resilience machine, our three engines withstood the blows from the early days of 2020, and our 18,000 plus associates adapted and figured out how to recalibrate and accomplish our mission of taking care of our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. I am pleased this morning now to spend a little time with you reviewing the results and with that I am going to turn it over first to Jeremy Noble, our CFO to discuss the numbers. Richie will then talk about our insurance operations. I'll hop back on to talk about investments and ventures and then we'll open it up for your questions. With that Jeremy, thank you. Thank you, Richard, I appreciate it. My comments will be extraordinarily brief this morning. Jeremy has given you the numbers, so I look forward to your questions. In the Ventures area, as Jeremy reported, record year, $2.8 billion of revenues, $367 million of EBITDA, and certainly seven points in the year earlier on the only two words that I can use to describe the performance by the Markel Ventures Group of Companies are amazed and grateful. They have just done a spectacular job of figuring out how to operate in the world in which we live and they've produced record results. And as Jeremy alluded to, that's a record level of profitability even without the acquisitions of Lansing and VSC.  On the investment side, we first and foremost protected our balance sheet and we produced positive returns at the same time following our consistent, historical, disciplined, and sustainable approach. And net all of this, of what's happening in the insurance related businesses, the venture businesses and the investment operations, is that all of those factors combined to put us in a very strong capital position which will enable us to play both offense and defense as we enter into 2021 and I suspect we'll have the opportunity to have both teams on the field at various points during the year. So we're very optimistic, we're very grateful for the results that the 18,000 plus employees of Markel produced over the years. I just wanted to thank everybody for the efforts in an extraordinary year that we did not have a playbook for as we entered into it. But we're pleased to report these results to you and we now look forward to taking your questions. Yeah, there's no doubt that we talked about small businesses being impacted, obviously a little bit harder by the pandemic. So some of that business was not there to renew and maybe the new business stream is not as strong as a result of that. We are definitely in places shortening our limits as a way to manage the portfolio. And so, you're getting a rate increase, but you might actually have less premium because of the shortening of the limits. We measure the pure rate increase and so it doesn't include things like changing terms and conditions or shortening up limits. So there is some drag there but I can't quantify that for you. The reality is, I mean, we're up over double-digits in terms of our rate increases and we're up 13% in growth for the year. So there's a little bit more growth than there is rate increase. So that suggests to me that net, net, net, there is some new business on top of just the rate increases that we're receiving. But there's no doubt there is some drag there. And then in addition, we're always remixing the portfolio and there was over 100 million of business that we exited during 2020 because it wasn't performing to our return hurdles. So, our growth was net of having to get out of some of that business. Sure. We got out of a couple of programs that were underperforming, one in particular, that was probably 70 million or 80 million. We came off of that program during the year. Some of our smaller program business Camps, as an example, social services, very little opportunity for growth, challenged areas in terms of profitability we have gotten out of. And where we are really focused is professional liability, casualty, property, marine and energy where we're growing nicely and our rate increases are not just double-digits, they're mid to high, 15 to 20 sorts of increases. Got out of that as well. Yes. I was just going to say, but it does also include some pretty significant charges related to CATCo. Sure. Well, again, amazed and grateful are the words that I would write for what happened in Ventures. When we looked at the economy being shut down in April and May and order books that just disappeared, the recovery that has already taken place is spectacular. And that's a tribute to the management teams that run those businesses and the workforces who just figured out. For instance, HavCo [ph] which makes the wood flooring for trucks, as the gentleman who runs that said you can't make wood floors from home.

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy and good morning, everyone. As Tom and Jeremy have said, we finished 2020 strong, posting an overall underwriting profit with a 98% combined ratio for the year. While this is not the result we were aiming for as we entered 2020 after recording 360 million of underwriting losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by natural catastrophe events in the third and fourth quarter adding an additional 169 million in underwriting losses, this is an amazing accomplishment.  We finished the year with a fourth quarter in which we recorded a combined ratio of 85% before the effects of COVID and natural catastrophe losses. We achieved strong growth and meaningful rate increases across most of our insurance and reinsurance product lines and saw reductions in our attritional loss ratios across most of our products in the last half of 2020 as the impact of price increases and portfolio management efforts started to materialize. We continue to seek out opportunities to grow and benefit from the positive insurance and reinsurance market environment and to reduce volatility in our underwriting results as we enter 2021.  So now I'll discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations, and insurance linked securities operations. So starting with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for 2020 were up 709 million or 13% and net earned premiums were up 544 million, also 13%. Gross written premiums were up 15% in the fourth quarter. Premium growth for both the quarter and year was driven by continued strong organic and new business growth, along with the impact of rate increases across several product lines, most notably in our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy, and personal line products. Importantly, virtually all of our growth was in our preferred product offerings, as our top line growth was impacted in part by targeted reductions on products and accounts that weren't meeting our profitability goals. We believe our efforts around portfolio construction will continue to improve profitability levels over time.  The combined ratio for the insurance segment in 2020 was 96 versus 93 last year. The three-point increase was driven by losses recognized in 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with several mid-sized cat events that impacted the current year combined ratio by six and three points respectively. The impact from COVID and cat events were partially offset by a three-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio arising from several product lines, most notably in our property, professional liability, and marine and energy product lines due to reduced loss experienced, rate increases, and changes in business days. We also benefited in the current year from a lower expense ratio, driven primarily by the continued growth in net earned premiums as we've sought to keep controllable expenses flat.  Turning to the reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for 2020 were up 17 million or 2% and earned premiums were up 26 million or 3%. Premium growth for the year was driven by growth in our general liability and professional liability lines, partially offset by lower premiums in our credit and surety line. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 104 in both 2020 and 2019. The 2020 combined ratio was impacted by seven points of underwriting losses from COVID-19 and five points from natural catastrophe events versus a ten-point impact from nat cat events in 2019. Excluding the losses from COVID and cat events, the combined ratio decreased due to a lower attritional loss ratio across several product lines, partially offset by less favorable development on prior year losses.  2020 represented the fourth consecutive year of underwriting losses in our reinsurance segment, primarily as a result of unprecedented and significant catastrophe activity over the last four years, along with the impact from COVID-19 in 2020. While there are certainly opportunities in the current market to grow our top line in reinsurance, we're going to be very cautious about growth in the near-term until we are convinced profitability issues have been resolved by a combination of price increases and portfolio management. To illustrate the difference in our strategies in insurance versus reinsurance, over the past three years our insurance gross written premiums have grown at a 13% compound average growth rate versus essentially no growth in reinsurance. Recent results have not been good enough in our reinsurance portfolio, and we've not earned our targeted return on capital. We recognize that reinsurance is a volatile business and volatility is what we are paid to assume is a reinsurer. We will continue to make adjustments to our core casualty and specialty products, and believe we're on track to produce appropriate returns on a smaller, more focused reinsurance portfolio.  So next, I'll go to program services. Gross written premium volume for our state and national program services operations were down 10% to 2.1 billion for the year, driven by the cessation of two large programs earlier in 2020. This was partially offset by new program business added in 2020. As a reminder, almost all of these gross written premiums are ceded to third parties. Program services business continues to perform extremely well, producing consistently strong operating margins. We're also encouraged by new business development opportunities and it is clear that there is rising demand for fronting services to help match insurance risk to capital.  Moving to our ILS operations, our combined ILS operations have a little under 11 billion in net assets under management at December 31, 2020. Revenues from our ILS operations decreased 6% for the year, due primarily to the continued orderly wind down CATCo, which continues to return investor capital as quickly as possible. Before considering amortization expense, the operating loss from our ILS operations in 2020 was wholly attributable to cost to CATCo, the majority of which are non-recurring in nature. For 2021, Nephila has received in excess of 1 billion of new subscriptions to date. This is driven by proven market conditions and in part by opportunities created with the transfer of our Markel Global Property Cat portfolio to Nephila. A portion of this capital was deployed at 1-1 and additional amounts will be deployed at major renewal dates over the course of the year.  Nephila was also able to establish and are working on a new investment vehicle. These include an ESG Impact Fund and Lloyd Syndicate Multiclass Fund. That being said, Nephila was impacted by the elevated level of U.S. nat cat activity in the third and fourth quarters, which impacted their fund performance for the year. When allowing for cat losses, development classes or side pockets, anticipated redemption activity, and the timing of capital allocation from new subscriptions, the total increase to AUM will be tempered to start the year. Going forward, we feel strongly about the prospects for our ILS operations.  I'll finish up with a bit of market commentary and I'm sure there'll be questions afterwards. Trends that we've discussed in past quarters continued in the fourth quarter and after January 1 renewals. We see continuing price momentum in almost all lines. Our insurance rate increases continue to average in low double-digits and move double-digits overall for the 2020 year. Reinsurance, which has lagged primary insurance pricing closed the gap throughout the year, but we're still not as strong as rates being achieved in the primary market. This situation helps further explain our continued double-digit growth in insurance versus roughly flat in reinsurance. While new entrants and incremental capital raises have had an impact around the edges of the market, we believe that pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, elevated cat activity, social inflation, COVID-19 losses, and economic uncertainty are likely to persist throughout 2021.  This hardening market has nothing to do with a shortage of capital. Unlike previous hard markets, capital was actually plentiful. The factors I just mentioned are driving the market and all capital both new and old must face that reality as they price business. We also believe our business will continue to benefit as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. While large and mid-sized business has shown reasonable resiliency to the economic disruptions, small business, which is a meaningful part of our portfolio, have been adversely impacted. As the vaccine rollouts gained traction, we expect small business activity to rebound, getting pent up demands in the economy. We enter 2021 well-positioned and excited about our opportunities. We're laser focused on our goal to deliver a 90% combined ratio or lower for the year with double-digit top line growth and we're off to a fast start in January and here in early February. Thanks for your time today. And now I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it really was all about the aggregate cover and some of that benefit from the aggregate cover getting allocated to COVID. So gross reserves were unchanged. Totally agree with you in terms of the uncertainty around COVID reserves. I think in terms of the two areas where we have exposure, debt cancellation, I think -- at this point I think we have a pretty good handle on the debt cancellation. And I don't expect a whole lot of volatility around that. The business interruption in the UK, again, now that we've got the Supreme Court decision, I think most of the areas are laid out and it's a matter of moving to final settlement with the insurers. And I think we feel reasonably comfortable about those reserves. But again, this is first time any of us is seeing this situation. And then in the U.S., I know there's been a couple of verdicts that have probably been adverse, you would say, adverse to the insurance industry. But the reality is the 50, 60 or so verdicts that are out there have been positive for the insurance industry in terms of what constitutes physical damage and upholding of virus exclusions, communicable disease exclusions. So, there's still volatility and potential risk out there. But, we know we're nine months later into it, 10 months later into it, we know more about it today than we did when it all started. And I think we feel as good as we can about the reserves. Yeah, I think flattish is the right way to think about growth in the short run for reinsurance. Obviously, we've transferred roughly 200 million of catastrophe business over to Nephila. So, all things being equal, you would expect gross written premium to be down a bit this year in terms of our casualty, professional, and specialty portfolios. The one thing that is happening, that could change that a bit is just price increases. We could put the same lines down on treaties but end up with more premium because of the price increases. So I don't expect significant growth, obviously we've got over -- we would have to overcome the 200 million that's coming out. We may not be down the full 200 million. We could be something short of that, just simply because of price increases on treaties. The first part of your question about a profit, I don't -- I'm not real sure what you're talking about there, I'm sorry, Phil. We did have a portion of the exposure to the Olympics. We wrote a portion of that. If the Olympics were ultimately canceled, we don't believe it would have much impact to our reserves. We sort of took the position that it very well could be canceled in terms of setting up our reserves. So we wouldn't expect much change to our reserves if, in fact, they ended up having to cancel. You know, I think capital I'd say it's about, one to one in terms of the capital and we need the same 90. We need the same 90 combined on the reinsurance. I mean, actually, I'd like to see it be a little bit lower. I said 90 or better in 2021 and -- now, let me just say, we're coming off some tough performance the last few years. I don't know that our report, put the reserves up at a 90 initially. We will have a margin of safety. But I want to be damn sure it's ultimately going to prove out to a 90 and so that's the goal. Yeah, I did, I do. One of those accounts was one that they received, they were upgraded back to A from A minus and so we knew all along eventually that program would go away. We actually were fortunate to keep it longer than we thought. So that was always going to be one that was going to take a little while to replace. The new business pipeline is full right now. We really have seen a pickup in activity, so I think we'll grow in 2021. No, the amortization would be separate. We did not quantify it. I mean, I think you can go back in the last quarter and probably get a reasonable estimate of it. We did not. We stopped the repurchase plan back in March. Over the last couple of years, it was very deminimus. Well, both, both. I think there's probably more on the loss ratio side at this point. I made a point of the 85 combined in the fourth quarter, before cat and before COVID. We are hoping there's not another COVID type loss in 2021, and we have significantly reduced our cat exposure by the end of 2020. So I would expect our kind of normalized cat load to be less in 2021. So, I feel like we're there in terms of a run rate to produce 9 or below and then Jeremy spoke about the expense ratio. We continue to scale the business and we're holding the line on our controllable expenses. So, our goal is to drive it lower than the 36 we reported this year. We think frequency is about the same. In terms of severity, that's really where you see -- that's really where you see the social inflation showing up, the nuclear verdicts, things of that sort. That's why that's part of the reason we're shortening limits. That's part of the reason you buy reinsurance, you try to do things to manage that. And we do believe, the rate increases we're achieving now are running in excess of a trend at this point and they need to. I've said that we need to be at a 90 or less to generate appropriate returns on our capital. And so, that margin that we've been generating has been needed. So, I think frequency we're seeing about the same, severity is where we're seeing it go up. I think the best thing I could give you is, each year we sort of work up a cat load in terms of our combined ratio. And Jeremy, keep me honest here was that a bit about three points for 2019, and it's probably less than two, excuse me, for 2020 and it is probably less than two points for 21. Thanks, Mark. 90, I'm thinking in terms of the 90 as reported. So, if we have a margin of six, we obviously will include a margin of safety in both our insurance and re-insurance operations. With that margin of safety I could potentially see us reporting something in excess of the 90 in re-insurance in 2021, and I'm hoping for something less than a 90 in insurance in 2021. Yeah. Lodgepine, in terms of results Lodgepine had a terrific year in 2020. We talked a lot about small to medium size events. So it was really frequency in 2020 in terms of the cat losses. None of that really got to the retro portfolios. And so they had a terrific year, mid double-digits returns, on the portfolio. The place that we have fallen short is in terms of raising capital. We are little short in terms of our capital raising and we're hoping to now with a year's track record, I know, years and a lot, but it is a year's track record, we're hoping that we can get out there and raise some capital here in the first quarter before the Japanese renewals on 401."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Following year that reflected significant volatility and widespread impacts attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are proud of the results we delivered across all three of our engines in 2020, which demonstrate the strength and resilience of our businesses. Our underwriting operations delivered an underwriting profit despite elevated levels of catastrophic events and significant losses attributable to the global pandemic as we benefited from achieving meaningful rate increases and growth in new business. Our Markel Ventures operations saw strong top and bottom line performance amid challenging economic conditions and we achieved solid investment returns despite volatile market conditions and historically low interest rates.  Looking at our operating results, gross written premiums were $7.2 billion for the year, compared to $6.4 billion in 2019, an increase of 11%. This increase was attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $6 billion, an increase of 13% compared to a year ago. This premium growth is attributable to both new business and improved pricing within our professional liability and general liability product lines, as well as our personal lines and marine and energy product lines. Gross written premiums with our reinsurance segment were consistent with 2019 at roughly $1.1 billion. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2020, which is down one point from 84% a year ago. Earned premiums increased 11% to $5.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2020 was a 98 compared to a 94 last year. For the fourth quarter 2020, we reported an 89 combined ratio compared to a 93 a year ago. Our full year 2020 combined ratio included 360 million or six points of underwriting losses attributed to the COVID-19 and 169 million or three points attributed to natural catastrophes. This compares to $100 million or two points of catastrophe losses in 2019. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 and natural catastrophes, our combined ratio for 2020 improved due to a three-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and one-point reduction in our expense ratio arising from improved performance within our insurance segment in 2020 compared to 2019. With regards to prior year loss reserve development consistent with our reserve philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $606 million in 2020, compared to $535 million in 2019.  Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included a net income or $618 million in 2020, compared to $1.6 billion in 2019, and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of equity securities, which experienced significant market volatility during the year. The impact of significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio in the first quarter, driven by unfavorable market value movements resulting from the onset of the pandemic, were more than offset by increases in the fair value of our equity portfolio over the last three quarters of 2020. As I mentioned in previous calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected and we may continue to see volatility in the equity markets due in part to economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. With regards to net investment income we reported $372 million in 2020 compared to $452 million last year. The decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates, as well as lower holdings and lower yields on fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $353 million net of taxes during 2020, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from declines in interest rates.  Now, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $2.8 billion for 2020, compared to $2.1 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April, and VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the contributions of Lansing and VSC operating revenues within our Markel Venture's operations decreased compared to 2019 as a result of lower sales volumes attributed to the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $367 million for 2020, compared to $264 million a year ago, reflecting the contributions of Lansing and VSC, as well as growth and improved operating results at certain of our businesses. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate for 2020 was 17%, compared to 21% in 2019. The lower effective tax rate in 2020 was primarily attributable to a tax benefit that was recognized in 2020 for cumulative losses on certain investments we sold. We reported net income to common shareholders of $798 million for 2020 compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.8 billion a year ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders for 2020 was $1.2 billion, compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for 2020, compared to $1.3 billion for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters, as well as greater cash flows for Markel Ventures given increased earnings. And that's an asset to the holding company of $4.1 billion at the end of December compared to $4 billion at the end of 2019. The increase in the holding company invested assets was due in part to the proceeds from our May preferred shares offering offset by funds used to acquire Lansing earlier in the year.  Total shareholder's equity stood at $12.8 billion at the end of December, compared to $11.1 billion at the end of 2019. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet. We are well positioned to be opportunistic around deploying capital, including to support growth in our insurance operations, given the attractive opportunities we are seeing in the specialty insurance marketplace. With that I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses. Hey, Phil it is Jeremy. I'll start and Rich, you might join in. It was pretty modest reduction and actually we didn't change our gross COVID loss reserve estimates. That is actually a reflection of a little bit of additional benefit from reinsurance. And part of that is associated with our kind of enterprise aggregate covers that we would have in place. It would have been influenced by the fact that we had elevated levels of nat cat losses. So really the only thing we reflected was a pretty modest amount of additional reinsurance recoveries. We didn't change the gross reserves. Rich, I don't know if you want to comment on it. Yeah, hey Phil. The expense ratio, you're right. In the quarter, the expense ratio in reinsurance was up. It is sort of personnel related expenses. Part of that is the costs associated with our decision to exit out of property within the Markel Global RE division. So, much more personnel costs from that than anything on the kind of the profit side. That's for all of P&C. One other line would be the personal accident contingency in the international space... Yeah, we're really continuing to work on the expense ratio. It is a great point that we've seen that come down. Our variable component of the ratio really is pretty unchanged. So most of the benefit you see, year-over-year is us holding the direct and controllable expenses probably flat while sort of in insurance, growing net earned premium 13%. We think that's a trend that we can continue to see as we grow. So we've been really focused on trying to hold it and control the expenses flat and scaling off our operations that are sort of in place. So we've seen that really measured over a period of time. I mean, you can you can go back for a number of years and really see the movement in the expense ratio. So we're going to continue to work on that and I think we can do a bit better than even where it was for 2020. And John, it is Jeremy. It should be a little bit more capital efficient too, I mean that was part of the decision to sort of exit property and sort of focus on doing property sort of through, you know, Nephila's offering. Obviously nat cat on the property reinsurance side is a much more capital intensive product line. Yeah, what I would say, I think Richie commented on this earlier is, full year CATCo expenses were approximately $50 million, pretty significant amount of that would be non-recurring in nature. Yeah, Mark it's Jeremy. Let me try to clarify that. So, going back 2013 when we acquired Altera, we inherited a small, uh, Latin America reinsurance operation, really over the course of the past 24 months, we've been winding down our Latin American operations. And this would be an example as Richard was talking to before, you're not really a core product offering and not really sort of meeting profitability and return targets for us. The last remaining piece of our sort of exit is a sale of a small Brazilian re-insurance company. And we're in sort of active negotiations in that space and hopefully we'd have a transaction, later this year. Because of the intent to sell from an accounting standpoint, we recognize that loss. What's important to reflect is a little bit of the accounting so you'll also see in the quarter, a pretty large CTA gain and other comprehensive income, and the accounting would require us to crystallize the accumulated CTA loss and really classify that into operating income as an operating loss. So we've got that in the reinsurance segment, outside of the combined ratio that 41 million you alluded to, that's largely offset by a corresponding CTA gain because of that reclassification. The actual book loss is pretty small. Yeah, for example our Global Re division, that property book I think ended up writing gross maybe $220 million. That's certainly less net, I think that's in the press release. But, that'd be a good example of that a vast majority of that business will not be on the books in 2021. Yeah, sure. The insurance expense ratio was about a 35 and for re-insurance I think it was about 36."

Good morning and welcome. We apologize for the delay in starting the call this morning. We understand that one of the numbers that was distributed was incorrect and connected you to the replay which of course has not happened yet. This is the actual call. We have sent out an email with the correct number and we see a roster has been assembled and something of a slowed fashion. We apologize for that error on our part. We hope others are able to join us in process and that the replay will work as functioned and we are grateful that you are here this morning.  So, good morning and welcome. As is stated this is Tom Gayner, I am here today with our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. We are glad you have joined us and we look forward to briefing you on current conditions as well as answering your questions. I'm not telling you anything you don't know when I say that 2020 remains unlike any other year. The systemic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and all that follow in its wake remain immense and unrelenting. That said, I could not be more proud of the efforts of everyone in this organization to truly serve our customers, our associates, and our shareholders in the face of adversity. We've provided for claims and financial assistance to our policyholder customers to cover substantial losses and economic costs. Those losses stem not just from the things you see in the headlines regarding the pandemic, but also a spate of natural catastrophes such as more hurricanes than hurricane memes, wildfires, a major derecho, and ongoing and recurring events and circumstances that we see regularly in our insurance operations.  We continue to provide necessary and desirable products and services throughout our Markel ventures operations. That includes building the machines that bake bread, things don\u2019t get much more basic or necessary than that and since man does not live by bread alone, we also produce and provide everything from medical services, housing, houseplants to brighten your day, and trailers to convey everything from industrial gases to the car you drive. We make truck floors to keep the products you need from falling out of the bottom of the trailer, technology consulting services to manage and keep track of it all, and many other items as well. And by the way, we also provide fire suppression services to keep it all from catching on fire. We're doing our best to keep our associates safe and gainfully employed throughout these trying times. We're also working to produce financial results which create the capital we need to be able to serve our customers and associates.  Over many years and as displaced to the first nine months of 2020 we've built a system at Markel to be a resilient and robust company. We work to serve and dependably honor the promises we make. We've built a diversified three engine machine consisting of our insurance, investment, and Markel Ventures operations. Those components work together to fulfill our purpose each and every day. We're delighted to be able to report our 2020 year-to-date progress in doing so this morning. Clearly, work remains to be done while our insurance operations remain mildly in the red to the year-to-date, we've recovered dramatically since the first quarter shock losses we recognized at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've accelerated our pace of making tough but necessary decisions to increase the durability and quality of our insurance operations, which will be measured by improved profitability and our investment operations for reporting profitable results for the first nine months. While that is always too short a time frame to draw conclusions about investing, those results continue a multi-year pattern of conservative and profitable investing. Our investments protect our balance sheet and stand behind the promises we make and they also produce appropriate returns.  At our ventures operations we produced outstanding results so far in 2020. The leaders of the ventures businesses adapted and figured out ways to surmount unprecedented conditions and circumstances. I am grateful and amazed for their work and accomplishments. The performance of our three engines demonstrates the resilience and the spirit of Markel to fulfill our purpose of serving our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. We believe in a win, win, win as the fundamental architecture underlying Markel, and we're pleased to be able to share how that played out in the unprecedented conditions of 2020 today. Even more importantly, we hope this update provides you with a shared optimism of how we will continue to evolve and build even more resilience and sustainability going forward. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to review the financial details of the year-to-date. Richard will then follow with some commentary on our insurance and insurance linked securities operations and then I will speak briefly about our ventures and investment engines. Following that, we will take the questions. With that Jeremy. \nA - Jeremy A. Noble: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Our underwriting, investing in Markel Ventures results continue to be heavily influenced by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But fortunately we saw positive contributions from each of our three engines during the third quarter. Our insurance operations produced an underwriting profit despite elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses, as well as increases to reserves related to the pandemic reflecting the strong underlying performance of our business. Our Markel Ventures operations delivered meaningful profits demonstrating their resilience despite economic uncertainty and our investment portfolio also saw gains in mid-volatile market conditions.  Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $5.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $4.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 10%. This increase was attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $4.5 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the 2019 period. This premium growth is attributable to both our growth in our -- and more favorable rates within our professional liability and general liability product lines, as well as growth in our personal product lines. Gross written premiums within our reinsurance segment were consistent with the 2019 period at roughly $960 million. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2020, which is down 1 point from 84% in 2019, and our premiums for the first nine months increased 10% to 4.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment.  Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2020 was a 101 compared to a 95 in 2019. For the third quarter of 2020 we reported a 97 combined ratio compared to a 94 a year ago. Our 2020 combined ratio included nine points of underwriting losses attributed to COVID-19 for the nine-month period, compared to three points for the quarter. As I've discussed for the past two quarters, we recognized $325 million of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses during the first quarter of this year. For those policies and contracts were COVID-19 was identified as the proximate direct cause of loss. During the third quarter, we increased our loss estimates on these coverages by $32 million and also recognized $15 million of losses on our trade credit product line arising from the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic. As a reminder, our losses for COVID-19 are primarily attributed to business written within our international insurance operations and are primarily associated with coverages for event cancellations and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions surrounding COVID-19 which, among other things includes assumptions around coverages, liability, reinsurance, protection, duration, and loss mitigation factors, as well as the fact that the economic impacts of a pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates continue to be subject to a wide range of variability.  During the third quarter, a test case of a sample of business interruption coverages for policies written in the United Kingdom was completed with the court's judgment finding mostly in the favor of policyholders. This ruling was most impactful to certain estimates in our reinsurance segment, where we increased our estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses of certain treaties following increase in estimated losses by our [indiscernible]. Within our insurance segment, the ruling did not meaningfully impact the reserves previously established for business interruption coverage, given the assumptions we initially made in our policy terms and conditions. Our estimates at September 30, 2020 also reflect additional data gathered through increased claims reporting and change in our expected duration of the pandemic, which was most impactful to our event cancellation coverages.  In addition to the explicit provision of losses recognized during the quarter on a trade credit product line as the overall effects of the pandemic continue to evolve, further losses indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic are possible and may also emerge within our professional liability and worker\u2019s compensation product lines, among others including our reinsurance product lines. To date we've not seen any other evidence of significant incurred losses increasing for these secondary exposures. Our underwriting results for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 also reflect losses attributable to natural catastrophes. Our 2020 combined ratio included $101 million or two points of underwriting losses from Hurricane Laura, Sally, Isaias, as well as the Midwest [indiscernible] and wildfires in the Western U.S. Compared to our 2019 combined ratio which included $43 million or one point of underwriting losses from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our reserve and philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably $235 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to favorable prior year development of $337 million in 2019.  Turning to our investment results, following the significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the first quarter, we have seen meaningful recoveries in the second and third quarters. Net investment losses for the first nine months of 2020 were $231 million, compared to net investment gains of $1.1 billion last year with year-over-year decline of 1.3 billion. As I have mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected and we may continue to see volatility in equity markets due in part to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. With regards to net investment income we reported $274 million the first nine months of 2020 compared to $339 million a year ago. The decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates and lower holdings of fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $298 million net of taxes during 2020, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from declines in interest rates during the first nine months of the year.  Now to cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment, revenues from Markel Ventures surpassed $2 billion through the first nine months of 2020 compared to $1.6 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April, and the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the contributions of Lansing and VSC in 2020 operating revenues in our Markel Ventures operations decreased compared to 2019 as a result of decreased demand attributed to the economic and social disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $284 million for the first nine months of 2020 compared to $219 million last year, reflecting the contribution of Lansing and VSC, as well as growth and improved operating results in certain of our businesses.  Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 was not meaningful to the small pre-tax loss in the period. The effective tax rate was 22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and the estimated annual effective tax rate for both periods was 21%. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $31 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to net income to shareholders of $1.3 billion a year ago. And when combined with the contribution of the increase in net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio, comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months of 2020 was $260 million compared to $1.6 billion a year ago.  Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to $712 million in 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. Invested assets of our holding company was $3.8 billion at the end of September compared to $4 million at the end of 2019. A change in holding company invested assets reflects funds used to acquire Lansing, as well as a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, both of which were partially offset by proceeds from our May 2020 preferred shares offering. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $11.9 billion at the end of September, compared to $11.1 billion at year end. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality investment grade securities with an average rating of AA, our debt to total capital ratio at the end of September was 23%, down slightly from 24% at year-end. We have no unsecured senior notes maturing until July 2022. We believe we are well positioned to meet our ongoing capital liquidity needs, including supporting the growth in our insurance operations as we expect to continue to see attractive opportunities in the specialty insurance marketplace. With that I will turn it over to Richie, to talk more about our insurance businesses. \nRichard R. Whitt, III: Thanks Jeremy and good morning everyone. As Tom's already said, the year has -- and we saw the continuation of the unpredictable rollercoaster year that is 2020 in the third quarter. Despite all that our insurance operations continued to grow nicely and we obtained meaningful rate increases in almost all our lines. Our third quarter was also impacted by a series of small and medium sized cats as Jeremy mentioned, for which we recorded an aggregate 101 million of underwriting losses in the quarter and those were related to multiple hurricanes Laura, Sally, Isaias, the derecho, and the Western wildfires. As regards COVID-19 losses in the third quarter of 2020 we increased that provision to 374 million, that was up from our original 325 million provision that we established in the first quarter. While we have revised many of our original assumptions with the availability of additional information and some of those have been positive, some of those have been negative, the largest driver for the increase in our direct estimates this quarter related to the UK High Court ruling on the FCA business interruption test case that the impact of that ruling impacted our estimates within our reinsurance segment.  There were also some increases required, as we now expect the impact of COVID-19 to be felt into the first half of 2021 that specifically impacts event cancellation business. As part of the third quarter 2000 -- of COVID-19 provision we also recorded 15 million of estimated losses in our trade credit product line within our insurance operations, and those claims were related to indirect economic impact from COVID-19. We're not a but for company at Markel. Cat losses over the past four years, including 2020 COVID-19 losses have significantly impacted all of our insurance, reinsurance, and ILS businesses. As a consequence, we've missed our underwriting profitability goals over that four-year period and as a result we've implemented many key strategic changes over the last several quarters designed to reduce the number of but for items that could potentially impact our future results.  We believe the changes we have made and will continue to make will reduce the volatility of our insurance business results going forward. Given the strength of the current market and pricing trends and the unique capabilities we have assembled, we're bullish about our opportunity to perform and put more points on the board moving forward. Make no mistake, we're realists and this is insurance and but for events are going to happen. Our goal is to lessen their impact and deliver stronger underwriting results to account for the inevitable events that will occur.  Now, I'd like to discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations, and insurance linked securities operations. So I'll kick off with the insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the quarter were up 96 million or 7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. For the nine months, premiums were up 503 million or 13%. Premium growth for both the quarter and nine months was driven by continued organic growth and rate increases in our professional liability and general liability products, along with growth in our personal line product lines. For the quarter ended September 30th, these increases were partially offset by lower gross written premiums within certain of our specialty programs due to lower economic activity related to COVID-19 and due to active portfolio management, where we have discontinued writing certain underperforming lines and programs.  We're taking the opportunity in this market to remix our portfolio to our most profitable lines of business. The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 94 for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 92 last year. That two point increase in the combined ratio was driven by a five point increase in the impact of cat losses and one point of losses attributed to COVID-19 exposures, partially offset by lower attritional loss ratio and a lower expense ratio. The decrease in the attritional loss ratio due to decreases in our general liability and property product lines driven again by premium rate increases.  The insurance segment combined ratio for the first nine months was 100% versus 94% for the same period a year ago. The six point increase in the combined ratio was driven primarily by nine points of loss attributed to COVID-19 exposures and two point increase from the impact of cat losses. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in favorable development on prior accident years losses primarily in our professional liability and product -- property product lines, and a lower attritional loss ratio across several product lines due in part to premium rate increases and lower expense ratio. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and year-to-date within our insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior year\u2019s loss ratio.  Moving to the reinsurance segment, a few weeks ago we announced that we are creating one center of expertise for the global property cat reinsurance market by closing our Markel global property cat unit and having Nephila become Markel\u2019s single point of entry for serving the property cat reinsurance market. This move allows us to more fully leverage Nephila\u2019s market leading competitive position while also generating operational efficiencies. We believe that the companies that will win in the future are those who most efficiently connect risk with capital, and this strategic move is going to help us do that in the property cat market. Going forward Markel global REIT will increase its focus on underwriting and growing its casualty in specialty lines under the continued leadership of Jed Rhoads, President and Chief Underwriting Officer.  Gross written premiums for both the quarter and year decreased slightly compared to the same periods in 2019. In the quarter we saw higher gross premiums in our general liability lines due primarily to new business written and higher rates on that business, offset by lower premiums in our worker's compensation and property lines due to lower premium adjustments and lower renewal premiums within workers compensation. And the unfavorable impact of renewal timing within property. As mentioned previously, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant deals and the timing of renewals. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 116 for the third quarter compared to 103 last year. That 13 point increase in the combined ratio was driven by three point increase from the impact of cat losses and a 15 point increase due to losses attributed to COVID-19, partially offset by more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves. The increase in favorable prior year loss development was due to favorable development in our professional liability and worker\u2019s compensation product lines this year versus adverse development that was experienced last year.  The reinsurance segment combined ratio for the first nine months was 106 versus 99 for the same period a year ago. A seven point increase in the combined ratio was driven by one point increase from the impact of cat losses and a 10 point increase due to losses attributed to COVID-19. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio and more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves. The increase in favorable prior year loss development is due to more favorable development in our property product line partially offset by adverse development on our public entity product line in 2020.  Next, I'm going to touch on program services and our ILS operations. As a reminder amounts from our program services in ILS operations are reported within services and other revenues expenses within our operating results. So starting with State National, gross written premium volume for State National\u2019s program service operations were down in both the quarter and year-to-date basis that was driven by the runoff of one large program and the end in force cancellation of another large program, which resulted in a onetime unfavorable premium adjustment in the first quarter of this year. While gross written premium is down as a result of these two programs, we've seen encouraging new business activity and we have found a number of new programs that are coming online as we move forward. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium in our program services division is ceded. Ceding fee revenues were also down for both the quarter and the year due to the lower gross written premium volume over the past few quarters.  Moving to our insurance linked securities operations, our combined ILS operations have roughly 10.6 billion in net assets under management and as of September 30th. Revenues from our ILS operations decreased 29% from the prior year\u2019s quarter and 8% for the nine-month period. Both the quarter and year-to-date periods were impacted by lower management fees at CATCo due to lower AUM from winding down the operations and reduction in management fees charged during the wind down. Nephila revenues were down for the quarter due to lower investment management fees as a result of some redemptions in 2020 and an increase in side pocket assets on which management fees are deferred until released. Obviously, the cats that occurred in the third quarter, we had to set up loss reserves for those as well as side pockets, and that impacted management fee income. For the year Nephila revenues are up with the decrease of Nephila investment management fees more than offset by higher revenues from their NGA operations. Operating expenses from our ILS operations increased for both the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year due to the impact of the legal settlement in the CATCo operations. Higher operating expenses associated with the growth in our Nephila NGA operations and startup costs associated with our large line operation.  I'll finish with a little bit of market commentary and obviously happy to pick that up when we get to questions. The trends that we've been discussing in the previous quarters continued in the third quarter. We see continued price momentum in almost all lines and we believe that this pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, elevated cat activity, social inflation, COVID-19 losses, and economic uncertainty as a result are all likely to persist throughout 2021. We also believe our businesses will benefit as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. While large and medium sized businesses have shown resiliency to the economic disruption, small businesses which are a meaningful part of our portfolio, have definitely been adversely impacted.  To sum it up, after a brutal start to the year with COVID-19 losses, we now have an opportunity to finish 2020 with an underwriting profit. We're going to need to push hard over these last nine weeks to achieve that goal. I want to thank all of our marketing employees who've worked so hard under difficult conditions to give us this opportunity. I want to thank you for your time today and now I'd like to turn it over to Tom. \nThomas S. Gayner: Thank you, Richard. In our investing operations we earned 0.8% on our equity portfolio and 5.4% on our fixed income holdings for a total return of 3.8% after all allocated expenses and FX effects. I am pleased with positive returns in the current environment. Strategically, I believe that the most important role for investments at this point is to preserve and protect the balance sheet of Markel. Given our views about the general level of trade-offs between risk and return on offer today, we believe that our current focus on high quality and liquidity preserve options to make different investment decisions in a different environment. The opportunity cost of our stance seems very low to me. We don't think that we would get paid appropriately for taking meaningful credit, duration, or many other types of risk right now. As such will stay relatively liquid and ready and able to deploy cash more aggressively when we see the opportunity to earn appropriate returns and compensation for doing so.  In our ventures operations I want to be clear, the news is excellent. The managers and teams of the ventures businesses continue to respond superbly to rapidly changing and disrupted business conditions. I am grateful and amazed at their skills, professionalism and dedication to their associates and their customers. For the first nine months, revenues of ventures grew 28% to just over 2 billion, compared to 1.56 billion a year ago. EBITDA for the nine months increased 29% to 284 million, compared to 219 million a year ago. This record setting financial performance was broad based. While this is the first full quarter of results from our most recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, the entire group demonstrated resiliency and the value of diversification.  We operate an array of different industrial and service businesses that are market leaders in what they do. They serve a wide variety of customers and experience economic cyclicality and variability from many factors. We would normally expect volatility from their results, not unlike what we experience from our investment portfolio when we look at short-term timeframes. That said I think this year's results stand as a dramatic validation of the value of Markel Ventures to the overall purpose and future of the Markel Corporation. For your reference, I checked my notes from the third quarter year-to-date conference call from five years ago in 2015, and that year we reported revenues from Markel Ventures of 784 million for the first nine months and EBITDA of 76 billion. I don't remember the exact economic circumstances and conditions of 2015, but I'm pretty sure it didn't include dealing with a worldwide pandemic. Our efforts to build an enduring and resilient system at Markel continue to unfold. I'm hopeful that the evidence we've offered you this morning about our short-term and long-term progress provides you with some confidence in our win, win, win mindset as we seek to build one of the world's great companies. With that, Emily, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor, we'd love to answer some of your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nPhilip Stefano: Yeah, thanks and good morning. Just going back to the insurance business and the premium volume, I guess I was surprised that the growth had decelerated from the second quarter and it feels like part of the explanation is that we're taking the opportunity in the market to remix some lines of business. Maybe you can help us think about the extent to which this pressured top line growth, how long may this remixing take and look just given the opportunity in the market and the extent of pricing what are your early thoughts on 2021, why would we not see double-digit growth next year?\nJeremy A. Noble: Sure. Thanks, Bill. Yeah, third quarter there were a lot of different things impacting the third quarter, but one in particular was I mean, we are taking the opportunity to remix and really focus on growing what we call our green classes, the most profitable classes. So we've become -- we've been very aggressive I think this year in terms of moving away from business that wasn't meeting our profitability goals, closing some of those down, closing down programs that we didn't see meeting our goals. And some of that's starting to add up and that impacted the third quarter. Also in the third quarter, July 1 is a big date for us and we had a really good July 1. August, September, they tend to be less busy months for us and that sort of continued this year. So all in all, I'm very pleased with the growth we showed in the third quarter, given all the moving parts and all the things we are doing. Also, it's fair to say, the economic struggles have impacted, I think, small business to a greater extent than maybe larger businesses. And we saw the massive amount of stimulus that was put into the economy in the first six months, that wasn't there in the third quarter. And I think some of that had been used to pay premiums in the first two quarters by some businesses. So we saw a little bit of that in the third quarter, but I'm not particularly concerned about it. We've seen a few of our numbers so far for October and I would tell you, they're very strong. So, you say why wouldn't we grow double-digits in 2021, that's certainly going to be our goal to grow double-digits in 2021.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay, got it. And sticking with insurance and understand and appreciate that you're not a but for company. But when I look at the underlying loss ratio, but for cat losses in COVID, there was a pretty good improvement in that attritional performance. Can you help us thinking about the potential contributions of rate versus trend, any COVID frequency benefit from a lack of economic development, and the remix in the business, presumably that's going to have a benefit as well. So, if you can just kind of bifurcate all these moving pieces to help us understand what's going on here? \nRichard R. Whitt, III: I'll do the best I can. We've gotten to a point where our year-to-date rate increases are double digit, low double digits at this point. So, rate is certainly a part of it. The remixing is also a part of it. We are growing the most in the lines of business that we again call our green classes, which are our most profitable classes. We are shrinking classes and you saw that some in the third quarter that we haven't seen the profitability that we would like to see. So, all those things are at play. And yes, we saw a very nice decrease in the attritional loss ratio so far in the year. And the goal is to make sure but for events, don't stop that from being, you know, what the result looks like as we go into 2021. So, unfortunately for the last four years, there's been a lot of cat events that have prevented what has been some pretty nice underlying performance, has prevented that from showing up in our combined ratio. And so, we've been taking a lot of steps to mitigate and hopefully reduce the number of those but for events.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay, and last one for me and then I will re-queue. I was just hoping you could provide a little context on your appetite to grow reinsurance in the potential outlook for 411 [ph]?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Well, obviously now Markel\u2019s global reach is going to be focused on casualty and specialty lines, and we do think there is an opportunity in the casualty and specialty lines to grow. We're seeing rate increases. I talked about we're seeing increases in our general liability reinsurance programs. And some of that or some of that is obviously new business. We're riding, but some of that increase is also just underlying rate increases in the primary business. We're going to be cautious then. We haven't seen the profitability we have wanted to see in those two areas over the last couple of years. So first and foremost is making sure it's profitable and once we're convinced it's profitable, we'll look to grow it in this environment.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next speaker is Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Please go ahead. \nJeff Schmitt : Hi, good morning. Could you speak to the M&A environment for Markel Ventures, I guess I'm wondering if the tough economic conditions are just sort of creating opportunities where some targets may be temporarily impaired, looking for a partner, I don't know if you're -- if you do those types of situations or other opportunities popping up here in this environment?\nThomas S. Gayner: Thanks, Jeff. This is Tom. I would say there's a lot of M&A being done, but not at prices that we're going to do it. Frankly, over the last three or four years, we've not made a lot of outgoing calls or solicited things, but some businesses have been attracted to the long term nature of Markel so, we have grown almost in spite of ourselves. We observe a lot of transactions and we're rubbing hair off our head, scratching our head, looking at the valuation. So I think the circumstances you lay out will probably happen someday but we're kind of watching the parade go by.\nJeff Schmitt : Okay, and then on the Lansing acquisition, obviously revenue is up a ton from that deal, but profits in Markel Ventures were up a lot too, is that from Lansing I guess it was building products or is that struggling now so we could see profitability pick up?\nThomas S. Gayner: No, yeah, I want to reiterate that that profitability is across the board. So, yeah, everybody's feeling COVID in one way or another but again, I just take my hats off to the managers and people at the Markel Ventures operations. They've done a -- just grateful and amazed are the two words that accurately describe the circumstance. So that's not concentrated in any one place. Obviously, the revenue pick-up is pretty big for Lansing because that is a business where I mean, it's distribution kind of business. So revenues are disproportionately high compared to EBITDA relative to the rest of the Markel Venture set of businesses. The returns on capital would be similar, but it's across the board. The group is doing very well.\nJeff Schmitt : Okay, and just one more on the insurance segment, I guess the [indiscernible] I think you referenced in the Q that a program was put in to run off there I think affected the retention amount. What program was that, what was the size of that program?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Well, we put a handful of programs and lines of business into runoff that were not performing. The particular one that I think that was mentioned there was being referred to was a program. It was a program for municipals and it had a heavy property exposure in it that had really not performed well. And so we chose to walk away from that. I think the impact in the quarter was $20 million, $30 million if I am not mistaken. \nJeremy A. Noble: Not so much to gross yet. I mean, I think for a period of time so that program transitions we're sort of serving in the front end capacity. So it influences the net retention versus what we've seen so far on the gross written premium. \nRichard R. Whitt, III: Yeah, Jeremy's right. We're still fronting that for the next carrier at this moment. So it hasn't impacted our growth that much at this point, but we're not retaining it net. So over time that will come through as well.\nThomas S. Gayner: And that's a good example where I think we will find the opportunity to kind of make up for that premium reduction by focusing on the profitable classes that we're seeing opportunities.\nJeff Schmitt : Right, okay. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Good morning. A couple of questions, the reorganization or change in the property reinsurance business that's going to Nephila, just talk about that in a little more detail in particular I guess what I'm curious about is, is that effective for one-one, is it effective immediately and in general terms about how many millions of premiums are impacted, kind of maybe using this year, year-to-date as a run rate or something like that?\nJeremy A. Noble: Sure, sure, Mark. It's effective 4011 [ph] so no 11 business will be renewed on Markle's books. And if those clients are interested, Nephila will offer renewal quotes on that business. It's about 200 million of premium. It's obviously cat driven premium that to the extent it is renewed, it will renew within the Nephila funds. Obviously, what that does for us in terms of Markle's balance sheet is it removes that volatility from Markle's balance sheet and as we go forward to the extent we want to take cat risk, it's a cleaner option, I think, to do it within the Nephila funds, to invest in the Nephila funds. It shows alignment with our investors, it's very easy to calculate how much capital I'm allocating to cat, whatever the investment is, makes that that math simple. And then obviously Nephila with its management of roughly 10 billion of AUM, they have market presence, market clout that we just were never going to be able to achieve at Markel Re. So, the logic just made too much sense in terms of making that move.\nMark Dwelle: Thanks for that and the logic did seem to make quite a bit of sense. On that same topic or generally in that same topic, with the legal settlement you've now achieved in cat code does that accelerate or change any of the timeline on finalizing the run off there?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: No, the run-off is really dictated by the settlement of the contracts with the cedes and the team there has made terrific progress settling the ceding. I think we're down to about 1.2 billion of AUM which I think is, I don't know, 1.2 billion or so down from the beginning of the year. So they've made great progress. As is always the case, you know, that last bit takes a while. So they're working really hard to do it but that settlement really is unrelated to how long it will take to return all assets to the investors.\nMark Dwelle: Okay, and then the other question that I had, you provided a very helpful table in the Q related to the various COVID related charges that you took. There are a few items within that table though, where it showed effectively a negative charge. Were those just reclassifications between the insurance and reinsurance segments or was there some actual release of reserves or takedown of reserves associated? \nJeremy A. Noble: Hey Mark, it is Jeremy. There were a few pockets actually where we reduced our reserves from initial expectation. Some of that we saw in our U.S. property relative to our initial sort of reserves. Also within our international book in the UK relative to business interruption, we kind of commented about the sort of the contrast between putting some reserves up in our reinsurance line associated with the FCA test case. But we really haven't seen the frequency of claims reporting for some of the business interruption relative to our initial expectations there. So there were a couple of situations where we reduced reserves netting against those increases.\nRichard R. Whitt, III: And Mark, I tried to kind of allude to that in my comments. I mean, obviously we took our best shot back in the first quarter coming up with reserves for COVID. Obviously, since then, we've learned a lot more and my guess is we'll continue to learn as we get through this because we've never seen this situation before. As a result of those learnings in some areas, we felt the reserves could come down. In other areas, we felt reserves needed to go up. And my guess is that that will probably continue as we go forward. We'll continue to adjust as we learn.\nMark Dwelle: Of the total bucket of sort of $375ish million, is most of that still in IB&R at this point or has there been significant pay downs relative to that for certainly some of the event claims, I would think I have paid at this point?\nThomas S. Gayner: Yeah, certainly Mark, I don't know if you're right there, but I think more than half of that is still in IB&R. So we've seen -- certainly we've seen increased claims reporting from the encourage standpoint and we've had some settlement activity, but there's still a significant amount of that that's sitting in IB&R. And it's a good example of the amounts that have been put up in the third quarter, that's principally all in IB&R. \nMark Dwelle: Understood. Thanks for all the answers. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Fox from Fenimore Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richie, I'm curious what your expectation is for State National. You mentioned some new programs coming out. When do you expect that would start growing again?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: You know, I think it will. Those were big programs that came off in the first quarter. And it's -- we talked enough about it. One of those programs was very much an opportunistic program. And when that company received their upgrade of their ratings, they no longer needed State Nationals program services running capabilities. So if you do that it is going to go away. The other one was a little surprising to us, not so much that it went away, but how it went away that on a cut off basis and that premium all just moving to the new carrier. But we've seen a number of new programs coming on. Unfortunately, none of those have been quite as large as the two that went away. But we'll start to see premium ramp up from those new programs and more importantly, we really like the activity we're seeing. And I think it's just, what's happening in the market it's a very interesting, exciting time in the market right now. There's a number of new players trying to get themselves set up to hopefully take advantage, I guess, of the conditions and running services is a very attractive way to get going quickly. So we're receiving a lot of inquiries.\nJohn Fox: Okay, great. And you mentioned probably not a quote, but you have not met your underwriting goals over the last few years due to the cat losses and that you're remixing the business. So I'm assuming you're aspiring to a higher underwriting profit, can you share like what you were thinking about in terms of when you're mixing the business and what type of combined ratio, or is it premature for that?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: You know, John, given the rate increases we are seeing, given the interest rate environment that Tom and the team are having to contend with, we need to be around the 90 combined. And I'd love to see it lower. But I think it's got to be something around the 90 because we just can't put the pressure on Tom and team to generate returns in this low to no interest rate environment.\nJohn Fox: Right. Okay, great, thank you. And then I understand there was a settlement in the lawsuit, so maybe you can't talk about some of this, but to the extent that you can what is the run rate expenses of profitability at ILS investment management side?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Well, I'm going to -- it's not going to be an exact quote from Mr. Noble. Mr. Noble and I were talking the other day, and unfortunately, I don't think I've seen a run rate quarter yet. You know, there's just been a lot of noise, unfortunately. But here's where we are, John, I think we have had success in attracting new AUM for January 1. So that will be coming on board for 2021. So the two things that impact our ability to make -- to create a return in ILS are the amount of AUM and how many losses we have. Well, we can't do much about the number of losses, although I would tell you the last four years have been brutal. But rates are going up substantially, so I think that business is going to be better priced. I know that business is better priced going forward, giving us a better opportunity to earn on that for our investors and thus earn fees. So, there really, really hasn't been a good run rate quarter yet. But I think going into 2021 we've got some momentum, both in terms of rate increases we're receiving and so the profitability of the business were riding and investors signing up to invest in the funds.\nThomas S. Gayner: And John, if I could tag on to Richard's answer, because there's one very, very important nuance that I think often gets lost in the communication of how this business works and its newness to Markel. So when Richard talked about the losses that occur in the old days, when we were writing that business on our balance sheet, that would be dollar for dollar our capital that would have a loss and would show up in the combined ratio, the business we write. This is where we're managing other people's capital. So the loss ratio really has a profound but indirect effect on the management and performance fees. So there's exponential returns on our capital when industry losses come in more at a lower level than would have been the last couple of years. And to Richie's point about we haven't seen a normal run rate, we've not been in an environment where you start to see kind of what your normalized expectation of management and performance fees that Nephila has indeed earned over many years and we would expect to normally describe the business. \nJohn Fox: Okay, well let me -- this prompts another question. So if I think about traditional asset management, whichever one the call is familiar with, you would take average value in terms of fee and if I do that, I get about 140 basis points on Nephila revenue annualized and that would be my revenue and then expense, profit margins and investment margin about 30% on average. So, but it sounds like there's a third dimension, which is the amount of loss, cat losses also?\nThomas S. Gayner: Well, here's the thing. So like traditional asset management, if you were talking about a company that manages mutual funds where performance fees have historically not been part of it, your math is exactly that. It's assets under management times the management fee minus the expenses doing shakalaka [ph]. There's your profitability. In the 2.0 version of investment managers and there's plenty of them out there that's only part of the equation. Then there's another variable of performance fees based on how well you did for your investors. And that's the aspect that I'm just highlighting here.\nJohn Fox: Yeah, okay, so it's three dimensions, not two.\nThomas S. Gayner: Correct. So John, obviously, given the last four years there hasn't been a lot of performance fees earned because there's been pretty above normal or above previous normal cat activity. So that's impacted it. And also, there is this business is highly leverageable. At 10 billion of assets under management, it would look very different under 12 billion or 13 billion or 14 billion of assets under management, because we really don't need to add a lot of additional cost to manage that. We can scale the business pretty substantially.\nJohn Fox: Right, okay, thank you. That's good clarification.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Stefano at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Stefano: Yeah, thanks for the follow-up. Richie on the 90% combined ratio goal that you had talked about, I assume that that's a reported number that includes cats and all the but for? \nRichard R. Whitt, III: Yes, it has to include cats and but for. Yeah, we need we need to get to that sort of level I think, given the interest rate environment.\nPhilip Stefano: And how do you think about the dynamics of pricing versus where you stand today and getting there over the next couple of years?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: You know, I feel very bullish about that. I think we talked with the first set of questions about the improvement in the underlying attritional. So, I think there's more room for that to improve. And we've obviously been working very hard to reduce volatility from cat losses. So, I'm bullish as we go into 2021.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay, and the last one is a numbers question on ventures, can you help us frame the contribution that Lansing could have over the next couple of quarters or what we could expect maybe there's some seasonality to the business as we think about the revenue growth into mid-2021?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Yeah, I think when you look at the quarter, given current business conditions, that's a reasonable run rate kind of revenue thoughts that you should have. Typically, seasonality building products tend to slow down a little bit in the wintertime. We're not seeing that right now. Just things housing related are white hot, but we'll see how it goes. And we've not owned it long enough to give you any seasonal pattern other than common sense would tell you that construction tends to be more warm weather than cold weather.\nPhilip Stefano: I didn't see a standalone Lansing number, is that something you have at your fingertips for the benefit in the quarter?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: No. \nPhilip Stefano: All right, thank you. \nRichard R. Whitt, III: Part of Markel Ventures, Nasdaq and the whole thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Gold from Truist [ph]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hello, gentlemen. I have a why not instead of a but for. [Technical Difficulty] facing horrific conditions whether they're fires or storms or COVID, and yet you have to maintain that equity of the company during this horrific period. Over my many decades in this business, I've seen many companies that had share repurchase plans not by when the price was low, but by when the price was high and I know you're very attuned to value when you make that decision, but the skies -- if the skies are not perfectly blue now, but it seems like you are envisioning times when they're going to get a lot bluer than they are currently. The pricing is good. Ventures is doing well. You feel good about all the insurance arms. Why not take the handcuffs off the statement that you're not open to buying shares back today, you've got cash, I believe, $4.5 billion I've never seen, if that's correct, I haven't seen that ratio to value of the company in your history. Why wait for the last cloud to clear, to have the ability to pull the trigger if you choose to do so, it doesn't mean you have to in the last quarter of the year but you would have told the market that you want to have that arrow back in your quiver and you may or may not use it? \nThomas S. Gayner: Right. Charles this is Tom, thanks for the question. And really the long 10 in the poll from my point of view, is the regulatory and rating agency environment that we continue to need to be sensitive to. So in the environment, which we continue to be in, the current growth rate of what we're experiencing our insurance business has regulators and rating agencies being very particular about the amount of capital we have and the form in which it is held. So we continue to work with them to try to make them as comfortable as we possibly can. And that's an ongoing process. And at the point where the growth rate slows down a little bit, that will actually free up sort of the regulatory capital and rating agency capital that we need to be sensitive to for the insurance business. But other than that, I agree with everything you say.\nUnidentified Analyst : Well, then the other signal would be insiders consider doing heavy buying since they see things going so well? \nThomas S. Gayner: From your mouth to God's ear.\nUnidentified Analyst : Oh, just give me the phone call I can do that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Bob Farnam at Boenning & Scattergood. Please go ahead. \nRobert Farnam: Yeah, hi there. Good morning. Just maybe one more question for Ritchie on the reinsurance segment. Obviously, if you included the cat losses I think I looked at last night, you had a cumulative loss over the last 10 years or so, I suppose. But for cat and ventures it is pretty sizable. It seems to me that by consolidating the property cat business through Nephila you are going to be reducing a lot of the volatility in that segment. So my question is more, if it's going to be looking more like casualty and specialty going forward, how has that performed and how far away from that 90% combined ratio are those pieces?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Yeah, it has not performed as well as it needed to, Bob, is what I tell you, and that I can't remember whose question it was. But I've said, before we're growing, we're going to make sure we've got it at the right price, at the right level of profitability. And, we're seeing really nice rate increases on the primary side. Not all of that has flowed through to reinsurance yet. So we're going to be watching that really closely. But I am bullish on our opportunity to get back to a great -- to a good profitability level. But I think it is -- I think reinsurance is a little behind primary at the moment. And so we're going to keep working on it and once we are comfortable, you'll see us grow it.\nRobert Farnam: Okay, so my point is, alright so reinsurance that we take 200 million of the property cat out, maybe take a lot of the catastrophe losses out so that is kind of a way to back into what the other pieces have obviously performed I think. Obviously the COVID, you probably consider that casualty and specialty or is that cat, how are you looking at it? \nRichard R. Whitt, III: That's mostly coming out of the property policy. Not entirely, but mostly.\nRobert Farnam: Okay, alright, good. So is that the right way to think about it and remove a lot of the cat exposure, the cat losses, taking the premium out, and maybe give you a run rate of the reinsurance sector going forward?\nRichard R. Whitt, III: Yes. And what I would tell you is if you do that math, that combined ratio has not been good enough and the market has been softening for probably going on 8 to 10 years. So we have an increasing rate for at least the last two years and I think it's on the right track, but it's not where primary is yet. And that's why we -- you haven't seen growth there yet. Growth is available. We don't want it until we're absolutely positive that the profitability is there. \nRobert Farnam: Alright, understood. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks. \nThomas S. Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for your long-term support. We look forward to connecting with you again next quarter. Thank you, be well. \nOperator: This conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "A - Jeremy A. Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Our underwriting, investing in Markel Ventures results continue to be heavily influenced by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But fortunately we saw positive contributions from each of our three engines during the third quarter. Our insurance operations produced an underwriting profit despite elevated levels of natural catastrophe losses, as well as increases to reserves related to the pandemic reflecting the strong underlying performance of our business. Our Markel Ventures operations delivered meaningful profits demonstrating their resilience despite economic uncertainty and our investment portfolio also saw gains in mid-volatile market conditions.  Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $5.4 billion for the first nine months of 2020, compared to $4.9 billion in 2019, an increase of 10%. This increase was attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $4.5 billion, an increase of 13% compared to the 2019 period. This premium growth is attributable to both our growth in our -- and more favorable rates within our professional liability and general liability product lines, as well as growth in our personal product lines. Gross written premiums within our reinsurance segment were consistent with the 2019 period at roughly $960 million. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2020, which is down 1 point from 84% in 2019, and our premiums for the first nine months increased 10% to 4.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment.  Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2020 was a 101 compared to a 95 in 2019. For the third quarter of 2020 we reported a 97 combined ratio compared to a 94 a year ago. Our 2020 combined ratio included nine points of underwriting losses attributed to COVID-19 for the nine-month period, compared to three points for the quarter. As I've discussed for the past two quarters, we recognized $325 million of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses during the first quarter of this year. For those policies and contracts were COVID-19 was identified as the proximate direct cause of loss. During the third quarter, we increased our loss estimates on these coverages by $32 million and also recognized $15 million of losses on our trade credit product line arising from the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic. As a reminder, our losses for COVID-19 are primarily attributed to business written within our international insurance operations and are primarily associated with coverages for event cancellations and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions surrounding COVID-19 which, among other things includes assumptions around coverages, liability, reinsurance, protection, duration, and loss mitigation factors, as well as the fact that the economic impacts of a pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates continue to be subject to a wide range of variability.  During the third quarter, a test case of a sample of business interruption coverages for policies written in the United Kingdom was completed with the court's judgment finding mostly in the favor of policyholders. This ruling was most impactful to certain estimates in our reinsurance segment, where we increased our estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses of certain treaties following increase in estimated losses by our [indiscernible]. Within our insurance segment, the ruling did not meaningfully impact the reserves previously established for business interruption coverage, given the assumptions we initially made in our policy terms and conditions. Our estimates at September 30, 2020 also reflect additional data gathered through increased claims reporting and change in our expected duration of the pandemic, which was most impactful to our event cancellation coverages.  In addition to the explicit provision of losses recognized during the quarter on a trade credit product line as the overall effects of the pandemic continue to evolve, further losses indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic are possible and may also emerge within our professional liability and worker's compensation product lines, among others including our reinsurance product lines. To date we've not seen any other evidence of significant incurred losses increasing for these secondary exposures. Our underwriting results for the first nine months of 2020 and 2019 also reflect losses attributable to natural catastrophes. Our 2020 combined ratio included $101 million or two points of underwriting losses from Hurricane Laura, Sally, Isaias, as well as the Midwest [indiscernible] and wildfires in the Western U.S. Compared to our 2019 combined ratio which included $43 million or one point of underwriting losses from Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our reserve and philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably $235 million in the first nine months of 2020 compared to favorable prior year development of $337 million in 2019.  Turning to our investment results, following the significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the first quarter, we have seen meaningful recoveries in the second and third quarters. Net investment losses for the first nine months of 2020 were $231 million, compared to net investment gains of $1.1 billion last year with year-over-year decline of 1.3 billion. As I have mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected and we may continue to see volatility in equity markets due in part to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic. With regards to net investment income we reported $274 million the first nine months of 2020 compared to $339 million a year ago. The decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates and lower holdings of fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $298 million net of taxes during 2020, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from declines in interest rates during the first nine months of the year.  Now to cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment, revenues from Markel Ventures surpassed $2 billion through the first nine months of 2020 compared to $1.6 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April, and the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Excluding the contributions of Lansing and VSC in 2020 operating revenues in our Markel Ventures operations decreased compared to 2019 as a result of decreased demand attributed to the economic and social disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $284 million for the first nine months of 2020 compared to $219 million last year, reflecting the contribution of Lansing and VSC, as well as growth and improved operating results in certain of our businesses.  Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2020 was not meaningful to the small pre-tax loss in the period. The effective tax rate was 22% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, and the estimated annual effective tax rate for both periods was 21%. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $31 million for the first nine months of 2020, compared to net income to shareholders of $1.3 billion a year ago. And when combined with the contribution of the increase in net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio, comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months of 2020 was $260 million compared to $1.6 billion a year ago.  Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2020 compared to $712 million in 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. Invested assets of our holding company was $3.8 billion at the end of September compared to $4 million at the end of 2019. A change in holding company invested assets reflects funds used to acquire Lansing, as well as a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, both of which were partially offset by proceeds from our May 2020 preferred shares offering. Total shareholders' equity stood at $11.9 billion at the end of September, compared to $11.1 billion at year end. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality investment grade securities with an average rating of AA, our debt to total capital ratio at the end of September was 23%, down slightly from 24% at year-end. We have no unsecured senior notes maturing until July 2022. We believe we are well positioned to meet our ongoing capital liquidity needs, including supporting the growth in our insurance operations as we expect to continue to see attractive opportunities in the specialty insurance marketplace. With that I will turn it over to Richie, to talk more about our insurance businesses."

            "content": "Thank you Emily. Good morning and welcome. We apologize for the delay in starting the call this morning. We understand that one of the numbers that was distributed was incorrect and connected you to the replay which of course has not happened yet. This is the actual call. We have sent out an email with the correct number and we see a roster has been assembled and something of a slowed fashion. We apologize for that error on our part. We hope others are able to join us in process and that the replay will work as functioned and we are grateful that you are here this morning.  So, good morning and welcome. As is stated this is Tom Gayner, I am here today with our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. We are glad you have joined us and we look forward to briefing you on current conditions as well as answering your questions. I'm not telling you anything you don't know when I say that 2020 remains unlike any other year. The systemic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and all that follow in its wake remain immense and unrelenting. That said, I could not be more proud of the efforts of everyone in this organization to truly serve our customers, our associates, and our shareholders in the face of adversity. We've provided for claims and financial assistance to our policyholder customers to cover substantial losses and economic costs. Those losses stem not just from the things you see in the headlines regarding the pandemic, but also a spate of natural catastrophes such as more hurricanes than hurricane memes, wildfires, a major derecho, and ongoing and recurring events and circumstances that we see regularly in our insurance operations.  We continue to provide necessary and desirable products and services throughout our Markel ventures operations. That includes building the machines that bake bread, things don't get much more basic or necessary than that and since man does not live by bread alone, we also produce and provide everything from medical services, housing, houseplants to brighten your day, and trailers to convey everything from industrial gases to the car you drive. We make truck floors to keep the products you need from falling out of the bottom of the trailer, technology consulting services to manage and keep track of it all, and many other items as well. And by the way, we also provide fire suppression services to keep it all from catching on fire. We're doing our best to keep our associates safe and gainfully employed throughout these trying times. We're also working to produce financial results which create the capital we need to be able to serve our customers and associates.  Over many years and as displaced to the first nine months of 2020 we've built a system at Markel to be a resilient and robust company. We work to serve and dependably honor the promises we make. We've built a diversified three engine machine consisting of our insurance, investment, and Markel Ventures operations. Those components work together to fulfill our purpose each and every day. We're delighted to be able to report our 2020 year-to-date progress in doing so this morning. Clearly, work remains to be done while our insurance operations remain mildly in the red to the year-to-date, we've recovered dramatically since the first quarter shock losses we recognized at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've accelerated our pace of making tough but necessary decisions to increase the durability and quality of our insurance operations, which will be measured by improved profitability and our investment operations for reporting profitable results for the first nine months. While that is always too short a time frame to draw conclusions about investing, those results continue a multi-year pattern of conservative and profitable investing. Our investments protect our balance sheet and stand behind the promises we make and they also produce appropriate returns.  At our ventures operations we produced outstanding results so far in 2020. The leaders of the ventures businesses adapted and figured out ways to surmount unprecedented conditions and circumstances. I am grateful and amazed for their work and accomplishments. The performance of our three engines demonstrates the resilience and the spirit of Markel to fulfill our purpose of serving our customers, our associates, and our shareholders. We believe in a win, win, win as the fundamental architecture underlying Markel, and we're pleased to be able to share how that played out in the unprecedented conditions of 2020 today. Even more importantly, we hope this update provides you with a shared optimism of how we will continue to evolve and build even more resilience and sustainability going forward. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to review the financial details of the year-to-date. Richard will then follow with some commentary on our insurance and insurance linked securities operations and then I will speak briefly about our ventures and investment engines. Following that, we will take the questions. With that Jeremy. Thank you, Richard. In our investing operations we earned 0.8% on our equity portfolio and 5.4% on our fixed income holdings for a total return of 3.8% after all allocated expenses and FX effects. I am pleased with positive returns in the current environment. Strategically, I believe that the most important role for investments at this point is to preserve and protect the balance sheet of Markel. Given our views about the general level of trade-offs between risk and return on offer today, we believe that our current focus on high quality and liquidity preserve options to make different investment decisions in a different environment. The opportunity cost of our stance seems very low to me. We don't think that we would get paid appropriately for taking meaningful credit, duration, or many other types of risk right now. As such will stay relatively liquid and ready and able to deploy cash more aggressively when we see the opportunity to earn appropriate returns and compensation for doing so.  In our ventures operations I want to be clear, the news is excellent. The managers and teams of the ventures businesses continue to respond superbly to rapidly changing and disrupted business conditions. I am grateful and amazed at their skills, professionalism and dedication to their associates and their customers. For the first nine months, revenues of ventures grew 28% to just over 2 billion, compared to 1.56 billion a year ago. EBITDA for the nine months increased 29% to 284 million, compared to 219 million a year ago. This record setting financial performance was broad based. While this is the first full quarter of results from our most recent acquisition of Lansing Building Products, the entire group demonstrated resiliency and the value of diversification.  We operate an array of different industrial and service businesses that are market leaders in what they do. They serve a wide variety of customers and experience economic cyclicality and variability from many factors. We would normally expect volatility from their results, not unlike what we experience from our investment portfolio when we look at short-term timeframes. That said I think this year's results stand as a dramatic validation of the value of Markel Ventures to the overall purpose and future of the Markel Corporation. For your reference, I checked my notes from the third quarter year-to-date conference call from five years ago in 2015, and that year we reported revenues from Markel Ventures of 784 million for the first nine months and EBITDA of 76 billion. I don't remember the exact economic circumstances and conditions of 2015, but I'm pretty sure it didn't include dealing with a worldwide pandemic. Our efforts to build an enduring and resilient system at Markel continue to unfold. I'm hopeful that the evidence we've offered you this morning about our short-term and long-term progress provides you with some confidence in our win, win, win mindset as we seek to build one of the world's great companies. With that, Emily, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor, we'd love to answer some of your questions. Thanks, Jeff. This is Tom. I would say there's a lot of M&A being done, but not at prices that we're going to do it. Frankly, over the last three or four years, we've not made a lot of outgoing calls or solicited things, but some businesses have been attracted to the long term nature of Markel so, we have grown almost in spite of ourselves. We observe a lot of transactions and we're rubbing hair off our head, scratching our head, looking at the valuation. So I think the circumstances you lay out will probably happen someday but we're kind of watching the parade go by. No, yeah, I want to reiterate that that profitability is across the board. So, yeah, everybody's feeling COVID in one way or another but again, I just take my hats off to the managers and people at the Markel Ventures operations. They've done a -- just grateful and amazed are the two words that accurately describe the circumstance. So that's not concentrated in any one place. Obviously, the revenue pick-up is pretty big for Lansing because that is a business where I mean, it's distribution kind of business. So revenues are disproportionately high compared to EBITDA relative to the rest of the Markel Venture set of businesses. The returns on capital would be similar, but it's across the board. The group is doing very well. And that's a good example where I think we will find the opportunity to kind of make up for that premium reduction by focusing on the profitable classes that we're seeing opportunities. Yeah, certainly Mark, I don't know if you're right there, but I think more than half of that is still in IB&R. So we've seen -- certainly we've seen increased claims reporting from the encourage standpoint and we've had some settlement activity, but there's still a significant amount of that that's sitting in IB&R. And it's a good example of the amounts that have been put up in the third quarter, that's principally all in IB&R. And John, if I could tag on to Richard's answer, because there's one very, very important nuance that I think often gets lost in the communication of how this business works and its newness to Markel. So when Richard talked about the losses that occur in the old days, when we were writing that business on our balance sheet, that would be dollar for dollar our capital that would have a loss and would show up in the combined ratio, the business we write. This is where we're managing other people's capital. So the loss ratio really has a profound but indirect effect on the management and performance fees. So there's exponential returns on our capital when industry losses come in more at a lower level than would have been the last couple of years. And to Richie's point about we haven't seen a normal run rate, we've not been in an environment where you start to see kind of what your normalized expectation of management and performance fees that Nephila has indeed earned over many years and we would expect to normally describe the business. Well, here's the thing. So like traditional asset management, if you were talking about a company that manages mutual funds where performance fees have historically not been part of it, your math is exactly that. It's assets under management times the management fee minus the expenses doing shakalaka [ph]. There's your profitability. In the 2.0 version of investment managers and there's plenty of them out there that's only part of the equation. Then there's another variable of performance fees based on how well you did for your investors. And that's the aspect that I'm just highlighting here. Correct. So John, obviously, given the last four years there hasn't been a lot of performance fees earned because there's been pretty above normal or above previous normal cat activity. So that's impacted it. And also, there is this business is highly leverageable. At 10 billion of assets under management, it would look very different under 12 billion or 13 billion or 14 billion of assets under management, because we really don't need to add a lot of additional cost to manage that. We can scale the business pretty substantially. Right. Charles this is Tom, thanks for the question. And really the long 10 in the poll from my point of view, is the regulatory and rating agency environment that we continue to need to be sensitive to. So in the environment, which we continue to be in, the current growth rate of what we're experiencing our insurance business has regulators and rating agencies being very particular about the amount of capital we have and the form in which it is held. So we continue to work with them to try to make them as comfortable as we possibly can. And that's an ongoing process. And at the point where the growth rate slows down a little bit, that will actually free up sort of the regulatory capital and rating agency capital that we need to be sensitive to for the insurance business. But other than that, I agree with everything you say. From your mouth to God's ear. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for your long-term support. We look forward to connecting with you again next quarter. Thank you, be well."

            "name": "Jeremy A. Noble",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, Bill. Yeah, third quarter there were a lot of different things impacting the third quarter, but one in particular was I mean, we are taking the opportunity to remix and really focus on growing what we call our green classes, the most profitable classes. So we've become -- we've been very aggressive I think this year in terms of moving away from business that wasn't meeting our profitability goals, closing some of those down, closing down programs that we didn't see meeting our goals. And some of that's starting to add up and that impacted the third quarter. Also in the third quarter, July 1 is a big date for us and we had a really good July 1. August, September, they tend to be less busy months for us and that sort of continued this year. So all in all, I'm very pleased with the growth we showed in the third quarter, given all the moving parts and all the things we are doing. Also, it's fair to say, the economic struggles have impacted, I think, small business to a greater extent than maybe larger businesses. And we saw the massive amount of stimulus that was put into the economy in the first six months, that wasn't there in the third quarter. And I think some of that had been used to pay premiums in the first two quarters by some businesses. So we saw a little bit of that in the third quarter, but I'm not particularly concerned about it. We've seen a few of our numbers so far for October and I would tell you, they're very strong. So, you say why wouldn't we grow double-digits in 2021, that's certainly going to be our goal to grow double-digits in 2021. Not so much to gross yet. I mean, I think for a period of time so that program transitions we're sort of serving in the front end capacity. So it influences the net retention versus what we've seen so far on the gross written premium. Sure, sure, Mark. It's effective 4011 [ph] so no 11 business will be renewed on Markle's books. And if those clients are interested, Nephila will offer renewal quotes on that business. It's about 200 million of premium. It's obviously cat driven premium that to the extent it is renewed, it will renew within the Nephila funds. Obviously, what that does for us in terms of Markle's balance sheet is it removes that volatility from Markle's balance sheet and as we go forward to the extent we want to take cat risk, it's a cleaner option, I think, to do it within the Nephila funds, to invest in the Nephila funds. It shows alignment with our investors, it's very easy to calculate how much capital I'm allocating to cat, whatever the investment is, makes that that math simple. And then obviously Nephila with its management of roughly 10 billion of AUM, they have market presence, market clout that we just were never going to be able to achieve at Markel Re. So, the logic just made too much sense in terms of making that move. Hey Mark, it is Jeremy. There were a few pockets actually where we reduced our reserves from initial expectation. Some of that we saw in our U.S. property relative to our initial sort of reserves. Also within our international book in the UK relative to business interruption, we kind of commented about the sort of the contrast between putting some reserves up in our reinsurance line associated with the FCA test case. But we really haven't seen the frequency of claims reporting for some of the business interruption relative to our initial expectations there. So there were a couple of situations where we reduced reserves netting against those increases."

            "name": "Richard R. Whitt, III",
            "content": "Thanks Jeremy and good morning everyone. As Tom's already said, the year has -- and we saw the continuation of the unpredictable rollercoaster year that is 2020 in the third quarter. Despite all that our insurance operations continued to grow nicely and we obtained meaningful rate increases in almost all our lines. Our third quarter was also impacted by a series of small and medium sized cats as Jeremy mentioned, for which we recorded an aggregate 101 million of underwriting losses in the quarter and those were related to multiple hurricanes Laura, Sally, Isaias, the derecho, and the Western wildfires. As regards COVID-19 losses in the third quarter of 2020 we increased that provision to 374 million, that was up from our original 325 million provision that we established in the first quarter. While we have revised many of our original assumptions with the availability of additional information and some of those have been positive, some of those have been negative, the largest driver for the increase in our direct estimates this quarter related to the UK High Court ruling on the FCA business interruption test case that the impact of that ruling impacted our estimates within our reinsurance segment.  There were also some increases required, as we now expect the impact of COVID-19 to be felt into the first half of 2021 that specifically impacts event cancellation business. As part of the third quarter 2000 -- of COVID-19 provision we also recorded 15 million of estimated losses in our trade credit product line within our insurance operations, and those claims were related to indirect economic impact from COVID-19. We're not a but for company at Markel. Cat losses over the past four years, including 2020 COVID-19 losses have significantly impacted all of our insurance, reinsurance, and ILS businesses. As a consequence, we've missed our underwriting profitability goals over that four-year period and as a result we've implemented many key strategic changes over the last several quarters designed to reduce the number of but for items that could potentially impact our future results.  We believe the changes we have made and will continue to make will reduce the volatility of our insurance business results going forward. Given the strength of the current market and pricing trends and the unique capabilities we have assembled, we're bullish about our opportunity to perform and put more points on the board moving forward. Make no mistake, we're realists and this is insurance and but for events are going to happen. Our goal is to lessen their impact and deliver stronger underwriting results to account for the inevitable events that will occur.  Now, I'd like to discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations, and insurance linked securities operations. So I'll kick off with the insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the quarter were up 96 million or 7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. For the nine months, premiums were up 503 million or 13%. Premium growth for both the quarter and nine months was driven by continued organic growth and rate increases in our professional liability and general liability products, along with growth in our personal line product lines. For the quarter ended September 30th, these increases were partially offset by lower gross written premiums within certain of our specialty programs due to lower economic activity related to COVID-19 and due to active portfolio management, where we have discontinued writing certain underperforming lines and programs.  We're taking the opportunity in this market to remix our portfolio to our most profitable lines of business. The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 94 for the third quarter of 2020, compared to 92 last year. That two point increase in the combined ratio was driven by a five point increase in the impact of cat losses and one point of losses attributed to COVID-19 exposures, partially offset by lower attritional loss ratio and a lower expense ratio. The decrease in the attritional loss ratio due to decreases in our general liability and property product lines driven again by premium rate increases.  The insurance segment combined ratio for the first nine months was 100% versus 94% for the same period a year ago. The six point increase in the combined ratio was driven primarily by nine points of loss attributed to COVID-19 exposures and two point increase from the impact of cat losses. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in favorable development on prior accident years losses primarily in our professional liability and product -- property product lines, and a lower attritional loss ratio across several product lines due in part to premium rate increases and lower expense ratio. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and year-to-date within our insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior year's loss ratio.  Moving to the reinsurance segment, a few weeks ago we announced that we are creating one center of expertise for the global property cat reinsurance market by closing our Markel global property cat unit and having Nephila become Markel's single point of entry for serving the property cat reinsurance market. This move allows us to more fully leverage Nephila's market leading competitive position while also generating operational efficiencies. We believe that the companies that will win in the future are those who most efficiently connect risk with capital, and this strategic move is going to help us do that in the property cat market. Going forward Markel global REIT will increase its focus on underwriting and growing its casualty in specialty lines under the continued leadership of Jed Rhoads, President and Chief Underwriting Officer.  Gross written premiums for both the quarter and year decreased slightly compared to the same periods in 2019. In the quarter we saw higher gross premiums in our general liability lines due primarily to new business written and higher rates on that business, offset by lower premiums in our worker's compensation and property lines due to lower premium adjustments and lower renewal premiums within workers compensation. And the unfavorable impact of renewal timing within property. As mentioned previously, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant deals and the timing of renewals. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 116 for the third quarter compared to 103 last year. That 13 point increase in the combined ratio was driven by three point increase from the impact of cat losses and a 15 point increase due to losses attributed to COVID-19, partially offset by more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves. The increase in favorable prior year loss development was due to favorable development in our professional liability and worker's compensation product lines this year versus adverse development that was experienced last year.  The reinsurance segment combined ratio for the first nine months was 106 versus 99 for the same period a year ago. A seven point increase in the combined ratio was driven by one point increase from the impact of cat losses and a 10 point increase due to losses attributed to COVID-19. This was partially offset by a lower expense ratio and more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves. The increase in favorable prior year loss development is due to more favorable development in our property product line partially offset by adverse development on our public entity product line in 2020.  Next, I'm going to touch on program services and our ILS operations. As a reminder amounts from our program services in ILS operations are reported within services and other revenues expenses within our operating results. So starting with State National, gross written premium volume for State National's program service operations were down in both the quarter and year-to-date basis that was driven by the runoff of one large program and the end in force cancellation of another large program, which resulted in a onetime unfavorable premium adjustment in the first quarter of this year. While gross written premium is down as a result of these two programs, we've seen encouraging new business activity and we have found a number of new programs that are coming online as we move forward. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium in our program services division is ceded. Ceding fee revenues were also down for both the quarter and the year due to the lower gross written premium volume over the past few quarters.  Moving to our insurance linked securities operations, our combined ILS operations have roughly 10.6 billion in net assets under management and as of September 30th. Revenues from our ILS operations decreased 29% from the prior year's quarter and 8% for the nine-month period. Both the quarter and year-to-date periods were impacted by lower management fees at CATCo due to lower AUM from winding down the operations and reduction in management fees charged during the wind down. Nephila revenues were down for the quarter due to lower investment management fees as a result of some redemptions in 2020 and an increase in side pocket assets on which management fees are deferred until released. Obviously, the cats that occurred in the third quarter, we had to set up loss reserves for those as well as side pockets, and that impacted management fee income. For the year Nephila revenues are up with the decrease of Nephila investment management fees more than offset by higher revenues from their NGA operations. Operating expenses from our ILS operations increased for both the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year due to the impact of the legal settlement in the CATCo operations. Higher operating expenses associated with the growth in our Nephila NGA operations and startup costs associated with our large line operation.  I'll finish with a little bit of market commentary and obviously happy to pick that up when we get to questions. The trends that we've been discussing in the previous quarters continued in the third quarter. We see continued price momentum in almost all lines and we believe that this pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, elevated cat activity, social inflation, COVID-19 losses, and economic uncertainty as a result are all likely to persist throughout 2021. We also believe our businesses will benefit as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. While large and medium sized businesses have shown resiliency to the economic disruption, small businesses which are a meaningful part of our portfolio, have definitely been adversely impacted.  To sum it up, after a brutal start to the year with COVID-19 losses, we now have an opportunity to finish 2020 with an underwriting profit. We're going to need to push hard over these last nine weeks to achieve that goal. I want to thank all of our marketing employees who've worked so hard under difficult conditions to give us this opportunity. I want to thank you for your time today and now I'd like to turn it over to Tom. I'll do the best I can. We've gotten to a point where our year-to-date rate increases are double digit, low double digits at this point. So, rate is certainly a part of it. The remixing is also a part of it. We are growing the most in the lines of business that we again call our green classes, which are our most profitable classes. We are shrinking classes and you saw that some in the third quarter that we haven't seen the profitability that we would like to see. So, all those things are at play. And yes, we saw a very nice decrease in the attritional loss ratio so far in the year. And the goal is to make sure but for events, don't stop that from being, you know, what the result looks like as we go into 2021. So, unfortunately for the last four years, there's been a lot of cat events that have prevented what has been some pretty nice underlying performance, has prevented that from showing up in our combined ratio. And so, we've been taking a lot of steps to mitigate and hopefully reduce the number of those but for events. Well, obviously now Markel's global reach is going to be focused on casualty and specialty lines, and we do think there is an opportunity in the casualty and specialty lines to grow. We're seeing rate increases. I talked about we're seeing increases in our general liability reinsurance programs. And some of that or some of that is obviously new business. We're riding, but some of that increase is also just underlying rate increases in the primary business. We're going to be cautious then. We haven't seen the profitability we have wanted to see in those two areas over the last couple of years. So first and foremost is making sure it's profitable and once we're convinced it's profitable, we'll look to grow it in this environment. Well, we put a handful of programs and lines of business into runoff that were not performing. The particular one that I think that was mentioned there was being referred to was a program. It was a program for municipals and it had a heavy property exposure in it that had really not performed well. And so we chose to walk away from that. I think the impact in the quarter was $20 million, $30 million if I am not mistaken. Yeah, Jeremy's right. We're still fronting that for the next carrier at this moment. So it hasn't impacted our growth that much at this point, but we're not retaining it net. So over time that will come through as well. No, the run-off is really dictated by the settlement of the contracts with the cedes and the team there has made terrific progress settling the ceding. I think we're down to about 1.2 billion of AUM which I think is, I don't know, 1.2 billion or so down from the beginning of the year. So they've made great progress. As is always the case, you know, that last bit takes a while. So they're working really hard to do it but that settlement really is unrelated to how long it will take to return all assets to the investors. And Mark, I tried to kind of allude to that in my comments. I mean, obviously we took our best shot back in the first quarter coming up with reserves for COVID. Obviously, since then, we've learned a lot more and my guess is we'll continue to learn as we get through this because we've never seen this situation before. As a result of those learnings in some areas, we felt the reserves could come down. In other areas, we felt reserves needed to go up. And my guess is that that will probably continue as we go forward. We'll continue to adjust as we learn. You know, I think it will. Those were big programs that came off in the first quarter. And it's -- we talked enough about it. One of those programs was very much an opportunistic program. And when that company received their upgrade of their ratings, they no longer needed State Nationals program services running capabilities. So if you do that it is going to go away. The other one was a little surprising to us, not so much that it went away, but how it went away that on a cut off basis and that premium all just moving to the new carrier. But we've seen a number of new programs coming on. Unfortunately, none of those have been quite as large as the two that went away. But we'll start to see premium ramp up from those new programs and more importantly, we really like the activity we're seeing. And I think it's just, what's happening in the market it's a very interesting, exciting time in the market right now. There's a number of new players trying to get themselves set up to hopefully take advantage, I guess, of the conditions and running services is a very attractive way to get going quickly. So we're receiving a lot of inquiries. You know, John, given the rate increases we are seeing, given the interest rate environment that Tom and the team are having to contend with, we need to be around the 90 combined. And I'd love to see it lower. But I think it's got to be something around the 90 because we just can't put the pressure on Tom and team to generate returns in this low to no interest rate environment. Well, I'm going to -- it's not going to be an exact quote from Mr. Noble. Mr. Noble and I were talking the other day, and unfortunately, I don't think I've seen a run rate quarter yet. You know, there's just been a lot of noise, unfortunately. But here's where we are, John, I think we have had success in attracting new AUM for January 1. So that will be coming on board for 2021. So the two things that impact our ability to make -- to create a return in ILS are the amount of AUM and how many losses we have. Well, we can't do much about the number of losses, although I would tell you the last four years have been brutal. But rates are going up substantially, so I think that business is going to be better priced. I know that business is better priced going forward, giving us a better opportunity to earn on that for our investors and thus earn fees. So, there really, really hasn't been a good run rate quarter yet. But I think going into 2021 we've got some momentum, both in terms of rate increases we're receiving and so the profitability of the business were riding and investors signing up to invest in the funds. Yes, it has to include cats and but for. Yeah, we need we need to get to that sort of level I think, given the interest rate environment. You know, I feel very bullish about that. I think we talked with the first set of questions about the improvement in the underlying attritional. So, I think there's more room for that to improve. And we've obviously been working very hard to reduce volatility from cat losses. So, I'm bullish as we go into 2021. Yeah, I think when you look at the quarter, given current business conditions, that's a reasonable run rate kind of revenue thoughts that you should have. Typically, seasonality building products tend to slow down a little bit in the wintertime. We're not seeing that right now. Just things housing related are white hot, but we'll see how it goes. And we've not owned it long enough to give you any seasonal pattern other than common sense would tell you that construction tends to be more warm weather than cold weather. No. Part of Markel Ventures, Nasdaq and the whole thing. Yeah, it has not performed as well as it needed to, Bob, is what I tell you, and that I can't remember whose question it was. But I've said, before we're growing, we're going to make sure we've got it at the right price, at the right level of profitability. And, we're seeing really nice rate increases on the primary side. Not all of that has flowed through to reinsurance yet. So we're going to be watching that really closely. But I am bullish on our opportunity to get back to a great -- to a good profitability level. But I think it is -- I think reinsurance is a little behind primary at the moment. And so we're going to keep working on it and once we are comfortable, you'll see us grow it. That's mostly coming out of the property policy. Not entirely, but mostly. Yes. And what I would tell you is if you do that math, that combined ratio has not been good enough and the market has been softening for probably going on 8 to 10 years. So we have an increasing rate for at least the last two years and I think it's on the right track, but it's not where primary is yet. And that's why we -- you haven't seen growth there yet. Growth is available. We don't want it until we're absolutely positive that the profitability is there."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nThomas Gayner: Thanks so much. Good morning, and welcome to the Markel Corporation second quarter conference call. This is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined today as usual by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; as well as our CFO, Jeremy Noble. That maybe the last time we get to use the world, usual, in this call. It doesn't seem to be much that would fall into the camp of usual these days. In fact I've commented for the last several months that there is an unprecedented use of the word unprecedented. So far in 2020, unprecedented strikes me as the right word to use. I look forward to the day it becomes an overused clich\u00e9, but I don't think were there yet. Despite the unprecedented conditions that we and everyone else face, we've got good news to report to you this morning. Across Markel, in every business and for every customer, our people exhibited unusual and spectacular adaptability and dedication to serve our customers and each other. Our second quarter results, meaningful growth and profitability in each of the three engines of insurance, investments and ventures, reflect their efforts. All of the associates of Markel worked unbelievably hard and with great dedication and creativity to find a way forward. Speaking for Richie and Jeremy I want to extend our thanks to our dedicated associates in the way in which the people of Markel have adapted and persisted to serve our customers in this unprecedented conditions triggered by the Coronavirus. Now while much of today's call will focus on financial measurements and the effects of COVID-19 I want to take a moment to also address another virus we're facing as a society, namely the virus of racism. Let me be clear, we explicitly reject racism and discrimination. We are fully committed to the dignity and worth of each and every individual. During the last few months, Richie and I had the opportunity to listen to many of our associates and hear their voices and stories in new ways. We are listening and learning. I think the difficult conversations are having a very positive effect. We're confronting issues and problems that we haven\u2019t faced before in such a head-on way. The honesty and openness is refreshing and I think it gives us all a chance to learn in a new way and to make real progress. We mean the word to the Markel style. Those words include fairness in all our dealings and providing an atmosphere which people can reach their personal potential. We cite those core beliefs because they are crucial components behind another statement in the style, namely the question, find a better way to do this. Count on our consistent commitment to these ideas. At this point, I am going to turn to the financial reports in the second quarter. Jeremy, will provide you with an update on the numbers and then Richie will update you on our insurance and insurance-linked securities operations. I will then follow with comments on our investments and ventures operations. After that, we look forward to answering your questions. Jeremy.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom good morning, everyone. Our underwriting and testing in Markel ventures results for the first half of 2020 were meaningfully impacted by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, but encouragingly, we saw positive contributions from each of our three engines during the second quarter. While COVID-19 has and likely will continue to influence both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet, our financial condition was strong at the end of the second quarter. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that are being presented in the specialty insurance marketplace. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $3.7 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $3.3 million in 2019, an increase of 12%. This increase was due almost entirely to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $3 billion an increase of 16% compared to 2019. This growth related primarily to increased writings within our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy and personal lines product lines. Gross written premium within our reinsurance segment were as consistent in 2019 at roughly $740 million. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums held at 84% in both 2020 and 2019. Earned premiums increased 12% to $2.7 million in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2020 was a 103% compared to a 95% in 2019. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported an 88% combined ratio to 95% for the year ago. As we discussed a quarter ago, we recognized $325 million of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses during the first quarter for those policies and contrast for COVID-19 was identified as a proximate cause of loss. There were no changes in our loss estimates during the second quarter. These COVID-19 losses increased our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2020 at 12 points. Our initial estimates of losses directly attributable to COVID-19 and the end of March reflected limited claims reporting. However, after considering the additional data gathered through increased claims reporting activity in the second quarter and while continuing to monitor actual levels of disruption caused by the pandemic, there were no significant changes in our assumptions during the second quarter. As a reminder, our losses from COVID-19 are primarily attributed to business written within our international insurance operations, and primarily associated with coverages for event cancellation and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions surrounding COVID-19, which among other things include assumptions related to coverages, liability, reinsurance protection, duration and loss mitigation factors as well as the fact that the economic impacts of the pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates may be subject to a wide range of variability. As the overall pandemic continue to evolve, we expect losses indirectly related to COVID-19 pandemic and associated with a broader range of coverages are likely to emerge within our professional liability, trade credit and Workers Compensation product lines among others, including our reinsurance product lines. To date we've not seen significant evidence of incurred losses increasing for these secondary exposures and no explicit provision was made for indirect COVID-19 losses in the second quarter. It is worth noting that any increase in exposure associated with indirectly COVID-19 losses will lead to partially offset of an improving pricing environment. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our reserving philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $268 million in the first half of 2020 compared to a favorable prior year development of $189 million in 2019. Turning to our investment results, as I mentioned in prior calls given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, we continue to see volatility in the equity markets in the second quarter related to the economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the first quarter, we saw meaningful recoveries in the second quarter and investment losses for the first half of 2020 were $770 million compared to net investment gains of $1 million last year, a year-over-year decline of $1.8 million. With regards to net investment income, we reported $184 million in the first 2020 compared to $226 million in the first half of 2019. This decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates, lower holding from fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $237 million net of taxes during 2020 reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from declines in interest rates during the first half of the year. Now I'll cover the results of the Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $1.2 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $1.1 billion last year. Higher revenues from our services businesses were partially offset by lower revenues within our products businesses. Revenues within our services businesses reflect the contribution of revenues from our acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April and acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Within our products businesses, the economic and social disruption caused by COVID-19 resulted in decreased demand in many of our businesses during the second quarter. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $173 million for the first half of 2020 compared to $160 million last year, reflecting the contributions of Lansing and VSC, partially offset the impact of lower operating revenues in certain of our business. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was at 21% for the first half of 2020 compared to 22% in 2019. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $484 million for the first half of 2020 compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.1 billion a year , driven by the net loss, comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first half 2020 was $260 million compared to comprehensive income of $1.4 million in 2019. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $489 million for the first half of 2020 compared to $249 million for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected the effects of lower claims settlement activity in both our insurance and reinsurance segments and higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. Invested assets at the holding company were $3.7 million at June 30 compared to $4 billion at the end of 2019. The decrease in holding company invested assets was due to funds used to acquire Lansing as well as the decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio again related to the impacts of COVID-19, all of which was partially offset by the proceeds from our preferred shares offering. We recognize the importance of liquidity and a strong balance sheet in times of uncertainty and we intend to ensure Markel as resilient for the long-term. In addition to the success, we began taking in early March to maintain our ongoing capital and liquidity needs to manage against volatility, in May 2020, we issued $600 million of 6% fixed rate reset noncumulative Series A preferred shares with no par value and the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for an aggregate net proceeds after expenses of $592 million. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality and investment grade securities with an average rating of AA, a debt to total capital ratio at the end of June was 24% unchanged from the end of 2019 and we have no unsecured senior debt maturing until July 2022. We believe we're well positioned to meet the ongoing capital liquidity needs including supporting growth in our insurance operations should we continue to see attractive opportunities in the specialty marketplace. Total shareholder's equity stood at $11.4 million as of the end of June compared to $11.1 million at year-end. Much of that a quarter ago, the unprecedented events surrounding COVID-19 certainly impacted our year-to-date results. However, the actions we've taken over the years to building diverse organization will help us navigate through the current uncertainty arising from this pandemic and we're well positioned to continue our efforts to build one of the world trade companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance business.\nRichard Whitt: Thanks Jeremy and good morning, everyone. The first half of 2020 has been more eventful and volatile than most full years. We have a fantastic plan in building momentum as we entered 2020. We were executing well until COVID-19 hit with its unprecedented cap-like fury on a global scale impacting every industry, geography and community. Thanks to our dedicated employees, we took that first quarter hit, we quickly adapted and we staged a furious comeback in the second quarter. While we recognize there are still significant uncertainties, the 2020 underwriting year is far from loss. We believe to a person that we can make up significant ground over the next six months. This will require staying focused on what we can control and preparing as best possible for those things not in our control. As Jeremy mentioned related to the COVID the direct COVID-19 loss reserves, we did not adjust our original $325 million provision for direct COVID-19 losses in the second quarter. This is largely due to the fact that we've not seen evidence either positive or negative that would require us to change our estimate. Claims are materializing largely as we estimated and are being reserved and settled in line with our original assumptions. Despite the fact that we made no changes to our original estimate, the ongoing nature and uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic means the range of potential outcomes is wider than any catastrophe we've ever seen. Now I'll discuss our insurance businesses, which include our underwriting operations, our state national program services operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. Since starting with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter were up $185 million or 14% compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the first six months, premiums were up $407 million or 16%. Premium growth for both the quarter and first six months was driven by continued organic new business growth and rate increases in our professional liability and general liability products along with growth this quarter in our marine and energy products. The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 88% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to 95% last year. The seven point improvement in the combined ratio was driven by more favorable development on prior accident year's loss reserves, a lower expense ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio. This is a rare insurance trifecta. The increase in favorable development on prior accident year's losses was primarily driven by our property and general liability lines. The combined ratio of the first six months for the insurance segment was $103 million versus 95% for the same period a year ago. The eight point increase in the combined ratio was driven primarily by $293 million or 13 points of losses attributed to direct COVID-19 exposures recorded in the first quarter. The impact from COVID losses was partially offset by an increase in favorable development on prior accident year losses, primarily in our professional liability and property product lines. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and six-month within our insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior year's loss ratio. Turning to our reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for both the quarter and the year are flat compared to the same periods in 2019. In this quarter, we saw higher gross written premiums in our professional liability line due to favorable timing differences and favorable premium adjustments offset by lower premiums in our product line -- at our property line and that is aligned with their strategy to reduce natural catastrophe volatility. For the year, we saw higher gross premiums in Worker's Compensation driven by a large relationship offset by lower premiums in our credit surety line largely due to the timing of renewals. As we mentioned each quarter, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant deals and the timing of renewals. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 90% for the second quarter of compared to 96% last year. The six point decrease was primarily driven by both a lower loss ratio and expense ratio. The decrease in the loss ratio was primarily driven by improved results on our property product lines. The decrease in expense ratio was driven by the benefit of higher earned premiums, along with lower profit-sharing expense. The combined ratio for the first six months for the reinsurance segment was 102% versus 97% for the same period year. The five point increase was driven by higher current accident year loss ratio due to $32 million or seven point of direct COVID-19 losses recorded in the first quarter, that was partially offset by a lower expense ratio due to lower acquisition cost. Next I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations and as a reminder, amounts for our program services and ILS operations are reported within services and other revenue expenses within our operating results. Starting with state national, gross written premium volume for state national program services operation was down on both a quarter and year-to-date basis driven by the runoff of one large program and the enforced cancellation of another large program, which resulted in a onetime unfavorable premium adjustment. As a reminder almost all of state national's gross written premium is ceded. Ceding fee revenue was flat for the quarter and the year. We saw improvement in our operating expenses for the quarter as a result of lower profit-sharing expenses. Turning to our ILS operations, our combined ILS operations has -- from our ILS operations increased 9% from the prior year's quarter and are up 4% for the year to date period, which has been driven by growth from our Nephila MGA operations. That growth is being partially offset by a reduction in management fees coming from both CATCo and Nephila, as a result of lower AUM and a reduction in management fees charged on side-pocket. Operating expenses from ILS decreased compared to the prior year, which is primarily due to fewer professional fees associated with the internal review and Markel CATCo, partially offset by continued startup costs associated with our retro ILS fund manager Lodgepine. Nephila expenses were in line with the prior year. I'll finish up with some market commentary; it's very clearly we've entered a hard market for most insurance and reinsurance lines. Some of the factors driving the hard market are concerns around social inflation, historically low interest rates, recent financial market volatility, elevated recent natural catastrophe activity and significant uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and those include the potential for regulatory action or litigation that would expand the insurance industry's loss exposure. Areas most impacted in rare rates are increasing the most end factors are general liability, professional liability and property line. However, with the exception of Workers Comp all lines are seeing some form of rate increase and/or improvement in terms, with those lines that saw strengthening this time last year compounding rate increases currently. Most of our largest lines are now seeing double-digit rate increases and that momentum appears sustainable. These rate increases are more than offset lower premium volume in classes hardest hit by the pandemic. As an example our Workers' Compensation business and really any business focused on small businesses, which had been hard hit by the economic closures and disruptions, those are under pressure. Despite continued unprecedented uncertainty, we entered the second half of the year with optimism. Thank you for your time today and now I'd like to turn it over to Tom.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Richie. I am pleased to report to you that we experienced a meaningful rebound in our investment portfolio during the second quarter. Equities rebounded 18% during the quarter following the 22% loss in the first quarter and outstanding negative 8.4% for the year-to-date. We continue to earn positive mark-to-market returns on our fixed income portfolio from lower levels of overall interest rates and essentially no credit losses given our long-standing commitment to very high credit quality. The total investment return for the portfolio after all expenses in foreign exchange effects was negative 0.3% for the 2020 year-to-date. Investments always operate within the overall context of the Markel Corporation. Our investments support the capital base we need operate our insurance businesses as well as to produce attractive total returns. We think that the current highest and best capital allocation decision we can make right now is to support the growth of our insurance operations. As witnessed in the second quarter results, insurance prices are going up and we are being paid more per unit of rest risk. First and foremost writing more and better priced insurance business looks to us like the best use of capital at Markel right now. Given the current opportunity to grow our insurance premiums and the top combination we experienced during the first quarter of negative returns on our equity portfolio and our underwriting operations, as well as the effects of tangible capital from the early days of our acquisitions and ventures and insurance-linked securities businesses, we decided to reduce our exposure to publicly traded equities during the market rally of the second quarter. Those sales along with the addition of the $600 million of preferred equity we raised puts us in excellent condition to take full advantage of current opportunities to grow our insurance operations and managed levels of uncertainty. Our individual equity purchase and sale decisions continue to be driven by our long-standing four step process of looking for businesses with good returns on capital and not much debt, run by managers with equal measures of talent and integrity with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline at fair prices. While the world is changing at a rapid pace, we believe those principles remain relevant and durable. We believe that the COVID-19 circumstances of 2020 in many cases reduced the long-term profitability of several companies. We also think that the infusion of liquidity into financial markets by governments around the world alter the ability to invest in prices that compensate us for the risks involved. In many cases we concluded that we would rather write insurance at current crisis and we acted according. At June 30 following net sales of approximately $1.2 billion. Equity stood at $5.7 billion of market cap which is 50% of our shareholders' equity of $11.4 billion. Our cash, short-term and longer-term fixed maturities stand at $16.6 billion. We expect to continue to build the cash and fixed income balances to reflect the increase inflows of insurance premiums during this period of growth and insurance. That stance should serve to increase our investment options going forward. While uncertainty and volatility will likely continue to dominate the landscape, well-priced insurance risk generate capital and future opportunities for all of Markel as the expected profitability gets recognized over time. We will revisit our allocation as our view of the risk-reward balance changes in insurance, investments or ventures. For right now, look for us to continue to build our cash and fixed income balances until conditions change. On ventures, I'm extremely proud of the businesses and the way that they have adapted to the unprecedented swift and dramatic changes over the last few months. As Jeremy mentioned earlier, revenues totaled $1.2 billion during the first six months of 2020 compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. EBITDA totaled $173 million compared to $160 million in previous year. Those result benefitted from the inclusion of VSC Fire & Security last year and one month of results from Lansing Building Products. Even without those additions, I am deeply encouraged by the results for Markel Ventures. In many cases, the ventures managers faced extreme conditions as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns and unprecedented changes in customer behavior and ordering patterns. Additionally, keeping our workforce safe and manufacturing and field service operations continues to require new procedures and challenges. I am incredibly proud of how the people at ventures companies adapted to serve their customers and each other throughout this time. Those challenges all continue and we are by no means out of the woods, but I think the performance of the businesses in 2020 stands a testament to the value they bring to their customers. We do not anticipate any acquisitions in the Ventures Group in the near-term. We continue to think that the best current capital allocation decision is to support the growth and opportunity in our insurance business. We continue to believe that Markel continues to be served well by our diversified three engine strategy of building excellent insurance investment and ventures operations. While COVID-19 created a whirling negative cluster that eliminated the normal benefits of diversification during the first quarter, we're pleased to report rebounds and improvement to you this quarter. We look forward to future years when we get to use the word usual and in the word unprecedented and we appreciate your long-term support and partnership as we get from here to there. With that, thank you very much and we'd now like to answer your questions. Operator if you can open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Go ahead.\nMark Hughes: The ILS business could you give us a sense of your outlook there in terms of assets and this overall activity?\nRichard Whitt: Yeah Mark, Richie here. I think the outlook is positive. I think we commented on the call last quarter that as of the COVID-19 situation was unfolding as markets were becoming incredibly volatile, I think this people's decisions on asset allocation I think they were basically frozen. As things have rebounded as there's been little more calm in the markets, we have definitely seen an uptick in terms of conversations. People are getting more comfortable with doing their due diligence virtually as opposed to on-site and so we're very hopeful that we will see additional mandates in terms of AUM in the second half of the year. So very -- feels very different today than it did back in March-April.\nMark Hughes: And then in the insurance operation the GL you described as a very good growth opportunity. There's been I think you've expressed concerns about the social inflation, but you seem to be writing a lot of business and you had a favorable development in the quarter. Is social inflation as much of an issue now in the GL line?\nThomas Gayner: Again COVID-19 has changed just about every aspect of life and I think we still have to get some time to see how COVID-19 impacts social inflation, but there's no doubt we were seeing social inflation before COVID started. I think there were probably some aspect of social inflation going on. How that plays out I don't know, but given the level of rate increase, we'll given where our portfolio was and giving the level of rate increases we're now seeing, I feel pretty comfortable that that is running ahead of social -- whatever we would be seeing in terms of social inflation.\nMark Hughes: And then finally on Workers Comp there has been discussion of maybe that stabilizing at some point in the near future here. How do you see that?\nThomas Gayner: Well, we were seeing some green shoots in May and June, but obviously we had hotspots developing, we had some states considering and in some cases going backwards in terms of opening up. So I think we have to see what impact that has on the Workers Comp line. What we've seen so far in terms of Workers Comp is the impact the COVID-19 on the top line i.e. premium and people either canceling policies or premium being returned, that impact is looking much bigger than the impact on the loss line i.e. paying for COVID-19 claims. So our Workers Comp has held up reasonably well, but I think it's going to face headwinds until the COVID-19 situation is better under control.\nMark Hughes: How about pricing there in comp?\nThomas Gayner: Pricing has been down for several quarters because just the results have been so good in Workers Comp. I think the pressure on pricing is moderating. It is probably still negative at this point, but I would say that pressure is moderating, but that's being offset to some extent by there is just less business out there and we in particular, we focus on small business and obviously small businesses have been hit pretty hard by COVID-19.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Go ahead.\nJeff Schmitt: You had mentioned the rate environment obviously really good seen double-digit rate increases in quite a few lines, could you maybe just provides some more details of numbers behind that and some of the highest growth lines.\nThomas Gayner: Some of the areas we're seeing the highest rates are I think this is fairly consistent with what you've probably heard on other calls. General liability, casualty and professional liability are probably leading the pack and we're seeing sort of solid mid-teens in those two areas. Obviously property that's approaching 20% sort of rates. We've been -- we're pretty flat in property, which means we've been getting rate increase, but we've actually been reducing in exposure and that's been part of our plans is to reduce our net cat volatility. We have always been big writers of professional and casualty and that is where we're seeing the biggest rate increases and I think that that's why you're seeing us growing at right grow we're growing in the first half of the year.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then the EMS [ph] it seems like voice [ph] in particular could be hit more by the pandemic and they had been pulling back, AIG had been pulling back, Are you seeing even more dislocation there from the pandemic more opportunities to grow?\nThomas Gayner: Yeah I think there is clearly dislocation and in those three areas probably are the areas, the prices are sort of the highest there. So that would suggest that's the areas of the highest level of dislocation, casualty, professional and property. It is obviously COVID-19 as part of it, but keep in mind things were moving in this direction even before COVID-19 as a result of social inflation in those other items that I talked about. But without a doubt, we're pretty big players over in London. We're obviously a very big player in ENS and we are seeing significant business increases in both of those areas.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. Was there any catastrophe losses in the quarter?\nThomas Gayner: Absolutely, we had catastrophe losses, but we would have termed those sort of an attritional nature, not big enough to call out, but we certainly did have some catastrophe losses. We also had and I'm just anticipating the question, civil commotion losses, yes we had some of those as well. At this point again, we see those more in an attritional sort of nature and not big enough to call out specifically in our results.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Fox from Fenimore Asset Management. Go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Richie, I was just going to ask you why you didn't have any protest or weather losses in the quarter, but I'll move on. What's the threshold on that materiality, will you disclose it?\nRichard Whitt: We don\u2019t have any specific number John, but $10 million to $20 million, we would want to see an event being larger than that before we would break it out in the numbers.\nThomas Gayner: I might interrupt Richie. WE would actually not want to see that larger number.\nJohn Fox: Good point.\nRichard Whitt: Yeah $10 million to $20 million would need to get to that sort of level before we call it out in the results.\nJohn Fox: So your accident year numbers include those losses and that's just kind of being in the insurance business. So you didn\u2019t break it out?\nRichard Whitt: Exactly, it had been those things, it would've been something else.\nJohn Fox: All the surprises of insurance are negative like someone once said. Tom, I'm remembering that Markel Ventures reports on a one quarter lag, is that correct?\nThomas Gayner: One month lag, one month.\nJohn Fox: One month lag okay. So I was not correct and so the economic environment of April and May is in the June quarter.\nThomas Gayner: That's exactly right and that's what I try to convey, some of those businesses are day one of stoppages just that's a myocardial infarction and their ability to adjust and adapt and recapture some business and get things rolling, I understand it's like the amazement of what some of those managers have done.\nJohn Fox: Well, that's great. Thank you. And you can extend my thanks. I have a bigger picture question, I noticed what you did in the equity portfolio reading the Q last night and I noticed in an environment of very strong reinsurance pricing that you're not writing a lot more premium and so I just had the observation, it looks like they're derisking the company and like you comment on that and are you doing that because the great opportunities insurance because over the last few years, the results have been quite volatile and you're trying to reduce that the overall general environment with the virus? Can you just take all those things or maybe other things you're thinking about and comment on my observation?\nThomas Gayner: Sure. Well to a large extent I think you managed to drove your question. All of those factors play into exactly what's going on. So first off as reported you just take the second quarter numbers on a standalone basis. We reported an 88%, so given the ability to write insurance premium and given 88% combined ratio, what to do as much of that as we possibly can and cash and fixed income investments of this kind is the flavor of capital that rating agencies and regulators like the most when you're backing that sort of opportunity. So if we can write insurance at 88%, we are spectacularly inclined to do so to the fullest extent possible. Secondly, in terms of the rate per unit of risk which Richie used that phrase and I would use the exact same thing. When we look at the landscape of things we can do, again the rate per unit of risk right now is best in the insurance world. So when we take the microscope and examine everything that we own whether it's in equity or fixed-income securities goods compared against the opportunity cost and the comparison of the other things we can do and we think logically as we follow that analysis. And then your point about sort of the results of the last years some volatility, within the insurance book itself, there is some lines which tend to be more volatile and some that tend to be less volatile and if we're able to get an 88% on something that's less volatile rather than more volatile and more [indiscernible] well you would want to do the stuff that's less volatile. So I think if the roles are reversed John, you would go to the same sort of logic change to make the sort of decisions that we're making.\nJohn Fox: Great and on $7 billion of tangible capital including the preferred, your writing at $0.50 on the dollar in terms of premium and what's the potential for that to increase? How much premium leverage do you think you could add?\nJeremy Noble: I think we can continue to grow. The market opportunity is there and I don't think we're restricted in terms of our capital base. So I think I've said in my comments, we think it's hard what we're seeing in terms of the market is sustainable and our goal is to write as much of it as we possibly can. Bob Cox who is on the who runs our insurance operations, he likes to say every day that get us by is one day closer to the end of the hard market and we want to make sure we take advantage of every day.\nJohn Fox: The $6 million of earned at 8% underwriting profit would be very nice.\nJeremy Noble: So we're shooting for.\nJohn Fox: Okay. And Richie in ILS are the expenses there at the level, is that the run rate or are there still legal expenses in there or how should we think about that?\nRichard Whitt: Yeah the picture is still a bit muddied with the legal expenses from CATCo, but I can tell you, we are very -- we are very optimistic in terms of our opportunity to raise capital into the second half of the year and even more so into '21 and that there's tremendous leverage in that business. As we are able to add AUM, the expense base really does not have to move a lot. A great majority of that should drop to the bottom line and that's -- so we're hoping for over the next 18 or so months.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Dwelle from RBC. Go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Good morning. I guess I've three questions. First Richie you had talked about the COVID-19 charge that you took last quarter and that it had held up well and so forth in terms of the reserving practice. Could you -- I guess the question I am going to ask is are you still lighting business in areas like event cancellation and some of the other lines that you referred to that were generating charges and if so, what you might have done as far as terms and conditions etcetera in order to stay in those markets?\nRichard Whitt: We are writing very little event cancellation today. We put a moratorium on writing event when the COVID-19 situation broke. To the extent we write going forward it would have to have a communicable disease exclusion, but the likelihood is we will write considerably less of that business going forward. It was a fairly small line for us, but it had an outsized loss in this event and we're trying to avoid those sort of businesses, small businesses that create big losses, that's not what we want. In terms of property, we've always had for the most part virus exclusions and of course the property policies are constructed, physical damage is required first, we have been reducing our property exposure not so much because of COVID, but certainly COVID is in the mix. We've been reducing our property exposure to reduce the natural cap volatility that it brings. So of the lines that have been heavily exposed to COVID, we're writing less of those today.\nMark Dwelle: And second question is for Tom, it mainly relates to ventures, the obviously had a very, very strong quarter and so I am going to ask for kind of an unprecedented piece of information from you. Could you share what portion of the revenues in the quarter came from recent acquisitions? I am trying to triangulate kind of what the underlying run rate was on the ongoing businesses and that's the reason I was asking?\nThomas Gayner: I am looking at Jeremy as I answer the question. I think on a same-store basis, so without lasting our VSC in there, revenues were down about 14% in the quarter year-over-year and EBITDA was down about 7%. So that the rough.\nMark Dwelle: And then the last question that I had when you just commented to the last gentlemen about the strong capital position and the ability to grow, but then you did a preferred offering in the quarter fairly substantial and I guess I was curious to just talk through why you chose a preferred offering and why you felt you needed capital at this particular point in time?\nJeremy Noble: Hey Mark, it's Jeremy. Couple of thoughts there. So certainly to some extent that was to improve liquidity and capital position in the short term and adequately respond to some of the uncertainties that were existing in May relative to COVID-19 also and we saw this playing out in the second quarter. We thought we would be able to deploy capital into our insurance operations to take advantage of improving market conditions and opportunities that we are beginning to see in the specialty insurance marketplace and some of that is played out in the second quarter and obviously Richie was commenting on that a little bit earlier. With regards to the structure and we've looked at hybrid capital in the past. We felt that it May that was a good time to kind of add preferred stock to our capital structure. We recognize a number of peers across our industry had done similar in their capital structure and we like the fact that it's capital for rating agency purposes and accounting purposes. We were comfortable increasing the overall financial leverage, but we were focused on not increasing our debt leverage at the time.\nRichard Whitt: And I might add to Jeremy's point, as we've looked at hybrid capital, in fact we used hybrid forms of capital several times over the course of last 30 years and the guiding principle there is oftentimes there's some distinctions between GAAP financial capital and what regulators look at, what rating agencies look at and we always want to take care of the shareholders and protect their common equity to the extent possible. So you sort of have to respond to the situation, look at what specific securities are available that meet the needs and given the opportunity to refinance that or pay that back in some sort of identifiable timeframe that keeps the common equity and plain shareholders in the best possible position.\nOperator: Our next question comes is from Philip Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nPhilip Stefano: I guess this is probably not on the prior question with the unprecedented information on the acquisition and ventures. Is there a way we could think about the potential forward impact to these acquisitions and lay out what the expectations are for the underlying business versus the benefit that we have from these acquisitions coming online?\nRichard Whitt: In economic senses we always think that we're going to make double-digit returns on capital and we lay out a dollar of capital in the form of an acquisition. So that's the way we're underwriting and that would -- that would lay out there as the longer-term. In the short term, there could be all kind of volatility around that. I would report to you that so far again I'm just very impressed and very grateful in the way that the managers of those businesses continue to operate them and wildly fluctuating circumstances. So the reports of the first six months where those companies are operating in black, producing cash flows and just when we wake up to any given day, they're doing pretty well. I would not want to put to find a point where I had a model number for the next quarter to do expectations or forward guidance in that sense.\nPhilip Stefano: And looking at the underwriting feel -- looking at the underwriting businesses it feels like there's a growing expectation and maybe at this point even a frustration in some respect, that we're getting this headline pricing increases, but it feels like loss cost expectations are increasing as well and we're just -- we're not getting underlying or attritional loss ratio improvement that I think people had been hoping for. How can we think about loss cost trends versus pricing over a period of time and the dynamics we have today versus the dynamic of five years ago and what that could mean for attritional underwriting margin as we look over the next couple of quarters or years?\nThomas Gayner: That's an interesting one. Let me -- I'll try it Phil. I've said that it's a little difficult to put your finger on what social inflation is doing right now because of all the COVID issues and what's happened in the economy, I think that that has muddied the waters there. I do believe in terms of pricing that is happening right now, I believe we're starting to create a margin against any sort of reasonable expectation of social inflation. When we start hitting mid-teens in terms of price increases and that's coming on and we're now to a point where that's compounding on some price increases that we received in 2019. I have to believe just based on what we've seen in terms social inflation in the past that it's nothing new that that is creating some margin against that. So my hope would be if this is a sustainable market for a while, I think we should be able to create some additional margin against social inflation and hopefully see those attritional loss ratios bump down a bit. Tom likes to say hey this quarter we're -- that's one quarter in a row. So we've got one quarter in a row. We're going to see if we can make it two quarters in a row next quarter.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it and then the last one for me and I apologize if I missed it earlier, any updates on Lodgepine and that will be the fundraising that's going there?\nThomas Gayner: Again we've done a lot of I've kind of said in the first quarter up through about May I think most investors were pretty frozen trying to kind of assess what had happened to their portfolios. We've seen a significant change in tone and the amount of conversations and the amount due diligence that's going on. It's picking that up. That book is a one-one book largely it's a January 01 book and so quite honestly people aren\u2019t going to make their decisions until probably into the fall as to whether they want to invest. We're having some great conversation, but I think just the way the calendar works, we're not going to have assigned commitments until sometime in the fall.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Hughes from SunTrust. Go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Just a couple of quick ones. Any comments on medical professional liability line?\nThomas Gayner: Mark we used, there used to be a really big part of what we did and just that market has been challenged for a number of years and so it's become a much smaller part of what we do, but as I said most lines are improving and there is certainly improvement in the health lines the broader health lines and we're taking advantage of that. But the base we're starting with is much smaller than it was several years ago because of that challenged environment.\nMark Hughes: And then when we think about your new business through the quarter you were up 14% in insurance and written premium. Was that more weighted to the back part of the quarter and is that more of a better run rate on a go-forward basis?\nThomas Gayner: It's been relatively consistent in sort of that mid-teens first and second quarter. Whether we've seen all of the impact of COVID-19 your guess is as good as mine. It certainly hurts our smaller businesses, but that's been more than made up for by price increases and more business coming in both ENS in London. So that sort of mid-teens is -- that seems to be the run rate through the first six months.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for closing remarks.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks Jeremy and good morning, everyone. The first half of 2020 has been more eventful and volatile than most full years. We have a fantastic plan in building momentum as we entered 2020. We were executing well until COVID-19 hit with its unprecedented cap-like fury on a global scale impacting every industry, geography and community. Thanks to our dedicated employees, we took that first quarter hit, we quickly adapted and we staged a furious comeback in the second quarter. While we recognize there are still significant uncertainties, the 2020 underwriting year is far from loss. We believe to a person that we can make up significant ground over the next six months. This will require staying focused on what we can control and preparing as best possible for those things not in our control. As Jeremy mentioned related to the COVID the direct COVID-19 loss reserves, we did not adjust our original $325 million provision for direct COVID-19 losses in the second quarter. This is largely due to the fact that we've not seen evidence either positive or negative that would require us to change our estimate. Claims are materializing largely as we estimated and are being reserved and settled in line with our original assumptions. Despite the fact that we made no changes to our original estimate, the ongoing nature and uniqueness of the COVID-19 pandemic means the range of potential outcomes is wider than any catastrophe we've ever seen. Now I'll discuss our insurance businesses, which include our underwriting operations, our state national program services operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. Since starting with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter were up $185 million or 14% compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the first six months, premiums were up $407 million or 16%. Premium growth for both the quarter and first six months was driven by continued organic new business growth and rate increases in our professional liability and general liability products along with growth this quarter in our marine and energy products. The combined ratio for the insurance segment was 88% for the second quarter of 2020 compared to 95% last year. The seven point improvement in the combined ratio was driven by more favorable development on prior accident year's loss reserves, a lower expense ratio and a lower current accident year loss ratio. This is a rare insurance trifecta. The increase in favorable development on prior accident year's losses was primarily driven by our property and general liability lines. The combined ratio of the first six months for the insurance segment was $103 million versus 95% for the same period a year ago. The eight point increase in the combined ratio was driven primarily by $293 million or 13 points of losses attributed to direct COVID-19 exposures recorded in the first quarter. The impact from COVID losses was partially offset by an increase in favorable development on prior accident year losses, primarily in our professional liability and property product lines. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and six-month within our insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on the prior year's loss ratio. Turning to our reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for both the quarter and the year are flat compared to the same periods in 2019. In this quarter, we saw higher gross written premiums in our professional liability line due to favorable timing differences and favorable premium adjustments offset by lower premiums in our product line -- at our property line and that is aligned with their strategy to reduce natural catastrophe volatility. For the year, we saw higher gross premiums in Worker's Compensation driven by a large relationship offset by lower premiums in our credit surety line largely due to the timing of renewals. As we mentioned each quarter, significant volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to individually significant deals and the timing of renewals. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 90% for the second quarter of compared to 96% last year. The six point decrease was primarily driven by both a lower loss ratio and expense ratio. The decrease in the loss ratio was primarily driven by improved results on our property product lines. The decrease in expense ratio was driven by the benefit of higher earned premiums, along with lower profit-sharing expense. The combined ratio for the first six months for the reinsurance segment was 102% versus 97% for the same period year. The five point increase was driven by higher current accident year loss ratio due to $32 million or seven point of direct COVID-19 losses recorded in the first quarter, that was partially offset by a lower expense ratio due to lower acquisition cost. Next I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations and as a reminder, amounts for our program services and ILS operations are reported within services and other revenue expenses within our operating results. Starting with state national, gross written premium volume for state national program services operation was down on both a quarter and year-to-date basis driven by the runoff of one large program and the enforced cancellation of another large program, which resulted in a onetime unfavorable premium adjustment. As a reminder almost all of state national's gross written premium is ceded. Ceding fee revenue was flat for the quarter and the year. We saw improvement in our operating expenses for the quarter as a result of lower profit-sharing expenses. Turning to our ILS operations, our combined ILS operations has -- from our ILS operations increased 9% from the prior year's quarter and are up 4% for the year to date period, which has been driven by growth from our Nephila MGA operations. That growth is being partially offset by a reduction in management fees coming from both CATCo and Nephila, as a result of lower AUM and a reduction in management fees charged on side-pocket. Operating expenses from ILS decreased compared to the prior year, which is primarily due to fewer professional fees associated with the internal review and Markel CATCo, partially offset by continued startup costs associated with our retro ILS fund manager Lodgepine. Nephila expenses were in line with the prior year. I'll finish up with some market commentary; it's very clearly we've entered a hard market for most insurance and reinsurance lines. Some of the factors driving the hard market are concerns around social inflation, historically low interest rates, recent financial market volatility, elevated recent natural catastrophe activity and significant uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and those include the potential for regulatory action or litigation that would expand the insurance industry's loss exposure. Areas most impacted in rare rates are increasing the most end factors are general liability, professional liability and property line. However, with the exception of Workers Comp all lines are seeing some form of rate increase and/or improvement in terms, with those lines that saw strengthening this time last year compounding rate increases currently. Most of our largest lines are now seeing double-digit rate increases and that momentum appears sustainable. These rate increases are more than offset lower premium volume in classes hardest hit by the pandemic. As an example our Workers' Compensation business and really any business focused on small businesses, which had been hard hit by the economic closures and disruptions, those are under pressure. Despite continued unprecedented uncertainty, we entered the second half of the year with optimism. Thank you for your time today and now I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Yeah Mark, Richie here. I think the outlook is positive. I think we commented on the call last quarter that as of the COVID-19 situation was unfolding as markets were becoming incredibly volatile, I think this people's decisions on asset allocation I think they were basically frozen. As things have rebounded as there's been little more calm in the markets, we have definitely seen an uptick in terms of conversations. People are getting more comfortable with doing their due diligence virtually as opposed to on-site and so we're very hopeful that we will see additional mandates in terms of AUM in the second half of the year. So very -- feels very different today than it did back in March-April. We don't have any specific number John, but $10 million to $20 million, we would want to see an event being larger than that before we would break it out in the numbers. Yeah $10 million to $20 million would need to get to that sort of level before we call it out in the results. Exactly, it had been those things, it would've been something else. Yeah the picture is still a bit muddied with the legal expenses from CATCo, but I can tell you, we are very -- we are very optimistic in terms of our opportunity to raise capital into the second half of the year and even more so into '21 and that there's tremendous leverage in that business. As we are able to add AUM, the expense base really does not have to move a lot. A great majority of that should drop to the bottom line and that's -- so we're hoping for over the next 18 or so months. We are writing very little event cancellation today. We put a moratorium on writing event when the COVID-19 situation broke. To the extent we write going forward it would have to have a communicable disease exclusion, but the likelihood is we will write considerably less of that business going forward. It was a fairly small line for us, but it had an outsized loss in this event and we're trying to avoid those sort of businesses, small businesses that create big losses, that's not what we want. In terms of property, we've always had for the most part virus exclusions and of course the property policies are constructed, physical damage is required first, we have been reducing our property exposure not so much because of COVID, but certainly COVID is in the mix.

            "name": "Thomas Gayner",
            "content": "Thanks so much. Good morning, and welcome to the Markel Corporation second quarter conference call. This is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined today as usual by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; as well as our CFO, Jeremy Noble. That maybe the last time we get to use the world, usual, in this call. It doesn't seem to be much that would fall into the camp of usual these days. In fact I've commented for the last several months that there is an unprecedented use of the word unprecedented. So far in 2020, unprecedented strikes me as the right word to use. I look forward to the day it becomes an overused cliche\u0301, but I don't think were there yet. Despite the unprecedented conditions that we and everyone else face, we've got good news to report to you this morning. Across Markel, in every business and for every customer, our people exhibited unusual and spectacular adaptability and dedication to serve our customers and each other. Our second quarter results, meaningful growth and profitability in each of the three engines of insurance, investments and ventures, reflect their efforts. All of the associates of Markel worked unbelievably hard and with great dedication and creativity to find a way forward. Speaking for Richie and Jeremy I want to extend our thanks to our dedicated associates in the way in which the people of Markel have adapted and persisted to serve our customers in this unprecedented conditions triggered by the Coronavirus. Now while much of today's call will focus on financial measurements and the effects of COVID-19 I want to take a moment to also address another virus we're facing as a society, namely the virus of racism. Let me be clear, we explicitly reject racism and discrimination. We are fully committed to the dignity and worth of each and every individual. During the last few months, Richie and I had the opportunity to listen to many of our associates and hear their voices and stories in new ways. We are listening and learning. I think the difficult conversations are having a very positive effect. We're confronting issues and problems that we haven't faced before in such a head-on way. The honesty and openness is refreshing and I think it gives us all a chance to learn in a new way and to make real progress. We mean the word to the Markel style. Those words include fairness in all our dealings and providing an atmosphere which people can reach their personal potential. We cite those core beliefs because they are crucial components behind another statement in the style, namely the question, find a better way to do this. Count on our consistent commitment to these ideas. At this point, I am going to turn to the financial reports in the second quarter. Jeremy, will provide you with an update on the numbers and then Richie will update you on our insurance and insurance-linked securities operations. I will then follow with comments on our investments and ventures operations. After that, we look forward to answering your questions. Jeremy. Thank you, Richie. I am pleased to report to you that we experienced a meaningful rebound in our investment portfolio during the second quarter. Equities rebounded 18% during the quarter following the 22% loss in the first quarter and outstanding negative 8.4% for the year-to-date. We continue to earn positive mark-to-market returns on our fixed income portfolio from lower levels of overall interest rates and essentially no credit losses given our long-standing commitment to very high credit quality. The total investment return for the portfolio after all expenses in foreign exchange effects was negative 0.3% for the 2020 year-to-date. Investments always operate within the overall context of the Markel Corporation. Our investments support the capital base we need operate our insurance businesses as well as to produce attractive total returns. We think that the current highest and best capital allocation decision we can make right now is to support the growth of our insurance operations. As witnessed in the second quarter results, insurance prices are going up and we are being paid more per unit of rest risk. First and foremost writing more and better priced insurance business looks to us like the best use of capital at Markel right now. Given the current opportunity to grow our insurance premiums and the top combination we experienced during the first quarter of negative returns on our equity portfolio and our underwriting operations, as well as the effects of tangible capital from the early days of our acquisitions and ventures and insurance-linked securities businesses, we decided to reduce our exposure to publicly traded equities during the market rally of the second quarter. Those sales along with the addition of the $600 million of preferred equity we raised puts us in excellent condition to take full advantage of current opportunities to grow our insurance operations and managed levels of uncertainty. Our individual equity purchase and sale decisions continue to be driven by our long-standing four step process of looking for businesses with good returns on capital and not much debt, run by managers with equal measures of talent and integrity with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline at fair prices. While the world is changing at a rapid pace, we believe those principles remain relevant and durable. We believe that the COVID-19 circumstances of 2020 in many cases reduced the long-term profitability of several companies. We also think that the infusion of liquidity into financial markets by governments around the world alter the ability to invest in prices that compensate us for the risks involved. In many cases we concluded that we would rather write insurance at current crisis and we acted according. At June 30 following net sales of approximately $1.2 billion. Equity stood at $5.7 billion of market cap which is 50% of our shareholders' equity of $11.4 billion. Our cash, short-term and longer-term fixed maturities stand at $16.6 billion. We expect to continue to build the cash and fixed income balances to reflect the increase inflows of insurance premiums during this period of growth and insurance. That stance should serve to increase our investment options going forward. While uncertainty and volatility will likely continue to dominate the landscape, well-priced insurance risk generate capital and future opportunities for all of Markel as the expected profitability gets recognized over time. We will revisit our allocation as our view of the risk-reward balance changes in insurance, investments or ventures. For right now, look for us to continue to build our cash and fixed income balances until conditions change. On ventures, I'm extremely proud of the businesses and the way that they have adapted to the unprecedented swift and dramatic changes over the last few months. As Jeremy mentioned earlier, revenues totaled $1.2 billion during the first six months of 2020 compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. EBITDA totaled $173 million compared to $160 million in previous year. Those result benefitted from the inclusion of VSC Fire & Security last year and one month of results from Lansing Building Products. Even without those additions, I am deeply encouraged by the results for Markel Ventures. In many cases, the ventures managers faced extreme conditions as a result of COVID-19 shutdowns and unprecedented changes in customer behavior and ordering patterns. Additionally, keeping our workforce safe and manufacturing and field service operations continues to require new procedures and challenges. I am incredibly proud of how the people at ventures companies adapted to serve their customers and each other throughout this time. Those challenges all continue and we are by no means out of the woods, but I think the performance of the businesses in 2020 stands a testament to the value they bring to their customers. We do not anticipate any acquisitions in the Ventures Group in the near-term. We continue to think that the best current capital allocation decision is to support the growth and opportunity in our insurance business. We continue to believe that Markel continues to be served well by our diversified three engine strategy of building excellent insurance investment and ventures operations. While COVID-19 created a whirling negative cluster that eliminated the normal benefits of diversification during the first quarter, we're pleased to report rebounds and improvement to you this quarter. We look forward to future years when we get to use the word usual and in the word unprecedented and we appreciate your long-term support and partnership as we get from here to there. With that, thank you very much and we'd now like to answer your questions. Operator if you can open the line for questions. Again COVID-19 has changed just about every aspect of life and I think we still have to get some time to see how COVID-19 impacts social inflation, but there's no doubt we were seeing social inflation before COVID started. I think there were probably some aspect of social inflation going on. How that plays out I don't know, but given the level of rate increase, we'll given where our portfolio was and giving the level of rate increases we're now seeing, I feel pretty comfortable that that is running ahead of social -- whatever we would be seeing in terms of social inflation. Well, we were seeing some green shoots in May and June, but obviously we had hotspots developing, we had some states considering and in some cases going backwards in terms of opening up. So I think we have to see what impact that has on the Workers Comp line. What we've seen so far in terms of Workers Comp is the impact the COVID-19 on the top line i.e. premium and people either canceling policies or premium being returned, that impact is looking much bigger than the impact on the loss line i.e. paying for COVID-19 claims. So our Workers Comp has held up reasonably well, but I think it's going to face headwinds until the COVID-19 situation is better under control. Pricing has been down for several quarters because just the results have been so good in Workers Comp. I think the pressure on pricing is moderating. It is probably still negative at this point, but I would say that pressure is moderating, but that's being offset to some extent by there is just less business out there and we in particular, we focus on small business and obviously small businesses have been hit pretty hard by COVID-19. Some of the areas we're seeing the highest rates are I think this is fairly consistent with what you've probably heard on other calls. General liability, casualty and professional liability are probably leading the pack and we're seeing sort of solid mid-teens in those two areas. Obviously property that's approaching 20% sort of rates. We've been -- we're pretty flat in property, which means we've been getting rate increase, but we've actually been reducing in exposure and that's been part of our plans is to reduce our net cat volatility. We have always been big writers of professional and casualty and that is where we're seeing the biggest rate increases and I think that that's why you're seeing us growing at right grow we're growing in the first half of the year. Yeah I think there is clearly dislocation and in those three areas probably are the areas, the prices are sort of the highest there. So that would suggest that's the areas of the highest level of dislocation, casualty, professional and property. It is obviously COVID-19 as part of it, but keep in mind things were moving in this direction even before COVID-19 as a result of social inflation in those other items that I talked about. But without a doubt, we're pretty big players over in London. We're obviously a very big player in ENS and we are seeing significant business increases in both of those areas. Absolutely, we had catastrophe losses, but we would have termed those sort of an attritional nature, not big enough to call out, but we certainly did have some catastrophe losses. We also had and I'm just anticipating the question, civil commotion losses, yes we had some of those as well. At this point again, we see those more in an attritional sort of nature and not big enough to call out specifically in our results. I might interrupt Richie. WE would actually not want to see that larger number. One month lag, one month. That's exactly right and that's what I try to convey, some of those businesses are day one of stoppages just that's a myocardial infarction and their ability to adjust and adapt and recapture some business and get things rolling, I understand it's like the amazement of what some of those managers have done. Sure. Well to a large extent I think you managed to drove your question. All of those factors play into exactly what's going on. So first off as reported you just take the second quarter numbers on a standalone basis. We reported an 88%, so given the ability to write insurance premium and given 88% combined ratio, what to do as much of that as we possibly can and cash and fixed income investments of this kind is the flavor of capital that rating agencies and regulators like the most when you're backing that sort of opportunity. So if we can write insurance at 88%, we are spectacularly inclined to do so to the fullest extent possible. Secondly, in terms of the rate per unit of risk which Richie used that phrase and I would use the exact same thing. When we look at the landscape of things we can do, again the rate per unit of risk right now is best in the insurance world. So when we take the microscope and examine everything that we own whether it's in equity or fixed-income securities goods compared against the opportunity cost and the comparison of the other things we can do and we think logically as we follow that analysis. And then your point about sort of the results of the last years some volatility, within the insurance book itself, there is some lines which tend to be more volatile and some that tend to be less volatile and if we're able to get an 88% on something that's less volatile rather than more volatile and more [indiscernible] well you would want to do the stuff that's less volatile. So I think if the roles are reversed John, you would go to the same sort of logic change to make the sort of decisions that we're making. I am looking at Jeremy as I answer the question. I think on a same-store basis, so without lasting our VSC in there, revenues were down about 14% in the quarter year-over-year and EBITDA was down about 7%. So that the rough. That's an interesting one. Let me -- I'll try it Phil. I've said that it's a little difficult to put your finger on what social inflation is doing right now because of all the COVID issues and what's happened in the economy, I think that that has muddied the waters there. I do believe in terms of pricing that is happening right now, I believe we're starting to create a margin against any sort of reasonable expectation of social inflation. When we start hitting mid-teens in terms of price increases and that's coming on and we're now to a point where that's compounding on some price increases that we received in 2019. I have to believe just based on what we've seen in terms social inflation in the past that it's nothing new that that is creating some margin against that. So my hope would be if this is a sustainable market for a while, I think we should be able to create some additional margin against social inflation and hopefully see those attritional loss ratios bump down a bit. Tom likes to say hey this quarter we're -- that's one quarter in a row. So we've got one quarter in a row. We're going to see if we can make it two quarters in a row next quarter. Again we've done a lot of I've kind of said in the first quarter up through about May I think most investors were pretty frozen trying to kind of assess what had happened to their portfolios. We've seen a significant change in tone and the amount of conversations and the amount due diligence that's going on. It's picking that up. That book is a one-one book largely it's a January 01 book and so quite honestly people aren't going to make their decisions until probably into the fall as to whether they want to invest. We're having some great conversation, but I think just the way the calendar works, we're not going to have assigned commitments until sometime in the fall. Mark we used, there used to be a really big part of what we did and just that market has been challenged for a number of years and so it's become a much smaller part of what we do, but as I said most lines are improving and there is certainly improvement in the health lines the broader health lines and we're taking advantage of that. But the base we're starting with is much smaller than it was several years ago because of that challenged environment. It's been relatively consistent in sort of that mid-teens first and second quarter. Whether we've seen all of the impact of COVID-19 your guess is as good as mine. It certainly hurts our smaller businesses, but that's been more than made up for by price increases and more business coming in both ENS in London. So that sort of mid-teens is -- that seems to be the run rate through the first six months. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you for your support. We look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom good morning, everyone. Our underwriting and testing in Markel ventures results for the first half of 2020 were meaningfully impacted by the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, but encouragingly, we saw positive contributions from each of our three engines during the second quarter. While COVID-19 has and likely will continue to influence both the asset and liability sides of our balance sheet, our financial condition was strong at the end of the second quarter. We are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that are being presented in the specialty insurance marketplace. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $3.7 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $3.3 million in 2019, an increase of 12%. This increase was due almost entirely to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $3 billion an increase of 16% compared to 2019. This growth related primarily to increased writings within our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy and personal lines product lines. Gross written premium within our reinsurance segment were as consistent in 2019 at roughly $740 million. Year-to-date retention of gross written premiums held at 84% in both 2020 and 2019. Earned premiums increased 12% to $2.7 million in 2020, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2020 was a 103% compared to a 95% in 2019. For the second quarter of 2020, we reported an 88% combined ratio to 95% for the year ago. As we discussed a quarter ago, we recognized $325 million of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses during the first quarter for those policies and contrast for COVID-19 was identified as a proximate cause of loss. There were no changes in our loss estimates during the second quarter. These COVID-19 losses increased our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months of 2020 at 12 points. Our initial estimates of losses directly attributable to COVID-19 and the end of March reflected limited claims reporting. However, after considering the additional data gathered through increased claims reporting activity in the second quarter and while continuing to monitor actual levels of disruption caused by the pandemic, there were no significant changes in our assumptions during the second quarter. As a reminder, our losses from COVID-19 are primarily attributed to business written within our international insurance operations, and primarily associated with coverages for event cancellation and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions surrounding COVID-19, which among other things include assumptions related to coverages, liability, reinsurance protection, duration and loss mitigation factors as well as the fact that the economic impacts of the pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates may be subject to a wide range of variability. As the overall pandemic continue to evolve, we expect losses indirectly related to COVID-19 pandemic and associated with a broader range of coverages are likely to emerge within our professional liability, trade credit and Workers Compensation product lines among others, including our reinsurance product lines. To date we've not seen significant evidence of incurred losses increasing for these secondary exposures and no explicit provision was made for indirect COVID-19 losses in the second quarter. It is worth noting that any increase in exposure associated with indirectly COVID-19 losses will lead to partially offset of an improving pricing environment. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our reserving philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $268 million in the first half of 2020 compared to a favorable prior year development of $189 million in 2019. Turning to our investment results, as I mentioned in prior calls given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, we continue to see volatility in the equity markets in the second quarter related to the economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the first quarter, we saw meaningful recoveries in the second quarter and investment losses for the first half of 2020 were $770 million compared to net investment gains of $1 million last year, a year-over-year decline of $1.8 million. With regards to net investment income, we reported $184 million in the first 2020 compared to $226 million in the first half of 2019. This decline is largely due to lower short-term interest rates, lower holding from fixed maturity securities in 2020. Net unrealized investment gains increased $237 million net of taxes during 2020 reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from declines in interest rates during the first half of the year. Now I'll cover the results of the Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $1.2 billion for the first half of 2020 compared to $1.1 billion last year. Higher revenues from our services businesses were partially offset by lower revenues within our products businesses. Revenues within our services businesses reflect the contribution of revenues from our acquisition of Lansing Building Products, which we completed in late April and acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019. Within our products businesses, the economic and social disruption caused by COVID-19 resulted in decreased demand in many of our businesses during the second quarter. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $173 million for the first half of 2020 compared to $160 million last year, reflecting the contributions of Lansing and VSC, partially offset the impact of lower operating revenues in certain of our business. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was at 21% for the first half of 2020 compared to 22% in 2019. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $484 million for the first half of 2020 compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.1 billion a year , driven by the net loss, comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first half 2020 was $260 million compared to comprehensive income of $1.4 million in 2019. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $489 million for the first half of 2020 compared to $249 million for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected the effects of lower claims settlement activity in both our insurance and reinsurance segments and higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. Invested assets at the holding company were $3.7 million at June 30 compared to $4 billion at the end of 2019. The decrease in holding company invested assets was due to funds used to acquire Lansing as well as the decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio again related to the impacts of COVID-19, all of which was partially offset by the proceeds from our preferred shares offering. We recognize the importance of liquidity and a strong balance sheet in times of uncertainty and we intend to ensure Markel as resilient for the long-term. In addition to the success, we began taking in early March to maintain our ongoing capital and liquidity needs to manage against volatility, in May 2020, we issued $600 million of 6% fixed rate reset noncumulative Series A preferred shares with no par value and the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for an aggregate net proceeds after expenses of $592 million. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality and investment grade securities with an average rating of AA, a debt to total capital ratio at the end of June was 24% unchanged from the end of 2019 and we have no unsecured senior debt maturing until July 2022. We believe we're well positioned to meet the ongoing capital liquidity needs including supporting growth in our insurance operations should we continue to see attractive opportunities in the specialty marketplace. Total shareholder's equity stood at $11.4 million as of the end of June compared to $11.1 million at year-end. Much of that a quarter ago, the unprecedented events surrounding COVID-19 certainly impacted our year-to-date results. However, the actions we've taken over the years to building diverse organization will help us navigate through the current uncertainty arising from this pandemic and we're well positioned to continue our efforts to build one of the world trade companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance business. I think we can continue to grow. The market opportunity is there and I don't think we're restricted in terms of our capital base. So I think I've said in my comments, we think it's hard what we're seeing in terms of the market is sustainable and our goal is to write as much of it as we possibly can. Bob Cox who is on the who runs our insurance operations, he likes to say every day that get us by is one day closer to the end of the hard market and we want to make sure we take advantage of every day. So we're shooting for. Hey Mark, it's Jeremy. Couple of thoughts there. So certainly to some extent that was to improve liquidity and capital position in the short term and adequately respond to some of the uncertainties that were existing in May relative to COVID-19 also and we saw this playing out in the second quarter. We thought we would be able to deploy capital into our insurance operations to take advantage of improving market conditions and opportunities that we are beginning to see in the specialty insurance marketplace and some of that is played out in the second quarter and obviously Richie was commenting on that a little bit earlier. With regards to the structure and we've looked at hybrid capital in the past. We felt that it May that was a good time to kind of add preferred stock to our capital structure. We recognize a number of peers across our industry had done similar in their capital structure and we like the fact that it's capital for rating agency purposes and accounting purposes. We were comfortable increasing the overall financial leverage, but we were focused on not increasing our debt leverage at the time."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nThomas Gayner: Good morning, and thank you, and welcome to the Markel Corporation First Quarter Conference Call. My name is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined today by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. While the nature of this call is financial, I want to start by thanking the people on the front lines. I want to thank the people who are manning our hospitals, our grocery stores, our utilities and countless other essential elements of our lives. I want to thank those that may not be in the headlines but do keep supply chains working. In many cases, the people of Markel provide many of the essential products and services I speak of, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for doing so. At the beginning of the year, we started with excellent operational momentum in our diversified insurance, investment and ventures operations. We entered the year with a conservative balance sheet, marked by high-quality fixed income holdings, no near-term debt maturities and a publicly traded equity portfolio that stood at 69% of shareholders' equity. Those equity securities had a cost basis of $3.3 billion and a market capitalization of $7.6 billion at that time. In mid-March, conditions changed suddenly and dramatically. COVID-19-driven shutdowns of the economy started to take place. Since that time, COVID-19 has come to dominate just about every aspect of life, and Markel is no exception. Our focus has been and will continue to be on building Markel over the long term. That said, current conditions must be addressed. We're making daily and continuous decisions as we navigate through this historic time, and we'll do our best to keep you informed of our progress as we do so. During today's call, Jeremy will update you on our numbers. Richie will discuss conditions in our insurance operations. Then I will return with comments about our investments and ventures operations. Following our brief comments, we will attempt to answer your questions. With that, Jeremy?\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment and echo Tom's sentiments of thanks and appreciation, first to medical professionals, frontline workers and public servants who are courageously and tirelessly taking care of our communities. I'm equally grateful to our employees around the globe. I've been impressed at how they are taking care of their families, customers, distribution partners and each other during these unprecedented times. So again, thank you. As you heard from Tom and saw in our earnings announcement, our consolidated quarterly performance was heavily influenced by COVID-19 and the adverse impact it had on both the assets and liabilities sides of our balance sheet, the effects which can be seen in the results of our insurance and investment engines. Looking at our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $1.9 billion for the quarter compared to $1.7 billion in 2019, an increase of 13%. This increase is almost entirely due to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $1.4 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the 2019 period. This growth is related primarily to increased writings within our professional liability and general liability product lines. Gross written premiums within our reinsurance segment were consistent with the 2019 period at just over $500 million. Retention of gross written premiums decreased to 85% from 87% in 2019, driven by lower retention within our reinsurance segment, resulting from purchases of additional outwards protection on our property product line as we seek to effectively manage capital and reduce volatility around catastrophe exposures. Earned premiums increased 11% to $1.3 billion in 2020 due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2020 was 118% compared to 95% in 2019. Here's where we begin to see the effects of COVID-19 on the liability side of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we recognized our best estimate of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $325 million for COVID-19. These COVID-19 losses increased our consolidated combined ratio by 24 points. So if you do the simple math, the consolidated combined ratio prior to the effects of COVID-19 was 94%. These reserves were established after detailed policy level reviews as well as a review of our in-force inwards and outwards reinsurance contracts. In those instances where we identified COVID-19 has the proximate cause of loss, we established loss reserves in the first quarter of 2020. Our losses from COVID-19 are primarily attributed to the business written within our international insurance operations and are primarily associated with coverages for event cancellation and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions around COVID-19 which, among other things, include assumptions related to coverages, liability, reinsurance protection, duration and loss mitigation factors as well as the fact that the economic impacts of the pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates may be subject to a wide range of variability. Excluding the effects of COVID-19, our current accident year loss ratio was higher year-over-year due to slightly higher attritional loss ratios in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. We have yet to reflect meaningful benefit from rate increases we've been achieving. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our loss reserving philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $104 million in the current quarter compared to favorable prior year development of $70 million in the first 3 months of 2019. Next, I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations, both of which are included in results of operations - sorry, results of other operations. Our gross written premium volume from our State National program services operations was down 28% to prior year, driven by the runoff of 1 large program and the cancellation of an in-force book of policies related to another large program, which resulted in the onetime unfavorable premium adjustment. As a reminder, almost all of this gross written premium is ceded. Ceding fee revenues were up 4% from last year due to growth in the program premium volumes during 2019. Turning quickly to our ILS operations. Our combined ILS operations have roughly $12.5 billion of net assets under management at the end of March 2020. Our Markel CATCo operations are continuing to wind down as they work to return investor capital as quickly and efficiently as possible. Revenues from our ILS operations were flat compared to prior year, with increases coming from our Nephila MGA operations being offset by decreases in management fees from Markel CATCo due to lower assets under management and a further reduction in management fees charged on side-pocket shares. Operating expenses from ILS decreased compared to the prior year, which is primarily due to fewer professional fees associated with the review and investigation in Markel CATCo. Turning to our investment results. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. To that point, here is where you see the COVID-19 impact on the asset side of our balance sheet. Net investment losses for the quarter were $1.7 billion compared to net investment gains of $612 million last year, a year-over-year decline of $2.3 billion. Essentially all of our net investment losses in 2020 were attributable to the decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the period as COVID-19 caused unprecedented volatility in the capital markets. We've continued to see volatility in the equity markets over the course of April, but have seen some of the equity price declines to reverse. With regards to net investment income, we reported $88 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $114 million a year ago, and the decline was mostly due to losses recognized on equity method investments. Net unrealized investment gains increased $66 million net of taxes during 2019, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from declines in interest rates during the first quarter. Now I'll cover the results of Markel Ventures segment, which, as a reminder, has its results reported on a 1 month lag. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $511 million for 2020 compared to $455 million last year, an increase of 12%. The increase in revenues was primarily related to the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019 and, to a lesser extent, an overall increase in our consumer and building products businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $67 million for 2020 compared to $55 million last year, an increase of 23%, reflecting improved operating results within one of our consumer and building products businesses and greater EBITDA within our transportation-related products businesses as well as the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was 21% for the first 3 months of 2020 and 2019. We reported a net loss to shareholders of $1.4 billion for 2020 compared to net income to shareholders of $576 million a year ago. Driven by the net loss, comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first quarter was also $1.4 billion compared to comprehensive income of $732 million in 2019. And finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $66 million in 2020 compared to $19 million for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. The increase also reflects the effects of lower claims settlement activity in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Partially offsetting strong cash flow activity in the first quarter was an adverse impact to cash flows for the return of collateral held for unearned premiums on a large program within our program services business that was canceled in the period. Invested assets at the holding company were $3.3 billion at the end of March compared to $4 billion at the end of the year. The decrease in holding company invested assets was due to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, again arising from COVID-19 impacts. Recognizing the importance of liquidity in times of uncertainty, we've taken several actions, including retaining cash proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and fixed maturities, pausing our purchases of equity securities and in certain instances selling equity holdings, suspending repurchases of our shares and focusing on expense reductions across the company. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality investment-grade securities with an average rating of AA. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of March was 27%, in line with our target range. We have no unsecured senior debt maturing in the next 24 months. We believe we are well positioned to meet our ongoing capital and liquidity needs, including the cash required to complete our pending acquisition of Lansing Building Products. Total shareholders' equity stood at $9.7 billion at the end of March compared to $11.1 billion at December 31. So in summary, the unprecedented events surrounding COVID-19 certainly impacted our quarterly results. However, the actions we've taken over the years to build a diverse and resilient organization will help us navigate through the current uncertainty arising from this pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichard Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning to everyone. First, please let me add my thanks as well to all the first responders and the essential workers. Since 1930, Markel has earned a reputation of being there for its clients, partners and communities during good times and bad. This crisis is no different. As the situation has unfolded, thousands of Markel associates have done an outstanding job, providing exceptional service to our customers. Our associates continue to exhibit the Markel style of flexibility, spontaneity, innovation and the pursuit of excellence as we all navigate this incredibly unique situation. Now I'd like to give you an update on the current impact and potential future impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our insurance, reinsurance, program services and ILS operations. Collectively, these are our insurance businesses. As long time followers of Markel will know, we adhere to a consistent reserving methodology that is laid out in our 10-K. Inherent in our reserving practices is the desire to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. While we are consistently implementing in our process as we analyze the COVID-19 situation, we cannot be certain that our estimates will prove to be more likely redundant than deficient. There are simply too many unknowns at this time given the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the event. Having completed our initial ground up review of each of our product lines and specific policy language, we have included management's best estimate of our ultimate direct COVID-19 insurance losses in our first quarter results. As we observe other insurance - insurer's reporting results, it is clear that a variety of approaches are being taken, with some companies planning to more fully reflect their COVID-19 exposures in the second quarter. So let's kick off talking about revenues. We started the year with substantial growth in the first 2.5 months, continuing the momentum we had seen for the past several quarters. That quickly changed as much of the U.S. and world economies rapidly closed. We have seen a drop-off in new business submissions over the past 6 weeks within our insurance operation, leaving our written premiums during that time roughly flat to the prior year. Over the same period of time, our renewal business is holding up very well. This is obviously a small sample size, and we do not believe the full impact of the COVID-19 situation and shutdown is fully reflected yet. As one would expect, our small business has been hardest hit by the shutdown. We would expect premium volume to pick up as economies start to reopen, but believe it would be overly optimistic to predict a near- to medium-term return to the growth rates we saw at the beginning of the year. While our program services businesses generate fee income, that fee income is calculated based on premium volume written in the insurance programs we support. We would expect to see a short to medium-term dip in fee income and then recovery as the U.S. economy reopens. Regarding insurance pricing, while there is reduced demand in the short to medium term, recent events only provide more evidence that rates need to increase to align with the exposures the industry insures. We are obtaining and will continue to push for rate increases and believe that our peers will as well. And we continue to see month-over-month increases in rates through the end of March. We don't have our April data yet. We are seeing an increase in demand for reinsurance. Insurers capital has been reduced as a result of the fallout from the pandemic, and more importantly, risk appetite has reduced. Reinsurance, of course, is a form of capital and a way to derisk for primary insurance companies. We expect increased pricing and demand for the foreseeable future in reinsurance. Our ILS operations provide a low correlation investment class to sophisticated investors. In the short run, given market disruptions, we would not expect to obtain significant new investment subscriptions. However, over the longer term, we believe current events once again validate the benefit of ILS investments. Also, as I previously discussed, we see an attractive rate environment in insurance and reinsurance which our ILS operations can take advantage of. Switching to losses. As discussed in our 10-Q and previously on this call by Jeremy, we recorded $325 million of reserves, virtually all of it IBNR, for direct COVID-19 insured losses in the first quarter. These reserves relate primarily to potential U.K. business interruption claims and worldwide event cancellation exposures. On the workers' compensation front, while we have received very few claims so far, we also expect to see an increase in claims that are directly related to COVID-19. It is worth noting that all of our U.S. property policies require a physical damage to occur before business interruption coverage is triggered, and almost all of those policies also include a communicable disease or virus exclusion. Here, I'll stop and just say some of our policies have affirmative coverage, often sub limited, that would cover the events of COVID-19 and those are included - our reserve estimates for those are included in our first quarter. Therefore, our U.S. property policies are not expected to respond to COVID-19-related business interruption losses, although we will be investigating each claim on its own merit. Our reserves were based on a ground-up analysis, but we're also informed by very preliminary industry estimates that suggest, over time, COVID-19 could produce anywhere from a $50 billion to $100 billion insurance industry loss event. We would also expect to see meaningful losses indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the disruption in the global economy and financial markets. These could include lines such as D&O, E&O, workers' compensation, trade credit, surety and casualty losses and the possibility of these types of losses impacting reinsurance business that we write. Similar to the losses that emerged as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, we would expect these losses to - these indirect losses to emerge over the coming quarters. Our underwriters, actuaries and claims personnels will be working to quantify the increases to our loss ratios potentially required by these indirect losses. Finally, we are prepared for elevated litigation expenses as it relates to COVID-19, particularly as it relates to business interruption claims in both the U.S. and abroad. Where appropriate, we are taking steps to mitigate future exposure to pandemic losses by raising prices and adding policy terms and conditions, including additional exclusions. There could be insurance lines where underwriting loss trends decrease and partially offset the impact of COVID-19 direct and indirect losses. An obvious example of this is private passenger auto, where our participation is small other than through our relationship with Hagerty and their classic car program. However, it is too early to speculate which lines, if any other than auto, could have their attritional loss ratios favorably impacted and by how much. In addition, we have already seen regulatory pressure to provide rebates in some of these areas. So in summary, while it is early and there are many unknowns, we believe the impact of COVID-19 to our insurance businesses is meaningful but also are manageable. We have a diverse insurance business portfolio, both by geography and product line, and solid liquidity and capital position. We look forward to continuing to serve our insureds and production partners, especially as the world's economies begin to reopen. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Tom.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Richie. During the first quarter of 2020, our overall investment portfolio declined 7%. Our equity portfolio declined 22.4%. This is the biggest quarterly decline since 2008, '09. Our fixed income portfolio rose 1.9% during the quarter as overall interest rates continued to decline. After adjusting for foreign currency movements and investment expenses, the total return was a negative 7%. Over the years, we've allocated a meaningful portion of our equity capital to our portfolio of equity securities. Over 30 years, that level of allocation has ranged from approximately 50% to 80%. The level depended on our views and comparisons of investment opportunities, insurance underwriting opportunities, acquisitions and other business alternatives. As I mentioned in my introductory comments, we started the year at 69% and ended the first quarter at 58% from a combination of modest sales as well as the overall market decline. We continue to select our equity holdings by following our long-standing discipline of looking for good businesses with good returns on capital and limited debt, run by management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity, with capital discipline and reinvestment opportunities at fair prices. That discipline does not change. In the current environment and the circumstances we expect for the foreseeable future, we believe that some previously good businesses may be challenged to earn reasonable returns on capital going forward. With this thought in mind, we continue to comb over each and every security we own. We continue to reexamine each holding in light of what has happened and, more importantly, changes that we would expect to persist for some duration. As we do so, we've adjusted our views on the profitability and outlook for some companies and acted accordingly. We expect that the sum of those actions should serve to both improve our balance sheet and future returns. That same discipline applies to our fixed income operations. Our focus has been and continues to be on the highest-rated sectors of the fixed income market. Our portfolio is roughly 89% in various government-backed securities and 93% rated AA or better. In our ventures operations, the year started well. As Jeremy reported, our diversified set of businesses produced revenues of $511 million compared to $455 million and EBITDA of $67 million compared to $55 million a year ago. Those results are reported with 1-month lag and do not yet include our acquisition of Lansing Building Products. The Lansing transaction, signed in the early days of March, was the culmination of a complicated multi-month process that involved 2 steps. We acquired Lansing from certain members of the Lansing family. And Lansing acquired Harvey Buildings distribution products in conjunction with this transaction. Lansing is a successful third-generation company based in Richmond. We've known and admired the Lansing family and their organization for years. Both Lansing and Harvey distribute building products for both new construction and repair and maintenance needs. Hunter Lansing will retain the vast majority of his equity stake in the combined firm and will serve as the CEO of the combined Lansing and Harvey businesses going forward. We are pleased to welcome Hunter and the Lansing organization to Markel, along with the Harvey organization. Their proven financial performance and long-term values and culture are consistent with all that we seek at Markel. Clearly, economic circumstances changed since we began the acquisition process. That said, Lansing has operated successfully during previously - previous challenging economic circumstances. They enjoy a large presence in the more stable repair and remodeling segment alongside their offerings related to new construction. And we believe they will be meaningful long-term contributors to our results over time. We are not engaged in any other discussions on ventures acquisitions at this time. Turning to the balance of our ventures operations. The COVID-19 economic shutdown taking place causes current conditions to be different than what was the case in the first quarter. We are responding accordingly and working diligently to operate the businesses in light of new business realities. We continue to operate our Markel Ventures businesses to meet our customers' needs for necessary and desirable products and services. The companies of Markel Ventures do things as basic as making the equipment to bake bread and process food, to make components for trailers used by trucking companies to transport the goods needed for daily life, to provide housing and shelter, to protect against fire, to provide healthcare and many other essential goods and services. We are proud of the work of all of our insurance, investment and ventures companies and what they do to provide for our customers and our associates. To close, a good friend of mine sent me a quote yesterday from former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. And that quote was, the best response to disaster is resilience. We embrace that idea and believe that our diversified operations add to the resiliency of the Markel Corporation. We now look forward to answering your questions. Sara, if you'd be so kind to open it up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Mark Hughes with SunTrust.\nThomas Gayner: Are you there, Mark?\nRichard Whitt: Why are you on mute?\nMark Hughes: Can you hear me?\nThomas Gayner: We can hear you now.\nMark Hughes: Okay, good. I'm sorry. In the international business interruption, how do you judge the remediation? When do we get back to normal? And what sort of limits are there on those policies?\nRichard Whitt: Okay, Mark, I'll attempt that one. Most of our policies exclude business interruption as a result of communicable disease viruses. And all of our policies require physical damage. So it's sort of a belt and suspenders approach. First and foremost, requires physical damage and then, in a lot of cases, we have virus exclusions. Virus exclusions are not prevalent in the U.K. market. And so our policies did not include those virus exclusions. We have gone through our portfolio of business there. It tends to be small to medium enterprise business in the U.K. and looked at the wording, there are various wordings. And again, they are different from our U.S. wordings. And where we believe there is affirmative coverage, we have made an estimate of the losses that could potentially be there. And obviously, we're having to make a lot of assumptions in terms of what's the duration of the business shutdown? Are they completely shut down? Are they partially shut down? So there's a number of factors that we've put in there. In our typical fashion, as I said in the beginning, we've tried to be more likely redundant than deficient. But there, as I said, there's a lot of assumptions and a lot of unknowns at this point. In terms of the go forward, when - things getting back to normal, my assumption is going forward, there's probably going to be less grants of coverage related to communicable disease and viruses in the international markets, more like the U.S. markets. But that's as we go forward.\nMark Hughes: And then it looks like you're reinsuring exposure there for business interruption, there is the $15 million provision in the U.S. I think you said that in the U.S., there are certain policies that have sub limits. You had bigger exposure on the reinsurance side as opposed to the direct side. Could you talk about what that is?\nRichard Whitt: It's very difficult at this point to estimate reinsurance exposures because the primary companies are still grappling with what their exposures are. And obviously, we would hear from them once they have a handle on that. But we have identified some business interruption - some potential business interruption that we could potentially cover on the reinsurance side, some accident and health exposures that we could potentially cover. And that's what we have tried to make an estimate of on the reinsurance side.\nMark Hughes: And then the program business. The - you referred to 2 large customers. How much does that impact your revenue on a go-forward basis?\nRichard Whitt: One of them was a customer that had - and we knew - we have known about this for quite a while, they received an upgrade to their rating and no longer required State National services. So we had budgeted for the gradual reduction of that business over the last 1.5 years, actually. So that was sort of planned into it and into our budgets and everything. So I would say minimal impact in terms of our first quarter results. The other one was a program that ended, and it ended on a canceled rewrite basis, which is where you return the unearned premium. And so that had a negative impact of about $55 million of premium in the quarter that was returned. And we think that will have a $2 million to $3 million impact going forward on fee income for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Stefano: Yes. Maybe I'm parsing words too finally but it feels like there is a segment of the business interruption claim, where there was no specific pandemic exclusion but that a reserve was established? I was just trying to understand, I think the concern is the extent to which there is the absence of a virus exclusion, the extent to which that can translate to maybe unintended or unanticipated losses just given the environment. Can you help us think about - is that true that there's reserves in that scenario? And how are you thinking about the potential for losses in that kind of situation?\nRichard Whitt: Sure. Happy to. So in the U.S. - let's take it in the pieces. Let's take it in the U.S. and primarily the U.K. would be the other bucket. In the U.S., we have a belt and suspenders approach, where all of our policies require physical damage, which COVID-19 is not physical damage. In addition, on the great majority of those policies, we have virus or communicable disease exclusions. And that is not something new, by the way, that - those exclusions have been going on those policies since 2007. So that's over a decade that, that has been in those policies. In some cases, we granted coverage or there is affirmative coverage, it's usually sub limited, usually about $25,000. So we have added up those policies and made an estimate for the losses that we could see from those. There is another subset of policies where we have affirmative coverage in the U.S. often in like the hospitality industry. And we have assessed those policies and put up reserves for what we think potential losses could be there. Switching. So we believe we've got losses up that are appropriate for those 2 subsets. And then on everything else, we have the belt and suspenders approach. In the U.K., it does require physical damage, but there has not historically been the use of virus or communicable disease exclusions. We have gone through our policies, reviewed the language, and where we believe there is some level of affirmative coverage that has been granted, of course subject to policy terms and conditions, we have made estimates for what we think that business interruption loss could look like. And we have kind of looked out into the future on how long do we think these businesses could be shut down and put that into our loss reserve.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it. Okay. So it seems like from the U.S. perspective, there's 2 scenarios. Do you think there is an explicit exclusio or there is a sub limit?\nRichard Whitt: Yes. Yes. I think that is fair. That is fair. There are some policies where it's not sub limit limited, but we've also looked at those limits, and based on whatever that limit is, we've estimated what the potential loss could be.\nPhilip Stefano: Understood. Okay. Were there any notable cats in the quarter? I didn't see any in the Q.\nRichard Whitt: Certainly, there were cats, there were tornadoes, hail, all those - all the usual things. It did not rise to a level that we felt required to break it out.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it. Okay. And I was hoping - you had commented on the ability to - the complications on the ILS side of the business with new investment, subscriptions. I mean - how does it feel with the launch of Lodgepine? I mean, is this largely on track? Have expectations around the timing or the size of the business been changed? Maybe you can just give us some thoughts on that.\nRichard Whitt: Sure. On the ILS side, the exposure to actual losses from COVID-19, we believe, is fairly minimal. But there's obviously been significant disruption in the broader financial markets. And whenever that happens, people tend to seek liquidity. And so our expectation - and we're still out there talking to potential investors, but we've sort of, in our own minds, are assuming that, that process could take longer as people deal with the uncertainty in the markets right now. So we still would hope to raise capital, both at Nephila and Lodgepine. But we're trying to be realistic in terms of what the situation is. And in our own minds thinking that could be a longer path to getting those additional subscriptions. At Nephila, we're at about $10 billion of assets under management. That's been pretty stable. We haven't seen a lot of redemptions, and we are working to see if we can add subscriptions. Lodgepine, timing for COVID-19 was not good to lodgepine. Just talking about that disruption, it's going to take longer to raise capital there. We have written the - most of the portfolio for Lodgepine for the year, and that's being warehoused on Markel Bermuda. So the portfolio is written and Markel is housing that portfolio on our balance sheet. And as we raise capital, we can seed some of that business to Lodgepine.\nPhilip Stefano: Got it. Okay. I got a few more, but I'll requeue. I just wanted to add a quick note. The level of detail that you broke out for the COVID thoughts and the potential losses is far more than we've seen from peers thus far. And I know I truly appreciate it. So thank you so much and look forward to discussing in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.\nRonald Bobman: Thanks for the help, given how early days we are on trying to get arms around exposures and losses. I had a question about sort of the ILS world, and in particular sort of collateralized re and the - sort of the implications for collateralized capital at - sort of contract expiration. Have you gotten any indications or thoughts from the teams there as far as the prospects for capital getting locked up given sort of the tail risk associated with BI?\nRichard Whitt: Yes. Ron, yes, we are thinking about those things. And there is a belief that cedents will look to trap more capital because of that tail risk that you discussed. So we are planning for that potential. I will say that there are provisions in the contracts that if you want to trap that capital, you have to put up a certain amount of reserves. So cedents will be required to put those reserves up in their financials to be able to trap capital in ILS. I can't just think or want to be really careful and hope that - they can't just tie up the capital without putting up a reserve. So they're going to have to feel like the exposure is known enough to record it to be able to trap capital. But we are considering that both at Nephila and Lodgepine and planning for it. And honestly, yes, I think there will be trapital - - capital trapped as a result of COVID-19. And that I think will continue to lead to more tightening in the reinsurance and collateralized reinsurance markets.\nRonald Bobman: You may have accidentally come across a new term right there.\nRichard Whitt: Yes.\nRonald Bobman: Hopefully, it's not - whatever, hopefully, it's not too common that we head that word. It's another topic. Obviously, the world is going through a dramatic economic shutdown contraction. And sadly, it's going to persist for some period of time. Hopefully, it alleviates, but it's going to suffer - we're going to suffer. In your core E&S business, obviously, all risk bearers are going to suffer that decline in the size of risk units and protection purchased. But on the flip side, you talked about rates going up, which will be a bit of an offset. But I would imagine that the admitted markets will - may reduce their appetite for sort of the gray area of risks that could migrate back to the E&S market. What do you think of sort of - will the positives of rate and declining admitted underwriting appetite exceed the economic contraction? Or is the economic contraction just sort of too great? And I'm talking about later this year and next year, sort of the pluses and the minuses. Which one do you think sort of rules the day?\nRichard Whitt: That's the million-dollar question, Ron. What we saw in April was a lot of the things you just said. We are seeing E&S pick up because I think there is a reduction in risk appetite out there as a result of all the disruption. So we've got certain areas of our book where rates are up substantially and our writings are up substantially. In April, that did offset the decreases we saw in small business and places that you would expect to be hit hard by COVID-19. I got to believe we haven't seen all of the impact from COVID-19 yet. Insurance business comes in on a tad - on a bit of a delay. So I think we'll see more of that in the second quarter, and that's the million-dollar question. How will those things offset each other? We're trying to plan for that in our businesses, and we're keeping an extremely close eye on it. But you're absolutely right, there's going to be positives, such as rate increase and decrease in risk appetite. But how will that float against just fact that less businesses seeking coverage on the primary side. On the reinsurance side, it's a hard market. Appetite is down, demand is up, and you're going to see more people looking for coverage and pricing going up accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeffrey Schmitt: The COVID-19 loss is $325 million. Just trying to make sure I understand that. It sounds like there really haven't been many claims, so it's mainly IBNR. But are those your estimates of business interruption, event cancellation for the year? Or should we be expecting this type of level of losses for the next couple of quarters?\nRichard Whitt: That is our best estimate of business interruption losses and event cancellation losses through the remainder of the year. Obviously, a lot of assumptions baked into that. But that is our best estimate. In terms of, for example, event cancellation, our event cancellation book goes from wedding cancellation to the Olympics and Wimbledon. So it is - it runs the gamut. And we have tried to look out for the rest of the year in terms of what we think the potential exposure could be, and we've tried to book that in the first quarter. The thing that is not represented here in this number is the secondary losses or the indirect losses. And that's things like the potential for D&O around bankruptcies or E&O for brokers. That we're going to be dealing with, just like after 2008, over the next several quarters.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Okay. Yes. And I guess, theoretically that could be fairly large. I mean, the workers' comp piece, that doesn't seem like - the other component outside of event cancellation business interruption was small. What's your expectation there just on the workers' comp means?\nRichard Whitt: Our workers' comp book is not weighted towards first responders. That's actually a very small part of our book. But obviously, we would expect claims there. When you get into essential workers, maybe like restaurants, retail, depending on how the rules work there, we've probably got a little more in that bucket. So we would expect to see claims. In addition, in workers' comp, you're going to see claims because of the change in the economy. Workers' comp claims go up when unemployment goes up. So we are - we're going to be trying to factor that into our picks as we go forward.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Okay. And then you had touched on Markel Ventures. But I guess, obviously, quite a few manufacturing businesses in there. I mean, what type of impact are you seeing now over the last few quarters, just on the top and bottom line? I mean, could there be a contraction in revenue growth there potentially?\nThomas Gayner: Yes. I don't think anything that we would report over the next quarter or 2 would surprise you given the nature of the economic shutdown. When the economy is shut down, it's shut down. But that being said, all of our businesses are operating, all of them are fulfilling orders and the operating business within the constraints that they have, obviously, following public health protocols and complying with every letter and spirit of the law plus the spirit of Markel to take care of our employees. But clearly, economic activity is diminished at the moment, and our businesses will reflect that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Fox with Fenimore.\nJohn Fox: I just had a couple of questions. Richie, I just want to add though, I thought your opening comments were very good and complete. And it's an uncertain situation, you gave us a lot of information, so I appreciate that. My question is, Richie, I wasn't totally clear. You talked about the losses which are basically all IBNR right now. You mentioned business interruption event. Are the workers - expected workers' comp losses in that $325 million number? Or is that an addition?\nRichard Whitt: I don't think - there's very little if any workers' comp in that number right now, John. I don't know that we had any claims in yet as we were establishing the number, but we would expect claims as we go forward in workers' comp. And so that's - this is a very strange event, and I don't have to say that. I mean, everybody knows that. But this is an ongoing event. Usually, you have a hurricane or something and it's over and you start adding up your exposure. But this one is ongoing. So there are people who will get sick, who have not gotten sick yet who will claim for workers' comp, and those losses will come in at that point.\nJohn Fox: Okay. So I just wanted to be clear whether there was any in the IBNR. For Tom. Tom, can you talk about on the fixed income side, your largest allocation is to muni bonds. There's a lot in the press about bailouts, no bailouts. All the states that we live in are under stress, financially, with the virus. So can you talk about how you're assessing the risk in your muni portfolio?\nThomas Gayner: Sure. Well, we're actually following the same sort of underwriting we always have. Munis, to review the bidding, are about 40% of the fixed income portfolio. Now we've always operated with position limits. So any given state can be no more than a certain percentage of the portfolio. And even within those purchased and portfolio limits, we don't just buy a state bond, there would be a spread of localities and jurisdictions within that state. Then the next layer of underwriting is typically we buy GO and essential services like water and sewer, we don't do stadium financing or any of that kind of stuff. So there's an epic spread that we've always kept in mind with the whole portfolio. So we're at the tippy top of everything we know how to do to be as pristine in credit quality as possible. Now the reports that you're speaking of, in terms of general municipal finance conditions, I've described those as being systemic. So it's not unique to Markel. And if you look at the presence of municipal finance within the entire structure, it's one of those things like Stein's Law, things that must be will and things that can't be won't. It is definitional to me that the structure of municipal finance has to work in order for the modern financial system to work. So as you see, the central bankers and the political leaders use the phrase whatever it takes. That is what is happening. And I believe that will continue to happen because it has to. And we're not going to speculate and be at the lower end of the curve or try to be too cute or too close to the line of what central banks will buy or won't buy. We'll be at the very tippy top of the spectrum.\nJohn Fox: Okay. And then let me ask a question that looks further out, it's probably too optimistic for a moment. But I would think with the 60 basis point, or whatever it is, 10-year treasury bond and the volatility of stock, ILS would be a phenomenal investment for the pension funds which need to earn 7% a year and not correlated to the stock market. So I mean, is this potentially down the road a real opportunity for ILS? Or is that too optimistic of a view given the environment?\nRichard Whitt: John, that's our view exactly. We recognize in the short to medium term, everything about the situation is negative on so many levels. But this just again proves why the ILS investment is valuable. It does - or it has very, very low correlation to the rest of the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle with RBC.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. I like the other comments, thank you for all the disclosure. It was very thorough and very mature. First question I wanted to ask is, it was commented in the opening remarks and it's in the Q that there was a $20 million charge within the investment income related to equity accounted investments. Can you just provide a little bit more detail about that and what the circumstances were that produced the charge?\nThomas Gayner: Sure. Mark, this is Tom. The way that works is there's a couple of firms that we seeded over the years in terms of giving them some money to manage. And normally, we got some economics of the firm itself overrides from doing so. Limited basis, but we've done a couple of that over the years. The way that - in that particular charge, I believe that we had given that firm $25 million a number of years ago. The value of the portfolio in and of itself has gone up over time. We've done some of the economics of the firm itself, but they had a rough first quarter. So all of the fair market decline that happened during the first quarter shows up as that specific chart. Now that being said, we're still profitable in that overall investment with that firm. It's just that the profits we have earned over this course of the last several years were never isolated and labeled individually, whereas the mark-to-market decline in the first quarter was. So we've made money on that investment over time, but that's what drove that to be the case.\nMark Dwelle: I see. Okay. That's helpful. Within the - again, within the Q, there was a comment about an increase in attritional losses within workers' comp and property in the insurance business. Can you just elaborate on what you're seeing there? And maybe what some of the drivers are, particularly on the workers' comp side?\nRichard Whitt: Hold on just one second. On reinsurance?\nMark Dwelle: I thought it was in the insurance segment, but maybe my notes are confused.\nRichard Whitt: Yes. Well, maybe I'll try a little more generally because we're struggling to find what that reference was in the Q. But it's interesting, Mark. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion on social inflation. And we certainly are seeing some signs of that in our numbers as well. It's probably, we're seeing a bit less of it on the insurance side than on the reinsurance side. It takes longer to get to reinsurance. So I think those comments would have been related to our reinsurance entity - our reinsurance business and would have been around some of our workers' compensation business there and some of our casualty professional business there. So we have seen the impact of social inflation on the reinsurance side. And we're seeing it some on the insurance side, but nowhere near as much. Also, interesting to us - and again very early days, our claim activity is down. Our attritional claim activity is down in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Only a couple of those weeks were impacted by the COVID-19 situation. So we're still assessing that. But that - hopefully, that helps you out a little bit.\nJeremy Noble: Mark, it's Jeremy. I would just add, it's more weighted towards property and workers' comp with regards to attritional. And actually, another part of our workers comp, a little bit of mix in the portfolio between where we're writing quota shares or excess to loss contracts, they can have slightly different attritionals there. So I wouldn't read too much into that comment with regards to that moving the attritional loss ratio from a reinsurance workers' comp standpoint.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. And then the last question that I had was you - and Rich, in your remarks, you alluded to the probability of higher litigation expense in defending your various contracts, particularly for BI, but probably for just about everything. Has that been reflected or that is being reflected in the loss picks that you selected in Q1? Or is that something that you're still awaiting development on before making that type of an adjustment?\nRichard Whitt: Yes. I would say it's more implicit than explicit in terms of the numbers that we have put up. But I mean, we very much - I mean - and here's the reality. I mean, the economics that are at stake, the economic damages that have been done by this situation are just so large. People have incentive to attempt to recover that even if their coverage was not granted. So we just simply expect, given the size of the economic damage, the political backdrop, the emotion involved, there's going to be more litigation. And so we are preparing for that. That is implicit to the numbers. As we go forward, it'll probably be more explicit to the numbers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is a follow-up from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhilip Stefano: Yes. I was hoping you could just help us think about how the rating agencies are viewing the debt ratios, especially in the context of tangible equity, current cash levels and maybe potentially the depressed outlook for earnings as we think about moving forward?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. It's Jeremy. I'm not going to speak to how the rating agency are maybe generally looking at it across the board. But certainly specific to Markel. I mean from a debt level standpoint and a 27% leverage ratio, that's well within our target range and certainly well within what the rating agencies are comfortable with. Won't come as a surprise. We certainly are in discussions and preview earnings in the release as we would typically for our quarter with significant events. So we've been speaking to each of the rating agencies. Because we have been acquisitive over time, you're right to point out that they will look at to varying degrees the level of goodwill and intangibles to shareholders' equity. But again, I would say while we're at the higher end of the range of kind of what they look at, there's a lot of qualitative considerations that go into that as well, when they look at the underlying business and the earnings and cash flow streams from those businesses. So nothing on that front, I think, right now, that's specifically of note.\nPhilip Stefano: Okay. And I noticed in the Q that there was a conversation around no goodwill or intangible impairment. Maybe you could just give us some thoughts about how that process works and businesses that feel as though they may be most susceptible to some form of impairment, just as we think about, particularly in the ventures business, maybe the impact of the economic environment moving forward.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Sure. Again, Jeremy. First off, I think you will have seen and observed, I mean, there's a lot of cautionary language that we put into the Q, and we're trying to be very clear of the things that could respond relative to the levels of uncertainty that exist. Specifically in the period, we have a meaningful amount of goodwill and that's because we've been acquisitive over the years. We looked at all of our reporting units and also, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value - or sorry, it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of our reporting units. Now we didn't feel like yet at the end of March that there was really kind of a triggering event. So we relied significantly on qualitative considerations and sensitivity analysis, looking at sort of the last time we had done valuations of the various reporting units. And we felt pretty comfortable at this stage. We flagged the fact that there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty. So the longer the economic shutdown goes on, the more impactful that is over a sustained period to our businesses. It's reasonable to think that there could be the possibility that those valuations would be called into question. That's something that we would be prepared at - we will be prepared to look at over time. I would say, in part, because we've conducted a number of acquisitions recently. I mean, those are some places that we'll look at very carefully, most carefully, because there's been less time since the point that we did the original valuations of those businesses. And there's quite a bit of disclosure in the Q that will lay out some of those key kind of considerations and assumptions in how we think about those accounting requirements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Hauff of Wells Fargo.\nRobert Hauff: Just to follow up on the goodwill and intangible question. I think I know the answer to this, but just looking for confirmation here. None of the goodwill or intangibles being reviewed are held as an admitted asset with the insurance companies?\nJeremy Noble: That's correct.\nRobert Hauff: Okay. Great. And then the Q also mentioned that the ventures businesses could look to potentially increase borrowings to help get through this period of time. We're certainly seeing that across the board within various other industries. Could you remind us again how much the insurance companies have loaned into the ventures business? Have those balances increased since the end of the quarter? And are there any sort of regulatory or internally mandated limits on how much the insurance companies can lend into these entities?\nThomas Gayner: Yes. I'll let Jeremy chime in. But basically, from the bottom-up point of view, the businesses themselves, they tend to operate with relatively low levels of debt. There's some of those companies that have no debt at all. They would have normal working capital lines with banks that they would work with, given the normal flows of their business. But part of the language in the Qs was just given the uncertainty and the array of credit options that were being placed out there in the marketplace, but it was appropriate to add the language that they might avail themselves to some of those things. As of yet, they have not.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. And the amount of debt with the insurance subs has not moved meaningfully since the end of the year. I think that number is actually sort of disclosed out in our footnotes in the 10-K. So I don't want to quote that figure right now. But - and then with regards to sort of limits in place, there are limits in place. And I have to say, both internally and then in conjunction with what we've agreed from sort of a state rule with regards to each of our domestic insurance companies. So there are limits to when that makes good sort of economic sense and complies to the regulatory requirement.\nRobert Hauff: That's helpful. And then last one for me, for Tom. Did you mention, Tom, how much has the mark on the equity portfolio changed since the end of the quarter?\nThomas Gayner: We've not put that number out, but obviously, so far in April, price has been going up.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Be well. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Richard Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning to everyone. First, please let me add my thanks as well to all the first responders and the essential workers. Since 1930, Markel has earned a reputation of being there for its clients, partners and communities during good times and bad. This crisis is no different. As the situation has unfolded, thousands of Markel associates have done an outstanding job, providing exceptional service to our customers. Our associates continue to exhibit the Markel style of flexibility, spontaneity, innovation and the pursuit of excellence as we all navigate this incredibly unique situation. Now I'd like to give you an update on the current impact and potential future impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our insurance, reinsurance, program services and ILS operations. Collectively, these are our insurance businesses. As long time followers of Markel will know, we adhere to a consistent reserving methodology that is laid out in our 10-K. Inherent in our reserving practices is the desire to establish loss reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. While we are consistently implementing in our process as we analyze the COVID-19 situation, we cannot be certain that our estimates will prove to be more likely redundant than deficient. There are simply too many unknowns at this time given the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the event. Having completed our initial ground up review of each of our product lines and specific policy language, we have included management's best estimate of our ultimate direct COVID-19 insurance losses in our first quarter results. As we observe other insurance - insurer's reporting results, it is clear that a variety of approaches are being taken, with some companies planning to more fully reflect their COVID-19 exposures in the second quarter. So let's kick off talking about revenues. We started the year with substantial growth in the first 2.5 months, continuing the momentum we had seen for the past several quarters. That quickly changed as much of the U.S. and world economies rapidly closed. We have seen a drop-off in new business submissions over the past 6 weeks within our insurance operation, leaving our written premiums during that time roughly flat to the prior year. Over the same period of time, our renewal business is holding up very well. This is obviously a small sample size, and we do not believe the full impact of the COVID-19 situation and shutdown is fully reflected yet. As one would expect, our small business has been hardest hit by the shutdown. We would expect premium volume to pick up as economies start to reopen, but believe it would be overly optimistic to predict a near- to medium-term return to the growth rates we saw at the beginning of the year. While our program services businesses generate fee income, that fee income is calculated based on premium volume written in the insurance programs we support. We would expect to see a short to medium-term dip in fee income and then recovery as the U.S. economy reopens. Regarding insurance pricing, while there is reduced demand in the short to medium term, recent events only provide more evidence that rates need to increase to align with the exposures the industry insures. We are obtaining and will continue to push for rate increases and believe that our peers will as well. And we continue to see month-over-month increases in rates through the end of March. We don't have our April data yet. We are seeing an increase in demand for reinsurance. Insurers capital has been reduced as a result of the fallout from the pandemic, and more importantly, risk appetite has reduced. Reinsurance, of course, is a form of capital and a way to derisk for primary insurance companies. We expect increased pricing and demand for the foreseeable future in reinsurance. Our ILS operations provide a low correlation investment class to sophisticated investors. In the short run, given market disruptions, we would not expect to obtain significant new investment subscriptions. However, over the longer term, we believe current events once again validate the benefit of ILS investments. Also, as I previously discussed, we see an attractive rate environment in insurance and reinsurance which our ILS operations can take advantage of. Switching to losses. As discussed in our 10-Q and previously on this call by Jeremy, we recorded $325 million of reserves, virtually all of it IBNR, for direct COVID-19 insured losses in the first quarter. These reserves relate primarily to potential U.K. business interruption claims and worldwide event cancellation exposures. On the workers' compensation front, while we have received very few claims so far, we also expect to see an increase in claims that are directly related to COVID-19. It is worth noting that all of our U.S. property policies require a physical damage to occur before business interruption coverage is triggered, and almost all of those policies also include a communicable disease or virus exclusion. Here, I'll stop and just say some of our policies have affirmative coverage, often sub limited, that would cover the events of COVID-19 and those are included - our reserve estimates for those are included in our first quarter. Therefore, our U.S. property policies are not expected to respond to COVID-19-related business interruption losses, although we will be investigating each claim on its own merit. Our reserves were based on a ground-up analysis, but we're also informed by very preliminary industry estimates that suggest, over time, COVID-19 could produce anywhere from a $50 billion to $100 billion insurance industry loss event. We would also expect to see meaningful losses indirectly related to the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the disruption in the global economy and financial markets. These could include lines such as D&O, E&O, workers' compensation, trade credit, surety and casualty losses and the possibility of these types of losses impacting reinsurance business that we write. Similar to the losses that emerged as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, we would expect these losses to - these indirect losses to emerge over the coming quarters. Our underwriters, actuaries and claims personnels will be working to quantify the increases to our loss ratios potentially required by these indirect losses. Finally, we are prepared for elevated litigation expenses as it relates to COVID-19, particularly as it relates to business interruption claims in both the U.S. and abroad. Where appropriate, we are taking steps to mitigate future exposure to pandemic losses by raising prices and adding policy terms and conditions, including additional exclusions. There could be insurance lines where underwriting loss trends decrease and partially offset the impact of COVID-19 direct and indirect losses. An obvious example of this is private passenger auto, where our participation is small other than through our relationship with Hagerty and their classic car program. However, it is too early to speculate which lines, if any other than auto, could have their attritional loss ratios favorably impacted and by how much. In addition, we have already seen regulatory pressure to provide rebates in some of these areas. So in summary, while it is early and there are many unknowns, we believe the impact of COVID-19 to our insurance businesses is meaningful but also are manageable. We have a diverse insurance business portfolio, both by geography and product line, and solid liquidity and capital position. We look forward to continuing to serve our insureds and production partners, especially as the world's economies begin to reopen. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Tom. Why are you on mute? Okay, Mark, I'll attempt that one. Most of our policies exclude business interruption as a result of communicable disease viruses. And all of our policies require physical damage. So it's sort of a belt and suspenders approach. First and foremost, requires physical damage and then, in a lot of cases, we have virus exclusions. Virus exclusions are not prevalent in the U.K. market. And so our policies did not include those virus exclusions. We have gone through our portfolio of business there. It tends to be small to medium enterprise business in the U.K. and looked at the wording, there are various wordings. And again, they are different from our U.S. wordings. And where we believe there is affirmative coverage, we have made an estimate of the losses that could potentially be there. And obviously, we're having to make a lot of assumptions in terms of what's the duration of the business shutdown? Are they completely shut down? Are they partially shut down? So there's a number of factors that we've put in there. In our typical fashion, as I said in the beginning, we've tried to be more likely redundant than deficient. But there, as I said, there's a lot of assumptions and a lot of unknowns at this point. In terms of the go forward, when - things getting back to normal, my assumption is going forward, there's probably going to be less grants of coverage related to communicable disease and viruses in the international markets, more like the U.S. markets. But that's as we go forward. It's very difficult at this point to estimate reinsurance exposures because the primary companies are still grappling with what their exposures are. And obviously, we would hear from them once they have a handle on that. But we have identified some business interruption - some potential business interruption that we could potentially cover on the reinsurance side, some accident and health exposures that we could potentially cover. And that's what we have tried to make an estimate of on the reinsurance side. One of them was a customer that had - and we knew - we have known about this for quite a while, they received an upgrade to their rating and no longer required State National services. So we had budgeted for the gradual reduction of that business over the last 1.5 years, actually. So that was sort of planned into it and into our budgets and everything. So I would say minimal impact in terms of our first quarter results. The other one was a program that ended, and it ended on a canceled rewrite basis, which is where you return the unearned premium. And so that had a negative impact of about $55 million of premium in the quarter that was returned. And we think that will have a $2 million to $3 million impact going forward on fee income for the rest of the year. Sure. Happy to. So in the U.S. - let's take it in the pieces. Let's take it in the U.S. and primarily the U.K. would be the other bucket. In the U.S., we have a belt and suspenders approach, where all of our policies require physical damage, which COVID-19 is not physical damage. In addition, on the great majority of those policies, we have virus or communicable disease exclusions. And that is not something new, by the way, that - those exclusions have been going on those policies since 2007. So that's over a decade that, that has been in those policies. In some cases, we granted coverage or there is affirmative coverage, it's usually sub limited, usually about $25,000. So we have added up those policies and made an estimate for the losses that we could see from those. There is another subset of policies where we have affirmative coverage in the U.S. often in like the hospitality industry. And we have assessed those policies and put up reserves for what we think potential losses could be there. Switching. So we believe we've got losses up that are appropriate for those 2 subsets. And then on everything else, we have the belt and suspenders approach. In the U.K., it does require physical damage, but there has not historically been the use of virus or communicable disease exclusions. We have gone through our policies, reviewed the language, and where we believe there is some level of affirmative coverage that has been granted, of course subject to policy terms and conditions, we have made estimates for what we think that business interruption loss could look like. And we have kind of looked out into the future on how long do we think these businesses could be shut down and put that into our loss reserve. Yes. Yes. I think that is fair. That is fair. There are some policies where it's not sub limit limited, but we've also looked at those limits, and based on whatever that limit is, we've estimated what the potential loss could be. Certainly, there were cats, there were tornadoes, hail, all those - all the usual things. It did not rise to a level that we felt required to break it out. Sure. On the ILS side, the exposure to actual losses from COVID-19, we believe, is fairly minimal. But there's obviously been significant disruption in the broader financial markets. And whenever that happens, people tend to seek liquidity. And so our expectation - and we're still out there talking to potential investors, but we've sort of, in our own minds, are assuming that, that process could take longer as people deal with the uncertainty in the markets right now. So we still would hope to raise capital, both at Nephila and Lodgepine. But we're trying to be realistic in terms of what the situation is. And in our own minds thinking that could be a longer path to getting those additional subscriptions. At Nephila, we're at about $10 billion of assets under management. That's been pretty stable. We haven't seen a lot of redemptions, and we are working to see if we can add subscriptions. Lodgepine, timing for COVID-19 was not good to lodgepine. Just talking about that disruption, it's going to take longer to raise capital there. We have written the - most of the portfolio for Lodgepine for the year, and that's being warehoused on Markel Bermuda. So the portfolio is written and Markel is housing that portfolio on our balance sheet. And as we raise capital, we can seed some of that business to Lodgepine. Yes. Ron, yes, we are thinking about those things. And there is a belief that cedents will look to trap more capital because of that tail risk that you discussed. So we are planning for that potential. I will say that there are provisions in the contracts that if you want to trap that capital, you have to put up a certain amount of reserves. So cedents will be required to put those reserves up in their financials to be able to trap capital in ILS. I can't just think or want to be really careful and hope that - they can't just tie up the capital without putting up a reserve. So they're going to have to feel like the exposure is known enough to record it to be able to trap capital. But we are considering that both at Nephila and Lodgepine and planning for it. And honestly, yes, I think there will be trapital - - capital trapped as a result of COVID-19. And that I think will continue to lead to more tightening in the reinsurance and collateralized reinsurance markets. Yes. That's the million-dollar question, Ron. What we saw in April was a lot of the things you just said. We are seeing E&S pick up because I think there is a reduction in risk appetite out there as a result of all the disruption. So we've got certain areas of our book where rates are up substantially and our writings are up substantially. In April, that did offset the decreases we saw in small business and places that you would expect to be hit hard by COVID-19. I got to believe we haven't seen all of the impact from COVID-19 yet. Insurance business comes in on a tad - on a bit of a delay. So I think we'll see more of that in the second quarter, and that's the million-dollar question. How will those things offset each other? We're trying to plan for that in our businesses, and we're keeping an extremely close eye on it. But you're absolutely right, there's going to be positives, such as rate increase and decrease in risk appetite. But how will that float against just fact that less businesses seeking coverage on the primary side. On the reinsurance side, it's a hard market. Appetite is down, demand is up, and you're going to see more people looking for coverage and pricing going up accordingly. That is our best estimate of business interruption losses and event cancellation losses through the remainder of the year. Obviously, a lot of assumptions baked into that. But that is our best estimate. In terms of, for example, event cancellation, our event cancellation book goes from wedding cancellation to the Olympics and Wimbledon. So it is - it runs the gamut. And we have tried to look out for the rest of the year in terms of what we think the potential exposure could be, and we've tried to book that in the first quarter. The thing that is not represented here in this number is the secondary losses or the indirect losses. And that's things like the potential for D&O around bankruptcies or E&O for brokers. That we're going to be dealing with, just like after 2008, over the next several quarters. Our workers' comp book is not weighted towards first responders. That's actually a very small part of our book. But obviously, we would expect claims there. When you get into essential workers, maybe like restaurants, retail, depending on how the rules work there, we've probably got a little more in that bucket. So we would expect to see claims. In addition, in workers' comp, you're going to see claims because of the change in the economy. Workers' comp claims go up when unemployment goes up. So we are - we're going to be trying to factor that into our picks as we go forward. I don't think - there's very little if any workers' comp in that number right now, John. I don't know that we had any claims in yet as we were establishing the number, but we would expect claims as we go forward in workers' comp. And so that's - this is a very strange event, and I don't have to say that. I mean, everybody knows that. But this is an ongoing event. Usually, you have a hurricane or something and it's over and you start adding up your exposure. But this one is ongoing. So there are people who will get sick, who have not gotten sick yet who will claim for workers' comp, and those losses will come in at that point. John, that's our view exactly. We recognize in the short to medium term, everything about the situation is negative on so many levels. But this just again proves why the ILS investment is valuable. It does - or it has very, very low correlation to the rest of the market. Hold on just one second. On reinsurance? Yes. Well, maybe I'll try a little more generally because we're struggling to find what that reference was in the Q. But it's interesting, Mark. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion on social inflation. And we certainly are seeing some signs of that in our numbers as well. It's probably, we're seeing a bit less of it on the insurance side than on the reinsurance side. It takes longer to get to reinsurance. So I think those comments would have been related to our reinsurance entity - our reinsurance business and would have been around some of our workers' compensation business there and some of our casualty professional business there. So we have seen the impact of social inflation on the reinsurance side. And we're seeing it some on the insurance side, but nowhere near as much. Also, interesting to us - and again very early days, our claim activity is down. Our attritional claim activity is down in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019. Only a couple of those weeks were impacted by the COVID-19 situation. So we're still assessing that. But that - hopefully, that helps you out a little bit. Yes. I would say it's more implicit than explicit in terms of the numbers that we have put up. But I mean, we very much - I mean - and here's the reality. I mean, the economics that are at stake, the economic damages that have been done by this situation are just so large. People have incentive to attempt to recover that even if their coverage was not granted. So we just simply expect, given the size of the economic damage, the political backdrop, the emotion involved, there's going to be more litigation. And so we are preparing for that. That is implicit to the numbers. As we go forward, it'll probably be more explicit to the numbers."

            "name": "Thomas Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, and welcome to the Markel Corporation First Quarter Conference Call. My name is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined today by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. While the nature of this call is financial, I want to start by thanking the people on the front lines. I want to thank the people who are manning our hospitals, our grocery stores, our utilities and countless other essential elements of our lives. I want to thank those that may not be in the headlines but do keep supply chains working. In many cases, the people of Markel provide many of the essential products and services I speak of, and I want to take this opportunity to thank them for doing so. At the beginning of the year, we started with excellent operational momentum in our diversified insurance, investment and ventures operations. We entered the year with a conservative balance sheet, marked by high-quality fixed income holdings, no near-term debt maturities and a publicly traded equity portfolio that stood at 69% of shareholders' equity. Those equity securities had a cost basis of $3.3 billion and a market capitalization of $7.6 billion at that time. In mid-March, conditions changed suddenly and dramatically. COVID-19-driven shutdowns of the economy started to take place. Since that time, COVID-19 has come to dominate just about every aspect of life, and Markel is no exception. Our focus has been and will continue to be on building Markel over the long term. That said, current conditions must be addressed. We're making daily and continuous decisions as we navigate through this historic time, and we'll do our best to keep you informed of our progress as we do so. During today's call, Jeremy will update you on our numbers. Richie will discuss conditions in our insurance operations. Then I will return with comments about our investments and ventures operations. Following our brief comments, we will attempt to answer your questions. With that, Jeremy? Thank you, Richie. During the first quarter of 2020, our overall investment portfolio declined 7%. Our equity portfolio declined 22.4%. This is the biggest quarterly decline since 2008, '09. Our fixed income portfolio rose 1.9% during the quarter as overall interest rates continued to decline. After adjusting for foreign currency movements and investment expenses, the total return was a negative 7%. Over the years, we've allocated a meaningful portion of our equity capital to our portfolio of equity securities. Over 30 years, that level of allocation has ranged from approximately 50% to 80%. The level depended on our views and comparisons of investment opportunities, insurance underwriting opportunities, acquisitions and other business alternatives. As I mentioned in my introductory comments, we started the year at 69% and ended the first quarter at 58% from a combination of modest sales as well as the overall market decline. We continue to select our equity holdings by following our long-standing discipline of looking for good businesses with good returns on capital and limited debt, run by management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity, with capital discipline and reinvestment opportunities at fair prices. That discipline does not change. In the current environment and the circumstances we expect for the foreseeable future, we believe that some previously good businesses may be challenged to earn reasonable returns on capital going forward. With this thought in mind, we continue to comb over each and every security we own. We continue to reexamine each holding in light of what has happened and, more importantly, changes that we would expect to persist for some duration. As we do so, we've adjusted our views on the profitability and outlook for some companies and acted accordingly. We expect that the sum of those actions should serve to both improve our balance sheet and future returns. That same discipline applies to our fixed income operations. Our focus has been and continues to be on the highest-rated sectors of the fixed income market. Our portfolio is roughly 89% in various government-backed securities and 93% rated AA or better. In our ventures operations, the year started well. As Jeremy reported, our diversified set of businesses produced revenues of $511 million compared to $455 million and EBITDA of $67 million compared to $55 million a year ago. Those results are reported with 1-month lag and do not yet include our acquisition of Lansing Building Products. The Lansing transaction, signed in the early days of March, was the culmination of a complicated multi-month process that involved 2 steps. We acquired Lansing from certain members of the Lansing family. And Lansing acquired Harvey Buildings distribution products in conjunction with this transaction. Lansing is a successful third-generation company based in Richmond. We've known and admired the Lansing family and their organization for years. Both Lansing and Harvey distribute building products for both new construction and repair and maintenance needs. Hunter Lansing will retain the vast majority of his equity stake in the combined firm and will serve as the CEO of the combined Lansing and Harvey businesses going forward. We are pleased to welcome Hunter and the Lansing organization to Markel, along with the Harvey organization. Their proven financial performance and long-term values and culture are consistent with all that we seek at Markel. Clearly, economic circumstances changed since we began the acquisition process. That said, Lansing has operated successfully during previously - previous challenging economic circumstances. They enjoy a large presence in the more stable repair and remodeling segment alongside their offerings related to new construction. And we believe they will be meaningful long-term contributors to our results over time. We are not engaged in any other discussions on ventures acquisitions at this time. Turning to the balance of our ventures operations. The COVID-19 economic shutdown taking place causes current conditions to be different than what was the case in the first quarter. We are responding accordingly and working diligently to operate the businesses in light of new business realities. We continue to operate our Markel Ventures businesses to meet our customers' needs for necessary and desirable products and services. The companies of Markel Ventures do things as basic as making the equipment to bake bread and process food, to make components for trailers used by trucking companies to transport the goods needed for daily life, to provide housing and shelter, to protect against fire, to provide healthcare and many other essential goods and services. We are proud of the work of all of our insurance, investment and ventures companies and what they do to provide for our customers and our associates. To close, a good friend of mine sent me a quote yesterday from former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. And that quote was, the best response to disaster is resilience. We embrace that idea and believe that our diversified operations add to the resiliency of the Markel Corporation. We now look forward to answering your questions. Sara, if you'd be so kind to open it up. Are you there, Mark? We can hear you now. Yes. I don't think anything that we would report over the next quarter or 2 would surprise you given the nature of the economic shutdown. When the economy is shut down, it's shut down. But that being said, all of our businesses are operating, all of them are fulfilling orders and the operating business within the constraints that they have, obviously, following public health protocols and complying with every letter and spirit of the law plus the spirit of Markel to take care of our employees. But clearly, economic activity is diminished at the moment, and our businesses will reflect that. Sure. Well, we're actually following the same sort of underwriting we always have. Munis, to review the bidding, are about 40% of the fixed income portfolio. Now we've always operated with position limits. So any given state can be no more than a certain percentage of the portfolio. And even within those purchased and portfolio limits, we don't just buy a state bond, there would be a spread of localities and jurisdictions within that state. Then the next layer of underwriting is typically we buy GO and essential services like water and sewer, we don't do stadium financing or any of that kind of stuff. So there's an epic spread that we've always kept in mind with the whole portfolio. So we're at the tippy top of everything we know how to do to be as pristine in credit quality as possible. Now the reports that you're speaking of, in terms of general municipal finance conditions, I've described those as being systemic. So it's not unique to Markel. And if you look at the presence of municipal finance within the entire structure, it's one of those things like Stein's Law, things that must be will and things that can't be won't. It is definitional to me that the structure of municipal finance has to work in order for the modern financial system to work. So as you see, the central bankers and the political leaders use the phrase whatever it takes. That is what is happening. And I believe that will continue to happen because it has to. And we're not going to speculate and be at the lower end of the curve or try to be too cute or too close to the line of what central banks will buy or won't buy. We'll be at the very tippy top of the spectrum. Sure. Mark, this is Tom. The way that works is there's a couple of firms that we seeded over the years in terms of giving them some money to manage. And normally, we got some economics of the firm itself overrides from doing so. Limited basis, but we've done a couple of that over the years. The way that - in that particular charge, I believe that we had given that firm $25 million a number of years ago. The value of the portfolio in and of itself has gone up over time. We've done some of the economics of the firm itself, but they had a rough first quarter. So all of the fair market decline that happened during the first quarter shows up as that specific chart. Now that being said, we're still profitable in that overall investment with that firm. It's just that the profits we have earned over this course of the last several years were never isolated and labeled individually, whereas the mark-to-market decline in the first quarter was. So we've made money on that investment over time, but that's what drove that to be the case. Yes. I'll let Jeremy chime in. But basically, from the bottom-up point of view, the businesses themselves, they tend to operate with relatively low levels of debt. There's some of those companies that have no debt at all. They would have normal working capital lines with banks that they would work with, given the normal flows of their business. But part of the language in the Qs was just given the uncertainty and the array of credit options that were being placed out there in the marketplace, but it was appropriate to add the language that they might avail themselves to some of those things. As of yet, they have not. We've not put that number out, but obviously, so far in April, price has been going up. Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to connecting with you next quarter. Be well. Thank you."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment and echo Tom's sentiments of thanks and appreciation, first to medical professionals, frontline workers and public servants who are courageously and tirelessly taking care of our communities. I'm equally grateful to our employees around the globe. I've been impressed at how they are taking care of their families, customers, distribution partners and each other during these unprecedented times. So again, thank you. As you heard from Tom and saw in our earnings announcement, our consolidated quarterly performance was heavily influenced by COVID-19 and the adverse impact it had on both the assets and liabilities sides of our balance sheet, the effects which can be seen in the results of our insurance and investment engines. Looking at our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $1.9 billion for the quarter compared to $1.7 billion in 2019, an increase of 13%. This increase is almost entirely due to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $1.4 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the 2019 period. This growth is related primarily to increased writings within our professional liability and general liability product lines. Gross written premiums within our reinsurance segment were consistent with the 2019 period at just over $500 million. Retention of gross written premiums decreased to 85% from 87% in 2019, driven by lower retention within our reinsurance segment, resulting from purchases of additional outwards protection on our property product line as we seek to effectively manage capital and reduce volatility around catastrophe exposures. Earned premiums increased 11% to $1.3 billion in 2020 due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2020 was 118% compared to 95% in 2019. Here's where we begin to see the effects of COVID-19 on the liability side of our balance sheet. During the quarter, we recognized our best estimate of pretax net losses and loss adjustment expenses of $325 million for COVID-19. These COVID-19 losses increased our consolidated combined ratio by 24 points. So if you do the simple math, the consolidated combined ratio prior to the effects of COVID-19 was 94%. These reserves were established after detailed policy level reviews as well as a review of our in-force inwards and outwards reinsurance contracts. In those instances where we identified COVID-19 has the proximate cause of loss, we established loss reserves in the first quarter of 2020. Our losses from COVID-19 are primarily attributed to the business written within our international insurance operations and are primarily associated with coverages for event cancellation and business interruption losses and policies where no specific pandemic exclusions exist. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with our assumptions around COVID-19 which, among other things, include assumptions related to coverages, liability, reinsurance protection, duration and loss mitigation factors as well as the fact that the economic impacts of the pandemic continue to evolve, our estimates may be subject to a wide range of variability. Excluding the effects of COVID-19, our current accident year loss ratio was higher year-over-year due to slightly higher attritional loss ratios in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. We have yet to reflect meaningful benefit from rate increases we've been achieving. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, consistent with our loss reserving philosophy, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $104 million in the current quarter compared to favorable prior year development of $70 million in the first 3 months of 2019. Next, I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations, both of which are included in results of operations - sorry, results of other operations. Our gross written premium volume from our State National program services operations was down 28% to prior year, driven by the runoff of 1 large program and the cancellation of an in-force book of policies related to another large program, which resulted in the onetime unfavorable premium adjustment. As a reminder, almost all of this gross written premium is ceded. Ceding fee revenues were up 4% from last year due to growth in the program premium volumes during 2019. Turning quickly to our ILS operations. Our combined ILS operations have roughly $12.5 billion of net assets under management at the end of March 2020. Our Markel CATCo operations are continuing to wind down as they work to return investor capital as quickly and efficiently as possible. Revenues from our ILS operations were flat compared to prior year, with increases coming from our Nephila MGA operations being offset by decreases in management fees from Markel CATCo due to lower assets under management and a further reduction in management fees charged on side-pocket shares. Operating expenses from ILS decreased compared to the prior year, which is primarily due to fewer professional fees associated with the review and investigation in Markel CATCo. Turning to our investment results. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. To that point, here is where you see the COVID-19 impact on the asset side of our balance sheet. Net investment losses for the quarter were $1.7 billion compared to net investment gains of $612 million last year, a year-over-year decline of $2.3 billion. Essentially all of our net investment losses in 2020 were attributable to the decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the period as COVID-19 caused unprecedented volatility in the capital markets. We've continued to see volatility in the equity markets over the course of April, but have seen some of the equity price declines to reverse. With regards to net investment income, we reported $88 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to $114 million a year ago, and the decline was mostly due to losses recognized on equity method investments. Net unrealized investment gains increased $66 million net of taxes during 2019, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from declines in interest rates during the first quarter. Now I'll cover the results of Markel Ventures segment, which, as a reminder, has its results reported on a 1 month lag. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $511 million for 2020 compared to $455 million last year, an increase of 12%. The increase in revenues was primarily related to the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security, which closed during the fourth quarter of 2019 and, to a lesser extent, an overall increase in our consumer and building products businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $67 million for 2020 compared to $55 million last year, an increase of 23%, reflecting improved operating results within one of our consumer and building products businesses and greater EBITDA within our transportation-related products businesses as well as the acquisition of VSC Fire & Security. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was 21% for the first 3 months of 2020 and 2019. We reported a net loss to shareholders of $1.4 billion for 2020 compared to net income to shareholders of $576 million a year ago. Driven by the net loss, comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first quarter was also $1.4 billion compared to comprehensive income of $732 million in 2019. And finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $66 million in 2020 compared to $19 million for 2019. Operating cash flows for 2020 reflected higher premium collections as we've seen strong growth in our insurance segment over the past several quarters. The increase also reflects the effects of lower claims settlement activity in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Partially offsetting strong cash flow activity in the first quarter was an adverse impact to cash flows for the return of collateral held for unearned premiums on a large program within our program services business that was canceled in the period. Invested assets at the holding company were $3.3 billion at the end of March compared to $4 billion at the end of the year. The decrease in holding company invested assets was due to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, again arising from COVID-19 impacts. Recognizing the importance of liquidity in times of uncertainty, we've taken several actions, including retaining cash proceeds from the maturity of short-term investments and fixed maturities, pausing our purchases of equity securities and in certain instances selling equity holdings, suspending repurchases of our shares and focusing on expense reductions across the company. We continue to maintain a fixed maturity portfolio comprised of high credit quality investment-grade securities with an average rating of AA. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of March was 27%, in line with our target range. We have no unsecured senior debt maturing in the next 24 months. We believe we are well positioned to meet our ongoing capital and liquidity needs, including the cash required to complete our pending acquisition of Lansing Building Products. Total shareholders' equity stood at $9.7 billion at the end of March compared to $11.1 billion at December 31. So in summary, the unprecedented events surrounding COVID-19 certainly impacted our quarterly results. However, the actions we've taken over the years to build a diverse and resilient organization will help us navigate through the current uncertainty arising from this pandemic. With that, I will turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses. Mark, it's Jeremy. I would just add, it's more weighted towards property and workers' comp with regards to attritional. And actually, another part of our workers comp, a little bit of mix in the portfolio between where we're writing quota shares or excess to loss contracts, they can have slightly different attritionals there. So I wouldn't read too much into that comment with regards to that moving the attritional loss ratio from a reinsurance workers' comp standpoint. Yes. It's Jeremy. I'm not going to speak to how the rating agency are maybe generally looking at it across the board. But certainly specific to Markel. I mean from a debt level standpoint and a 27% leverage ratio, that's well within our target range and certainly well within what the rating agencies are comfortable with. Won't come as a surprise. We certainly are in discussions and preview earnings in the release as we would typically for our quarter with significant events. So we've been speaking to each of the rating agencies. Because we have been acquisitive over time, you're right to point out that they will look at to varying degrees the level of goodwill and intangibles to shareholders' equity. But again, I would say while we're at the higher end of the range of kind of what they look at, there's a lot of qualitative considerations that go into that as well, when they look at the underlying business and the earnings and cash flow streams from those businesses. So nothing on that front, I think, right now, that's specifically of note. Yes. Sure. Again, Jeremy. First off, I think you will have seen and observed, I mean, there's a lot of cautionary language that we put into the Q, and we're trying to be very clear of the things that could respond relative to the levels of uncertainty that exist. Specifically in the period, we have a meaningful amount of goodwill and that's because we've been acquisitive over the years. We looked at all of our reporting units and also, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value - or sorry, it was more likely than not that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of our reporting units. Now we didn't feel like yet at the end of March that there was really kind of a triggering event. So we relied significantly on qualitative considerations and sensitivity analysis, looking at sort of the last time we had done valuations of the various reporting units. And we felt pretty comfortable at this stage. We flagged the fact that there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty. So the longer the economic shutdown goes on, the more impactful that is over a sustained period to our businesses. It's reasonable to think that there could be the possibility that those valuations would be called into question. That's something that we would be prepared at - we will be prepared to look at over time. I would say, in part, because we've conducted a number of acquisitions recently. I mean, those are some places that we'll look at very carefully, most carefully, because there's been less time since the point that we did the original valuations of those businesses. And there's quite a bit of disclosure in the Q that will lay out some of those key kind of considerations and assumptions in how we think about those accounting requirements. That's correct. Yes. And the amount of debt with the insurance subs has not moved meaningfully since the end of the year. I think that number is actually sort of disclosed out in our footnotes in the 10-K. So I don't want to quote that figure right now. But - and then with regards to sort of limits in place, there are limits in place. And I have to say, both internally and then in conjunction with what we've agreed from sort of a state rule with regards to each of our domestic insurance companies. So there are limits to when that makes good sort of economic sense and complies to the regulatory requirement."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead. \nTom Gayner: Good morning and thank you. This is indeed Tom Gayner. I'm here with our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our call today. This call is a long-standing tradition with one simple goal. We view our partnership with our long-term shareholders as a critical element in how we manage Markel on a day-to-day basis. We need you as partners to achieve our long-term goal of building one of the world's great companies. As such each quarter following the release of our quarterly financial information, we connect on the phone for just a bit to provide you with an update on our financial performance and say a few words about our plans and dreams for the next lap around the track. We deeply appreciate our long-term shareholder partners. We could not run Markel in the way we do without your support. Thank you for that. As always the goal today is to keep you fully informed as partners in the business. To do so, Jeremy will start off by recapping the 2021 financial performance. Richie will then address the conditions and performance of our insurance engine. I'll finish up with some commentary on our ventures and investment engines and then we will take your questions. Fortunately this call is as fun as it gets. All three engines of Markel provided full thrust during 2021 and we're optimistic about our prospects in the coming year. The beauty of our three-engine architecture at Markel is that it creates resilience and durability to sustain and build the company over time. Any one engine can power us forward, but the forward pace picks up a bunch when all three engines fire at the same time. 2021 was such a year. We designed the three-engine approach in order to be able to make progress through thick and thin. That said it's more fun to look at the numbers when they are thick. With that I'll turn it over to Jeremy to give you some dimensions of the thickness.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Simply put 2021 was a wonderful year for Markel as all three engines; insurance, investments, and Markel Ventures set records and contributed meaningfully towards our efforts to build shareholder value. Total revenues were $12.8 billion and we serve more customers than we ever have before. Starting off with our underwriting operations, gross written premiums were $8.5 billion for the year compared to $7.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 19%. And earned premiums increased 16% to $6.5 billion in 2021. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 84% in 2021 which is up one point from last year. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2021 was in 90 which included $195 million or three points of losses on natural catastrophes including Hurricane Ida, the floods in Europe, and Winter Storm Uri. This compares to a combined ratio of 98 for 2020 which included $358 million or 6 points of losses from COVID-19 and $172 million or 3 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Excluding the loss impacts of catastrophes and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for 2021 was an 87% compared to an 88% for 2020. This improvement reflects a nearly 4-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio, given the benefit of a favorable pricing environment and the impact of underwriting actions taken to enhance our profitability. The impact of these improvements in the combined ratio was largely offset by less favorable prior year development on loss reserves, which totaled $480 million in 2021 compared to $606 million in 2020. Our expense ratio continues to improve, given the benefit of higher net earned premiums and increased efficiency. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains included in net income were just under $2 billion in 2021, compared to $618 million in 2020. In both periods, net investment gains were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. As I've mentioned in prior calls given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $375 million for 2021 compared to $372 million last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. We continue to be diligent with regards to maintaining a high-quality fixed income portfolio, as demonstrated by our average portfolio rating of AAA. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $355 million net of taxes during 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from an increase in interest rates since the end of last year. Now I'll cover the results for our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 30% to $3.6 billion for 2021 compared to $2.8 billion last year. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products, which was acquired in April 2020 and the contribution of revenues from Buckner Heavylift Cranes, which was acquired in August 2021. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our transportation-related businesses and equipment manufacturing businesses, due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as our consumer building products businesses, given increases in demand reflecting increases in consumer spending in 2021. Our growth in revenues had a more muted impact on the bottom line, as certain of our businesses also saw cost of goods sold increase, which is a reflection of the current economic environment, where supply constraints are contributing to increasing wholesale prices across many industries. With that said, EBITDA from Markel Ventures grew 10% to $403 million for 2021, from $367 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by the increased contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was 22%. We reported net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion, compared to $798 million last year and comprehensive income to shareholders was $2.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 2020. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities reached a new high at $2.3 billion for 2021 compared to $1.7 billion for 2020. Operating cash flows for 2021 reflected strong cash flows from our insurance operations, given higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $5.3 billion at the end of the year, up from $4.1 billion at the end of last year. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14.7 billion at December 31, 2021, up 15% from $12.8 billion at the end of last year. During 2021 we repurchased 163,000 common shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program for approximately $200 million. Lastly, I thought I'd provide an update on our investment in Hagerty, the leading specialty insurance provider focused on the global automotive enthusiast market. In December, Hagerty was successful in its efforts to become a publicly listed company. We own 23% of Hagerty through both Class A common shares, which are listed for trading on the NYSE, as well as Class B common shares associated with our original investment in 2019, that can be converted on a one-for-one basis into Class A common shares. For accounting purposes, we are deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Hagerty and therefore account for our investment in Hagerty under the equity method rather than at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Hagerty was $257 million, which was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 the estimated value of our investment based on the closing stock price of Hagerty's Class A common shares was $1.1 billion. I hope that gives a sense of how strong a year Markel had in 2021 by the numbers. We're even more excited about our prospects for 2022. With that I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance businesses. \nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd really like to start by thanking everyone, all our teams in the insurance engines. Been just an incredible performance, quite honestly not just over the last year but the last two years. Dealing with the COVID situation, the war for talent that is going on currently, hard market conditions which are fun but also require a lot of work, a lot has been thrown at our folks and they have responded wonderfully. So I just want to thank them. Today I'm really excited to discuss with you our insurance engine's 2021 achievements. First and most importantly, as Jeremy said, we delivered on our goal to produce a 90% combined ratio in our underwriting operations. To provide a little perspective, this represents Markel's fourth lowest combined ratio in the past 30 years and a record smashing $628 million of underwriting profits. We accomplished this result despite the second largest insured nat cat year on record, which included events such as Uri, Ida and the European floods. Natural catastrophe losses impacted our consolidated combined ratio by three points in 2021. This was a significant decrease from the average annual impact we've experienced over the previous four years. In 2021, our strategy is to manage the impact of nat cat volatility worked. Regarding business production, we had a fantastic year, hitting record highs in gross written premium volumes within both our underwriting operations and our State National Program Services businesses. We continue to see many new business opportunities and strong renewal retentions coupled with meaningful rate increases. Our teams have worked extremely hard to capture the benefit from the current market and their efforts led us to $8.5 billion of gross written premium in our underwriting operations. That's a 19% increase year-over-year and $2.7 billion of gross written premium at State National, a 31% increase year-over-year. So now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within the insurance engine which includes our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So kicking off with the Insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the segment were up 20% this year with just over $7.2 billion in premium writings while earned premiums were up 17% for the year. We saw growth across many of our insurance products in particular within our professional liability and general liability product lines where we've been able to identify new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations. We continue to benefit from favorable rate environments within most of our insurance product lines. The 2021 combined ratio in the Insurance segment was 87% compared to 96% last year. The current year combined ratio included $95 million or 2 points of net losses related to 2021 cat events, while the 2020 combined ratio included $124 million or 3 points of net losses related to 2020 cat events and $296 million or 6 points of losses related to COVID-19. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio decreased by 2 points, due to a 4-point decrease in our attritional loss ratio across several product lines, due to the impact from premium rates and our ability to write more premium in our preferred product classes. This was partially offset by a decrease in favorable development from prior accident years. The 2021 year represented the first year of our 10-5-1 objective to deliver $10 billion in annual gross written premiums in five years with $1 billion of annual underwriting profits or a 90% combined ratio or better. While we're only one year into 10-5-1, we're mathematically slightly ahead of our goals at this point. And that is a good thing, because we know, we have a very favorable market conditions currently, and let's be honest we don't know what the market will look like in future years, and it may not be as strong. We're not planning to rest on these achievements and our Insurance leadership teams are focused on strategies to continue to deliver in 2022 and forward. So turning to the Reinsurance segment. Let me begin with an update and reminder on our transition strategies related to the various reinsurance property lines. First, as previously discussed starting in the first quarter of 2021, we successfully transitioned our reinsurance property line from our Reinsurance segment underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations. Second, we announced in the fourth quarter our plan to exit from Lodgepine in our retro property reinsurance book. While the team at Lodgepine worked incredibly hard to raise capital, and had built a quality portfolio given the very challenging fundraising environments we've reached the difficult decision to exit. Finally, in the fourth quarter we purchased additional reinsurance protection to transition the remaining runoff of our property cat reinsurance book to third parties. With these changes, we will have minimal property cat exposure in our Reinsurance segment going forward. Management's current focus within reinsurance is to grow and optimize our profitability within the core casualty, professional liability, and specialty reinsurance lines, seeking to attain at least a 90% combined ratio on those product lines longer term. So moving into the segment results. Gross written premium within the Reinsurance segment were up 10% for the year, while earned premiums were up 12%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, resulting from both new business and growth in underlying accounts that we support. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines, due to the transition strategies I just mentioned. The combined ratio for the year within the Reinsurance segment was 105 versus 104 a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $100 million or 10 points of losses from 2021 in cat events, while the prior year combined ratio included $62 million or seven points of losses from COVID-19, and $48 million or five points of net losses from 20 cat events. Catastrophe losses in 2021 were primarily within our property reinsurance and property retro reinsurance product lines. And as I've mentioned both have been placed into runoff. Excluding the impact for these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio increased by two points from last year due to higher prior year loss ratios and that was primarily related to property product lines and additional exposures recognized related to prior year premium adjustments in our professional liability lines. This increase was partially offset by a lower attritional loss ratio within our professional liability and general liability lines and a lower expense ratio, due to lower compensation costs and the impact of higher earned premiums. Next, I'll touch on program services, and our ILS operations both of which are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premiums within our program services and other funding operations is ceded to third parties. As I mentioned earlier, we had a record year within our program services operations with premium production of over $2.7 billion for the year at State National. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. Fee revenues were up 21% from a year ago and State National continues to produce extremely strong operating margins. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market. Next, I'll discuss ILS operations. With our announcement of the exit from Lodgepine operations, all results from Lodgepine have been transitioned to other. Therefore, the results from our ILS operations consist solely of the results of our Nephila operations. For the year, revenue from Nephila operations are up slightly due to continued growth in the MGA revenues produced at Velocity and Volante, partially offset by lower investment management fees due to lower assets under management. Assets under management at Nephila were $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. As I've mentioned in the past, the last five years of cat activity have been particularly difficult for the ILS market and of course for Nephila. Despite these headwinds we have full confidence in Nephila to produce solid results over the long term. Nephila continues to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and to launch new investment opportunities. And we continue to look for opportunities to achieve synergies among our various insurance platforms, underwriting program services and ILS so that we can provide customized insurance solutions to match the right risk to the right capital. I'd quickly like to mention that in December, we announced the planned sale of our Velocity operations and the closing of that transaction was completed on February 1. This transaction expands opportunities for the Velocity team and Velocity will continue to be a significant production partner for Nephila and Nephila will remain a minority shareholder. So I'll finish up with some market commentary. Conditions continue to be favorable and we expect to achieve rate increases in the great majority of our lines as we go through 2022. There is no doubt that after three years and in some cases four years of rate increases it's going to be difficult to continue to average double-digit growth in rates across our portfolio like we did in 2021. Given all the issues that we previously discussed such as goods and services inflation, social inflation and low interest rates we are going to continue to push for rate increases to make sure we can stay ahead of claims trend.  However the specialty insurance market is not one monolithic market. Our underwriting teams will be assessing rate adequacy and market conditions in each of our over 100 specialty lines and we'll adjust our underwriting and pricing strategies accordingly. I think we're entering a more nuanced phase of the market cycle. In some lines where conditions might be more competitive, we could potentially scale back our appetite. While in other lines where we continue to see big opportunities we are going to be full speed ahead. Thank you for your time today. And now I'd like to turn things over to Tom. \nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. As Jeremy noted we enjoyed a record year at Markel Ventures. We had record revenues of $3.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion and record EBITDA of $403 million compared to $367 million. We added Buckner Cranes to the family in August and Metromont at year-end and we should benefit from those two great businesses joining the family in the years ahead. In the short run the numbers are very good, but they do not come without strain and challenge. From our vantage point everything you hear about supply chain problems is real. People and material are hard and tough to come by and some of the margin pressures we experienced during the year reflect that reality. I cannot thank our managers and the people of Markel Ventures enough for how they are responding to the conditions they face. A year ago you heard the word unprecedented over and over. Now I would say that we're looking at precedented conditions. 2021 results largely compare with 2020 results that took place under the conditions of the pandemic. I would say that unprecedented is now morphing into unrelenting. The unrelenting daily grind of trying to figure out how to keep our team on the field and recruit new players, procure supplies, maintain margins and manage the countless moving parts in such a dynamic system is unrelenting. Our people continue to perform in a first-class way against these unrelenting headwinds and I am proud of them and I am grateful for their work. I also recognize it takes energy to sustain our businesses and I don't think I'm breaking any news to you to tell you that our people are tired. Me too. Despite all of that you can be confident that our businesses are led and staffed by a team infused with our culture. They continue to bend over backwards to take care of our customers and each other. The pandemic era stands as a tough, but telling test that demonstrates the quality of the people on our team. I can report to you we've got a great team. In our investing operations, we enjoyed a spectacular year in our equity investments with a return of 29.6%. Our fixed income operations protected our balance sheet and while the return of the fixed income portfolio was a negative 0.7%, the entirety of that decline was caused by mark-to-market fluctuation impacts of higher interest rates. The total return for the portfolio was 7.3%. While there's always a time lag, if interest rates rise, our investment income will increase every time a bond matures and we purchase a new one at a higher coupon rate. We also keep the duration of the portfolio pretty matched to our insurance liabilities in both time and currency, so the net effect of interest rate or foreign exchange changes remains de minimis for Markel. I am happy with how we continue to protect and maintain the balance sheet with our fixed income holdings. While this is a quarterly call and we're describing the short-term investment results of 2021, I think it's worthwhile to remember that Markel is a long-term-oriented company. We've been investing with our disciplined four part strategy for over 30 years now. And over that 30-year time frame, we've outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 100 basis points. That's a pretty tough hurdle, and I hope the long-term results provide you with confidence that our strategy for our investment engine is durable and effective. Since I suggested that unprecedented is being supplanted by unrelenting, let me suggest some of the things about which we are being unrelenting. We continue to steadily invest in publicly traded equities in an unrelenting fashion. We're unrelenting in seeking growth initiatives in our insurance and Ventures businesses and we're willing and able to fund attractive opportunities. We're unrelenting in our search to find new partners and teams that are eager to join Markel as witnessed by Buckner and Metromont. We're unrelenting in our actions of continuing to deploy capital at good rates of return. Finding good businesses and wonderful people who treasure our long-term culture is a special skill. We've been doing it now for decades, but I don't think the market really values this attribute of Markel. Since actions speak louder than words, we're unrelenting in our practice of repurchasing Markel shares and we think they represent an attractive value. Coupling these unrelenting behaviors and commitments on the financial side, along with operational excellence from our insurance and ventures operations, causes me to be unrelenting in my optimism that we're doing the right things in order to build one of the world's great companies. We hope you share our sense of optimism. We thank you for your support and your commitment. We're now delighted to answer your questions. Andrew, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJeff Schmitt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. The -- how do retentions look in some of the key business lines in the insurance segment, where you've pushed some of the highest rate? I think you mentioned they're kind of flat overall, maybe 84%. But just wondering what it looked like in some of those lines that you push the highest rate, maybe professional liability or what have you?\nRichie Whitt: Jeff, retentions are good. When -- 84%, I think you might be thinking about our net retention after purchases of reinsurance, because I think that's about what that number is. But I mentioned, we have over 100 lines of business and renewal retention in those lines of business that would be a spectrum. I mean, it would be probably anywhere from in the 50% range to the low 90s in some of our books of business in terms of the renewal retention. I think renewal retentions are holding up pretty well right now. Although, it is certainly the case in some of the lines of business where rates were maybe in the fourth year of rate increases and there have been some big rate increases. There's some fatigue creeping in, in terms of the insurance. And as you go through the market cycle, it would not be surprising to see renewable retention start to drop a bit in some of those areas. And that would be things like probably in D&O and some of your financial institution lines, things of that sort. But as of right now, I think we're keeping the accounts we want to keep. We feel good about them. And I think that -- I would expect that later in the market cycle.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And right. I was referring to policyholder retention and it does -- so it does sound like you're seeing some competition return to the market, some deceleration in some of those lines that have pushed the highest rate.\nRichie Whitt: Yes, absolutely. I think, everybody would say that. I think it's still a great market. I think we're still able to push rate increases. But again after three and in some cases four years of rate increases, you're just not going to be able to maintain double-digit rate increases.\nJeff Schmitt: Right, right. Okay. And then, a question on the reinsurance segment and just thinking about the property cat retrocessional books are largely run off now. How much catastrophe exposure is really left there? And, I guess, maybe the way to think about it is, if cat losses were 10% of earned premium in 2021 what would that be if those lines would have been run off throughout the year. I mean, would that be zero or two or -- yes.\nRichie Whitt: The -- I forget what the number was, did I say about $100 million in cat losses in reinsurance for the year. I believe, that number would have been -- assuming we had none of the property that we are running off on risk at the beginning of the year, that had been $10 million or $15 million.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay, okay. So pretty substantial change. And then, just one last question on exposures. Can you maybe talk about what exposures are in the insurance segment? And if you could kind of break that into maybe the economic exposure being driven by inflation versus presumably you have a bit of a headwind from terms and conditions. I'm just trying to get a sense on those two components.\nRichie Whitt: Well, if you're talking about -- exposure is growing, obviously. We grew close to almost 20% in 2021. So we have grown exposure on our balance sheet. There's no doubt. At the same time, though, we've achieved double-digit rate increases, roughly 10% rate increase across the book and we've been tightening terms and conditions. So -- and I don't have exact numbers. You'd really have to dig in line by line. But because of just growth, exposures are up, but exposures are not up as much as premium is up because of what we've been doing in terms of rate and terms and conditions.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. Good morning.\nRichie Whitt: Good morning.\nMark Hughes: In the Reinsurance segment you talked about a 90% combined being a long-term target. Is the mix of business you've got now is that something that's perhaps achievable in the nearer term?\nRichie Whitt: We're going to be walking towards that. Obviously, this year, it's very difficult to discern the underlying performance of the ongoing book, because of all the cat losses. But what I can tell you is the underlying go-forward book came in at about a 96% combined this year. And we would expect that to be better in 2022 but probably not all the way to the 90 that is our target. So we'll continue to make progress towards that 90 in 2022, but more likely to get there hopefully in 2023. \nMark Hughes: And then just generally on favorable development it was -- it's still quite good, but down relative to 2020. Any general comments about what you're seeing in the reserves that influence that?\nJeremy Noble: Hey, Mark, it's Jeremy. A couple of comments there. So, you're right. In dollar terms, the favorable prior year loss reserve development was lower year-over-year. A big piece of that as you may have picked up on was within the Reinsurance segment. And I think that's a little bit different as far as considering sort of trend over time. That was -- a lot of that was really kind of what was happening a year ago favorable prior year adjustments on a number of sort of natural catastrophe that's within the property space, and this year a little bit of adverse development relative to kind of COVID and property creating sort of that differentiation. That was the biggest driver. In the insurance book, we were also a little bit lower year-over-year. That primarily comes from lower favorable development on our professional liability lines this year compared to a year ago. Some of that was a few specific larger losses that we recognized on older years. And then I would just suggest that we're going to continue to be quite cautious on the recent accident years as we continue to sort of let time pass and monitor claims frequency and severity trends. So, nothing different as far as loss reserving philosophy, nothing different with regards to the fact that we believe that loss reserves will prove more likely to be redundant and deficient over time. And I don't think there's anything more that I would kind of point to other than that.\nMark Hughes: Yes. And then one final question on Hagerty. If you sold a few points of your position and drop below 20%, would that be good for book value?\nJeremy Noble: It is a more complicated analysis than that. You're right that in the accounting rule one of those kind of key presumptions is the 20% ownership. But we also have other sort of commercial relationships and arrangements with Hagerty. We have certain rights that come with the voting interest that we have retained from the original investment we had. So it would not be as simple as if we came in at 19.9% that adjustment would change.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.\nTom Gayner: I'll jump in if I may and also try to address. We give the very best we can to try to talk about what the economic value of Markel is and the pieces and components of that. And believe me, I started out life as an accountant, and I'm no longer an accountant, but those are different things.\nMark Hughes: Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Fox of Fenimore Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Hey, thank you. Good morning everyone.\nTom Gayner : Hey, John.\nJohn Fox : Terrific year. Thank you. Hey, Rich I have a couple of questions for you. With the run-off and changes in reinsurance, I keep expecting it to shrink and it keeps growing. So could you talk about for 2022, do you think gross written will grow after the changes you made last year? What should we expect there for reinsurance? \nRichie Whitt: Yes. I'll be honest, we were a little surprised that where we ended up the year as well, John. And again, I've talked about in the past, and maybe I need to keep talking about each quarter. I mean, your elephant hunting in reinsurance, these are -- when you decide to write an account that can be 30, 40, 50 and more millions of dollars of premium. And so it only takes a couple of elephants to really change what the premium volume is going to look like. So, as we got closer to the end of the year, we saw, just like I said, two or three or four really interesting opportunities in terms of casualty and professional and specialty programs that we decided to write that resulted in the premium that you saw. It's a little difficult to say, but our growth is not our objective in 2022. Profitability is our objective in 2022. And so we're going to continue to be very focused on that. And so while I don't expect growth we're not going to pass on great opportunities if we see them. So I'm going to sit here and tell you more than likely we would expect it to be flattish, but we're not going to pass on great opportunities because we said that we might be flat.\nJohn Fox: No of course. And then if you could just comment on State National maybe for this year. It's really grown nicely last year, which is a very hard compare to repeat that. And you mentioned some increased competition. So is that an area you expect to grow this year, or...\nRichie Whitt: Look, we certainly hope to grow but we certainly would not expect or budget for 31% growth. The State National of course, benefited from the same things our underwriting operations are benefiting from which is more rate coming through and more premium moving into the specialty markets. So that helped a lot. But we've got to be realistic as well. Fiber, more years ago there would have been two or three competitors. And at last count I think there were 20-plus competitors in the fronting or hybrid fronting market today. So we're going to have our work cut out for us to grow and that is our goal but certainly don't expect 31%.\nJohn Fox: Right. Sure. And then my last question for you. There was a $41 million amortization of intangibles that's in underwriting operations but not linked to insurance or reinsurance. So I was confused on what that is.\nJeremy Noble: Hey, John, it's Jeremy. I'd have to kind of compare that number with you but \u2013 where you picked that up. But we would have meaningful amortization associated with the original acquisition of both State National and Nephila. And we would have a meaningful amount of amortization that would be attributed within Ventures segment associated with the acquisitions of Ventures and then a modest amount of amortization associated with acquisitions we would have made some period of time ago. So I have to kind of cross reference, the exact number you're picking up from where but \u2013 and those numbers when we have operating revenues and operating expenses, if you're looking kind of within the other space, that would exclude the effect of amortization.\nJohn Fox: Right. Okay. Thank you. And then Tom Gayner there's been a small increase in interest rates in the front end of the curve. And just curious any changes on the fixed income side, or do you \u2013 the net interest income has been running down of course as interest rates have stayed low. Do you see that continuing or changing with the movements in interest rates that occurred this year?\nTom Gayner: Yes. I don't know how long it would be before sort of bonds we purchased with a higher coupon rate completely run-off and you do replace those with the newer coupons at a higher rate. But the philosophy in the way we're doing things really remain unchanged. And the point is match the fixed income up against the insurance liabilities and if insurance rate's at a 90 and we earn any money at all on fixed income that's a spread that most people in any financial business would be delighted with. So we got that and we make plenty on ventures and we make money on our equity investments.\nJohn Fox: Yes. I mean with $700 million in underwriting... \nTom Gayner: That's up... \nJohn Fox: With $700 million of underwriting profit in insurance that's terrific. So I was just curious if that line is going to turn anytime soon and it sounds like it's going to take more time.\nTom Gayner: Probably. And I guess the point I'm trying to convey is whether it was next Tuesday or Tuesday, three years from now we're not going to operate fixed income any differently. \nJohn Fox: Right. I didn't expect that you would. Thank you.\nTom Gayner: We've known one another for a long time. I should have let you answer the question. \nJeremy Noble: Hey, John, it's Jeremy. Just to clarify that \u2013 I just see that amortization figure you picked up. That is associated with acquisitions and intangibles associated with acquisitions we made in the insurance or reinsurance space so take for example I'll tear back in 2013 that are attributed to the segments and the segment's underwriting profits don't include amortization. That's just a reconciliation point. Nothing new or different in that space.\nJohn Fox: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question will come from Roland Mayer [ph] of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. With the growth and changes in sort of insurance exposures during the year, did you make any changes to your own reinsurance buying?\nRichie Whitt: Roland, honestly our reinsurance buying was pretty consistent, kind of, the form of our programs very similar. I guess, the biggest difference would be we're buying considerably less property reinsurance now, because we reduced property exposure so much. But other than that, it's been pretty steady as she goes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then I think you talked a bit about the impact of the deflation on the Ventures business from an expense side. On the revenue side, are they -- are you seeing good pricing increases across those businesses? And what do you expect there as supply chain issues hopefully get a little better?\nTom Gayner: Yes. In the normal monthly flow of information, the quarterly cycle of Board meetings I can assure you that pretty much topic number one is making sure that you're raising prices because that's the reality of what it takes to run the business. So there's time lines always in managing that process. But we need to reflect the cost of what it cost to do business in our products and services. And every single manager of any one of those businesses is doing exactly that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Those are my two questions. Thank you.\nRichie Whitt: Thank you.\nTom Gayner: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Kennedy of DS Dent. Please go ahead.\nBruce Kennedy: Congratulations on the strong results you all.\nTom Gayner: Thank you.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks Bruce.\nBruce Kennedy: I have a couple of questions. First of all Richie, I just wanted to clarify and just make sure I understood the comment that you made earlier. I think you said you won't hit the 90% target in 2022 except you expect to in 2023. And was that for reinsurance or for the consolidated insurance operations?\nRichie Whitt: That was -- just speaking about reinsurance Bruce, but I will say hey if we catch some breaks, we might could hit the 90% in reinsurance in 2022. But if I talk in terms of the plan we've put together, we will make progress on it from the 96% that that underlying business did this year towards that 90% but not quite get there. And thus I would hope we would definitely be there in 2023.\nJeremy Noble: I think it's also fair to say that the business we're putting on the books now, we believe is priced at we'll hit the 90%, but there's a lag consideration there right? We're going to watch the development as we typically would and that will come through in later years. So again there's a count lag effect but\u2026\nRichie Whitt: Yeah. That's a really good point that Jeremy makes Bruce. We believe the business we've priced the last three years is pricing up better than a 90% combined. But due to our reserving philosophy, we're going to be -- try to be more likely redundant than deficient. And so we're going to wait and hopefully see that development over time.\nBruce Kennedy: Right. Okay. And then on a consolidated basis, is 90% or better still kind of how you're thinking about things?\nRichie Whitt: Absolutely. Yeah. I guess, I would say in 2022, it's a little bit more of the same from 2021. We'd like to continue to grow at a double-digit rate given what -- how we view market conditions right now and we'd like it to be a 90% or better combined ratio at the end of the year.\nBruce Kennedy: Got it. Great. Moving over to on the Hagerty topic. Tom or Rich, I wonder if you all might in layman's terms be able just to briefly run through how the Hagerty relationship start and then -- and how it's evolved over time? And in mentioning the cost basis or the book value of $200-and-some million and then the effective value of $1.1 billion, would it be fair to say that the company is essentially 5x of it\u2019s value over that time frame, or does the accounting -- is the accounting misleading and that conclusion would not be correct?\nRichie Whitt: Well, Bruce, we've been working with Hagerty, I think it's going on nine years now. And as many of our partnerships, relationships start, it started with personal relationships between ourselves and Michael [ph] Hagerty and some of his team there. We started out relatively modestly. I think we started working with them on some of their commercial business that comes along with their auto-related business. So, a few million dollars to begin with and then we became their fronting partner and major largest taker of the risk over the next several years. The opportunity came to deepen our partnership back in -- well, I guess we started the discussions in 2018. The opportunity came to deepen our partnership and become part owners minority owners with the Hagerty family. And that transaction was completed in I guess 2019. And then moving forward they saw the need to continue to grow their business. I mean they've grown at double-digit rates that entire time that we've been working with them mid to high teens and they saw the need for capital to continue to grow the business and saw the opportunity through going public to access that capital and also obviously provide some liquidity for the family members. So, it's been a wonderful partnership a wonderful journey with the Hagerty family. And once you go from the private world to the public world and you can get a mark each day that accounts for the difference. \nTom Gayner: Bruce I want to jump in with a couple of points on that. One Richie deserves the credit for captaining the process of the relationship. And I think that story that he just told you is a marvelous example of the kind of acorns that are continuously planted around this organization over and over and over again in an unrelenting fashion. And you never know where these things lead but if you keep doing the right things it's amazing the Oaktree that grow out of them sometime. So, that's a qualitative statement that I think is important to make and Richie captained that process. And number two just in highlighting sort of the way accounting leads to different numbers on the page at different points in time. So, the initial debt that was on our books was the initial checks that were written plus our proportionate share of the earnings of the organization which is just equity method accounting 101. And then now there is a mark-to-market mechanism i.e. the publicly traded stock which you can make some reference to and because of accounting rules which has already been discussed earlier we know what they are and you know what they are and you can attach numbers but they don't get included in our financial statements. So, all we know how to do is just to tell you all of the inputs and all the facts and all the data and let you draw your own conclusion.\nBruce Kennedy: Congratulations. And my last question what's the biggest governor to your stock buyback program right now? Thank you very much for the questions.\nTom Gayner: We just want to be able to be consistent and always answered the bell for the next round of the fight. So, obviously, there's daily volume requirements and things like that that you need to be inside of but we wish to behave in a systemic and disciplined and regular matter. And I know sometimes and believe me there's discussions going around here. about the pace of which we're doing some of the things we're doing. But as I remember Buffett saying that in an annual meeting a number of years ago when you're getting ahead, don't argue about whether you're galloping or not. So, we're going to focus on getting ahead and behaving in the systemic way and the same way you've come to expect from us over years and years.\nBruce Kennedy: Agreed. Thank you all very much.\nTom Gayner: Thank you.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks. \nTom Gayner: Thank you very much. Great to be with you. We look forward to connecting again after the first quarter you well. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you. This is indeed Tom Gayner. I'm here with our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. It's my pleasure to welcome you to our call today. This call is a long-standing tradition with one simple goal. We view our partnership with our long-term shareholders as a critical element in how we manage Markel on a day-to-day basis. We need you as partners to achieve our long-term goal of building one of the world's great companies. As such each quarter following the release of our quarterly financial information, we connect on the phone for just a bit to provide you with an update on our financial performance and say a few words about our plans and dreams for the next lap around the track. We deeply appreciate our long-term shareholder partners. We could not run Markel in the way we do without your support. Thank you for that. As always the goal today is to keep you fully informed as partners in the business. To do so, Jeremy will start off by recapping the 2021 financial performance. Richie will then address the conditions and performance of our insurance engine. I'll finish up with some commentary on our ventures and investment engines and then we will take your questions. Fortunately this call is as fun as it gets. All three engines of Markel provided full thrust during 2021 and we're optimistic about our prospects in the coming year. The beauty of our three-engine architecture at Markel is that it creates resilience and durability to sustain and build the company over time. Any one engine can power us forward, but the forward pace picks up a bunch when all three engines fire at the same time. 2021 was such a year. We designed the three-engine approach in order to be able to make progress through thick and thin. That said it's more fun to look at the numbers when they are thick. With that I'll turn it over to Jeremy to give you some dimensions of the thickness. Thank you, Richie. As Jeremy noted we enjoyed a record year at Markel Ventures. We had record revenues of $3.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion and record EBITDA of $403 million compared to $367 million. We added Buckner Cranes to the family in August and Metromont at year-end and we should benefit from those two great businesses joining the family in the years ahead. In the short run the numbers are very good, but they do not come without strain and challenge. From our vantage point everything you hear about supply chain problems is real. People and material are hard and tough to come by and some of the margin pressures we experienced during the year reflect that reality. I cannot thank our managers and the people of Markel Ventures enough for how they are responding to the conditions they face. A year ago you heard the word unprecedented over and over. Now I would say that we're looking at precedented conditions. 2021 results largely compare with 2020 results that took place under the conditions of the pandemic. I would say that unprecedented is now morphing into unrelenting. The unrelenting daily grind of trying to figure out how to keep our team on the field and recruit new players, procure supplies, maintain margins and manage the countless moving parts in such a dynamic system is unrelenting. Our people continue to perform in a first-class way against these unrelenting headwinds and I am proud of them and I am grateful for their work. I also recognize it takes energy to sustain our businesses and I don't think I'm breaking any news to you to tell you that our people are tired. Me too. Despite all of that you can be confident that our businesses are led and staffed by a team infused with our culture. They continue to bend over backwards to take care of our customers and each other. The pandemic era stands as a tough, but telling test that demonstrates the quality of the people on our team. I can report to you we've got a great team. In our investing operations, we enjoyed a spectacular year in our equity investments with a return of 29.6%. Our fixed income operations protected our balance sheet and while the return of the fixed income portfolio was a negative 0.7%, the entirety of that decline was caused by mark-to-market fluctuation impacts of higher interest rates. The total return for the portfolio was 7.3%. While there's always a time lag, if interest rates rise, our investment income will increase every time a bond matures and we purchase a new one at a higher coupon rate. We also keep the duration of the portfolio pretty matched to our insurance liabilities in both time and currency, so the net effect of interest rate or foreign exchange changes remains de minimis for Markel. I am happy with how we continue to protect and maintain the balance sheet with our fixed income holdings. While this is a quarterly call and we're describing the short-term investment results of 2021, I think it's worthwhile to remember that Markel is a long-term-oriented company. We've been investing with our disciplined four part strategy for over 30 years now. And over that 30-year time frame, we've outperformed the S&P 500 Index by over 100 basis points. That's a pretty tough hurdle, and I hope the long-term results provide you with confidence that our strategy for our investment engine is durable and effective. Since I suggested that unprecedented is being supplanted by unrelenting, let me suggest some of the things about which we are being unrelenting. We continue to steadily invest in publicly traded equities in an unrelenting fashion. We're unrelenting in seeking growth initiatives in our insurance and Ventures businesses and we're willing and able to fund attractive opportunities. We're unrelenting in our search to find new partners and teams that are eager to join Markel as witnessed by Buckner and Metromont. We're unrelenting in our actions of continuing to deploy capital at good rates of return. Finding good businesses and wonderful people who treasure our long-term culture is a special skill. We've been doing it now for decades, but I don't think the market really values this attribute of Markel. Since actions speak louder than words, we're unrelenting in our practice of repurchasing Markel shares and we think they represent an attractive value. Coupling these unrelenting behaviors and commitments on the financial side, along with operational excellence from our insurance and ventures operations, causes me to be unrelenting in my optimism that we're doing the right things in order to build one of the world's great companies. We hope you share our sense of optimism. We thank you for your support and your commitment. We're now delighted to answer your questions. Andrew, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor. I'll jump in if I may and also try to address. We give the very best we can to try to talk about what the economic value of Markel is and the pieces and components of that. And believe me, I started out life as an accountant, and I'm no longer an accountant, but those are different things. Hey, John. Yes. I don't know how long it would be before sort of bonds we purchased with a higher coupon rate completely run-off and you do replace those with the newer coupons at a higher rate. But the philosophy in the way we're doing things really remain unchanged. And the point is match the fixed income up against the insurance liabilities and if insurance rate's at a 90 and we earn any money at all on fixed income that's a spread that most people in any financial business would be delighted with. So we got that and we make plenty on ventures and we make money on our equity investments. That's up... Probably. And I guess the point I'm trying to convey is whether it was next Tuesday or Tuesday, three years from now we're not going to operate fixed income any differently. We've known one another for a long time. I should have let you answer the question. Yes. In the normal monthly flow of information, the quarterly cycle of Board meetings I can assure you that pretty much topic number one is making sure that you're raising prices because that's the reality of what it takes to run the business. So there's time lines always in managing that process. But we need to reflect the cost of what it cost to do business in our products and services. And every single manager of any one of those businesses is doing exactly that. Thanks. Thank you. Bruce I want to jump in with a couple of points on that. One Richie deserves the credit for captaining the process of the relationship. And I think that story that he just told you is a marvelous example of the kind of acorns that are continuously planted around this organization over and over and over again in an unrelenting fashion. And you never know where these things lead but if you keep doing the right things it's amazing the Oaktree that grow out of them sometime. So, that's a qualitative statement that I think is important to make and Richie captained that process. And number two just in highlighting sort of the way accounting leads to different numbers on the page at different points in time. So, the initial debt that was on our books was the initial checks that were written plus our proportionate share of the earnings of the organization which is just equity method accounting 101. And then now there is a mark-to-market mechanism i.e. the publicly traded stock which you can make some reference to and because of accounting rules which has already been discussed earlier we know what they are and you know what they are and you can attach numbers but they don't get included in our financial statements. So, all we know how to do is just to tell you all of the inputs and all the facts and all the data and let you draw your own conclusion. We just want to be able to be consistent and always answered the bell for the next round of the fight. So, obviously, there's daily volume requirements and things like that that you need to be inside of but we wish to behave in a systemic and disciplined and regular matter. And I know sometimes and believe me there's discussions going around here. about the pace of which we're doing some of the things we're doing. But as I remember Buffett saying that in an annual meeting a number of years ago when you're getting ahead, don't argue about whether you're galloping or not. So, we're going to focus on getting ahead and behaving in the systemic way and the same way you've come to expect from us over years and years. Thank you. Thank you very much. Great to be with you. We look forward to connecting again after the first quarter you well. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd really like to start by thanking everyone, all our teams in the insurance engines. Been just an incredible performance, quite honestly not just over the last year but the last two years. Dealing with the COVID situation, the war for talent that is going on currently, hard market conditions which are fun but also require a lot of work, a lot has been thrown at our folks and they have responded wonderfully. So I just want to thank them. Today I'm really excited to discuss with you our insurance engine's 2021 achievements. First and most importantly, as Jeremy said, we delivered on our goal to produce a 90% combined ratio in our underwriting operations. To provide a little perspective, this represents Markel's fourth lowest combined ratio in the past 30 years and a record smashing $628 million of underwriting profits. We accomplished this result despite the second largest insured nat cat year on record, which included events such as Uri, Ida and the European floods. Natural catastrophe losses impacted our consolidated combined ratio by three points in 2021. This was a significant decrease from the average annual impact we've experienced over the previous four years. In 2021, our strategy is to manage the impact of nat cat volatility worked. Regarding business production, we had a fantastic year, hitting record highs in gross written premium volumes within both our underwriting operations and our State National Program Services businesses. We continue to see many new business opportunities and strong renewal retentions coupled with meaningful rate increases. Our teams have worked extremely hard to capture the benefit from the current market and their efforts led us to $8.5 billion of gross written premium in our underwriting operations. That's a 19% increase year-over-year and $2.7 billion of gross written premium at State National, a 31% increase year-over-year. So now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within the insurance engine which includes our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So kicking off with the Insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the segment were up 20% this year with just over $7.2 billion in premium writings while earned premiums were up 17% for the year. We saw growth across many of our insurance products in particular within our professional liability and general liability product lines where we've been able to identify new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations. We continue to benefit from favorable rate environments within most of our insurance product lines. The 2021 combined ratio in the Insurance segment was 87% compared to 96% last year. The current year combined ratio included $95 million or 2 points of net losses related to 2021 cat events, while the 2020 combined ratio included $124 million or 3 points of net losses related to 2020 cat events and $296 million or 6 points of losses related to COVID-19. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio decreased by 2 points, due to a 4-point decrease in our attritional loss ratio across several product lines, due to the impact from premium rates and our ability to write more premium in our preferred product classes. This was partially offset by a decrease in favorable development from prior accident years. The 2021 year represented the first year of our 10-5-1 objective to deliver $10 billion in annual gross written premiums in five years with $1 billion of annual underwriting profits or a 90% combined ratio or better. While we're only one year into 10-5-1, we're mathematically slightly ahead of our goals at this point. And that is a good thing, because we know, we have a very favorable market conditions currently, and let's be honest we don't know what the market will look like in future years, and it may not be as strong. We're not planning to rest on these achievements and our Insurance leadership teams are focused on strategies to continue to deliver in 2022 and forward. So turning to the Reinsurance segment. Let me begin with an update and reminder on our transition strategies related to the various reinsurance property lines. First, as previously discussed starting in the first quarter of 2021, we successfully transitioned our reinsurance property line from our Reinsurance segment underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations. Second, we announced in the fourth quarter our plan to exit from Lodgepine in our retro property reinsurance book. While the team at Lodgepine worked incredibly hard to raise capital, and had built a quality portfolio given the very challenging fundraising environments we've reached the difficult decision to exit. Finally, in the fourth quarter we purchased additional reinsurance protection to transition the remaining runoff of our property cat reinsurance book to third parties. With these changes, we will have minimal property cat exposure in our Reinsurance segment going forward. Management's current focus within reinsurance is to grow and optimize our profitability within the core casualty, professional liability, and specialty reinsurance lines, seeking to attain at least a 90% combined ratio on those product lines longer term. So moving into the segment results. Gross written premium within the Reinsurance segment were up 10% for the year, while earned premiums were up 12%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, resulting from both new business and growth in underlying accounts that we support. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines, due to the transition strategies I just mentioned. The combined ratio for the year within the Reinsurance segment was 105 versus 104 a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $100 million or 10 points of losses from 2021 in cat events, while the prior year combined ratio included $62 million or seven points of losses from COVID-19, and $48 million or five points of net losses from 20 cat events. Catastrophe losses in 2021 were primarily within our property reinsurance and property retro reinsurance product lines. And as I've mentioned both have been placed into runoff. Excluding the impact for these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio increased by two points from last year due to higher prior year loss ratios and that was primarily related to property product lines and additional exposures recognized related to prior year premium adjustments in our professional liability lines. This increase was partially offset by a lower attritional loss ratio within our professional liability and general liability lines and a lower expense ratio, due to lower compensation costs and the impact of higher earned premiums. Next, I'll touch on program services, and our ILS operations both of which are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premiums within our program services and other funding operations is ceded to third parties. As I mentioned earlier, we had a record year within our program services operations with premium production of over $2.7 billion for the year at State National. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. Fee revenues were up 21% from a year ago and State National continues to produce extremely strong operating margins. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market. Next, I'll discuss ILS operations. With our announcement of the exit from Lodgepine operations, all results from Lodgepine have been transitioned to other. Therefore, the results from our ILS operations consist solely of the results of our Nephila operations. For the year, revenue from Nephila operations are up slightly due to continued growth in the MGA revenues produced at Velocity and Volante, partially offset by lower investment management fees due to lower assets under management. Assets under management at Nephila were $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2021. As I've mentioned in the past, the last five years of cat activity have been particularly difficult for the ILS market and of course for Nephila. Despite these headwinds we have full confidence in Nephila to produce solid results over the long term. Nephila continues to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and to launch new investment opportunities. And we continue to look for opportunities to achieve synergies among our various insurance platforms, underwriting program services and ILS so that we can provide customized insurance solutions to match the right risk to the right capital. I'd quickly like to mention that in December, we announced the planned sale of our Velocity operations and the closing of that transaction was completed on February 1. This transaction expands opportunities for the Velocity team and Velocity will continue to be a significant production partner for Nephila and Nephila will remain a minority shareholder. So I'll finish up with some market commentary. Conditions continue to be favorable and we expect to achieve rate increases in the great majority of our lines as we go through 2022. There is no doubt that after three years and in some cases four years of rate increases it's going to be difficult to continue to average double-digit growth in rates across our portfolio like we did in 2021. Given all the issues that we previously discussed such as goods and services inflation, social inflation and low interest rates we are going to continue to push for rate increases to make sure we can stay ahead of claims trend.  However the specialty insurance market is not one monolithic market. Our underwriting teams will be assessing rate adequacy and market conditions in each of our over 100 specialty lines and we'll adjust our underwriting and pricing strategies accordingly. I think we're entering a more nuanced phase of the market cycle. In some lines where conditions might be more competitive, we could potentially scale back our appetite. While in other lines where we continue to see big opportunities we are going to be full speed ahead. Thank you for your time today. And now I'd like to turn things over to Tom. Jeff, retentions are good. When -- 84%, I think you might be thinking about our net retention after purchases of reinsurance, because I think that's about what that number is. But I mentioned, we have over 100 lines of business and renewal retention in those lines of business that would be a spectrum. I mean, it would be probably anywhere from in the 50% range to the low 90s in some of our books of business in terms of the renewal retention. I think renewal retentions are holding up pretty well right now. Although, it is certainly the case in some of the lines of business where rates were maybe in the fourth year of rate increases and there have been some big rate increases. There's some fatigue creeping in, in terms of the insurance. And as you go through the market cycle, it would not be surprising to see renewable retention start to drop a bit in some of those areas. And that would be things like probably in D&O and some of your financial institution lines, things of that sort. But as of right now, I think we're keeping the accounts we want to keep. We feel good about them. And I think that -- I would expect that later in the market cycle. Yes, absolutely. I think, everybody would say that. I think it's still a great market. I think we're still able to push rate increases. But again after three and in some cases four years of rate increases, you're just not going to be able to maintain double-digit rate increases. The -- I forget what the number was, did I say about $100 million in cat losses in reinsurance for the year. I believe, that number would have been -- assuming we had none of the property that we are running off on risk at the beginning of the year, that had been $10 million or $15 million. Well, if you're talking about -- exposure is growing, obviously. We grew close to almost 20% in 2021. So we have grown exposure on our balance sheet. There's no doubt. At the same time, though, we've achieved double-digit rate increases, roughly 10% rate increase across the book and we've been tightening terms and conditions. So -- and I don't have exact numbers. You'd really have to dig in line by line. But because of just growth, exposures are up, but exposures are not up as much as premium is up because of what we've been doing in terms of rate and terms and conditions. Good morning. We're going to be walking towards that. Obviously, this year, it's very difficult to discern the underlying performance of the ongoing book, because of all the cat losses. But what I can tell you is the underlying go-forward book came in at about a 96% combined this year. And we would expect that to be better in 2022 but probably not all the way to the 90 that is our target. So we'll continue to make progress towards that 90 in 2022, but more likely to get there hopefully in 2023. Yes. I'll be honest, we were a little surprised that where we ended up the year as well, John. And again, I've talked about in the past, and maybe I need to keep talking about each quarter. I mean, your elephant hunting in reinsurance, these are -- when you decide to write an account that can be 30, 40, 50 and more millions of dollars of premium. And so it only takes a couple of elephants to really change what the premium volume is going to look like. So, as we got closer to the end of the year, we saw, just like I said, two or three or four really interesting opportunities in terms of casualty and professional and specialty programs that we decided to write that resulted in the premium that you saw. It's a little difficult to say, but our growth is not our objective in 2022. Profitability is our objective in 2022. And so we're going to continue to be very focused on that. And so while I don't expect growth we're not going to pass on great opportunities if we see them. So I'm going to sit here and tell you more than likely we would expect it to be flattish, but we're not going to pass on great opportunities because we said that we might be flat. Look, we certainly hope to grow but we certainly would not expect or budget for 31% growth. The State National of course, benefited from the same things our underwriting operations are benefiting from which is more rate coming through and more premium moving into the specialty markets. So that helped a lot. But we've got to be realistic as well. Fiber, more years ago there would have been two or three competitors. And at last count I think there were 20-plus competitors in the fronting or hybrid fronting market today. So we're going to have our work cut out for us to grow and that is our goal but certainly don't expect 31%. Roland, honestly our reinsurance buying was pretty consistent, kind of, the form of our programs very similar. I guess, the biggest difference would be we're buying considerably less property reinsurance now, because we reduced property exposure so much. But other than that, it's been pretty steady as she goes. Thank you. Thanks Bruce. That was -- just speaking about reinsurance Bruce, but I will say hey if we catch some breaks, we might could hit the 90% in reinsurance in 2022. But if I talk in terms of the plan we've put together, we will make progress on it from the 96% that that underlying business did this year towards that 90% but not quite get there. And thus I would hope we would definitely be there in 2023. Yeah. That's a really good point that Jeremy makes Bruce. We believe the business we've priced the last three years is pricing up better than a 90% combined. But due to our reserving philosophy, we're going to be -- try to be more likely redundant than deficient. And so we're going to wait and hopefully see that development over time. Absolutely. Yeah. I guess, I would say in 2022, it's a little bit more of the same from 2021. We'd like to continue to grow at a double-digit rate given what -- how we view market conditions right now and we'd like it to be a 90% or better combined ratio at the end of the year. Well, Bruce, we've been working with Hagerty, I think it's going on nine years now. And as many of our partnerships, relationships start, it started with personal relationships between ourselves and Michael [ph] Hagerty and some of his team there. We started out relatively modestly. I think we started working with them on some of their commercial business that comes along with their auto-related business. So, a few million dollars to begin with and then we became their fronting partner and major largest taker of the risk over the next several years. The opportunity came to deepen our partnership back in -- well, I guess we started the discussions in 2018. The opportunity came to deepen our partnership and become part owners minority owners with the Hagerty family. And that transaction was completed in I guess 2019. And then moving forward they saw the need to continue to grow their business. I mean they've grown at double-digit rates that entire time that we've been working with them mid to high teens and they saw the need for capital to continue to grow the business and saw the opportunity through going public to access that capital and also obviously provide some liquidity for the family members. So, it's been a wonderful partnership a wonderful journey with the Hagerty family. And once you go from the private world to the public world and you can get a mark each day that accounts for the difference. Thanks."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Simply put 2021 was a wonderful year for Markel as all three engines; insurance, investments, and Markel Ventures set records and contributed meaningfully towards our efforts to build shareholder value. Total revenues were $12.8 billion and we serve more customers than we ever have before. Starting off with our underwriting operations, gross written premiums were $8.5 billion for the year compared to $7.2 billion in 2020, an increase of 19%. And earned premiums increased 16% to $6.5 billion in 2021. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 84% in 2021 which is up one point from last year. Our consolidated combined ratio for 2021 was in 90 which included $195 million or three points of losses on natural catastrophes including Hurricane Ida, the floods in Europe, and Winter Storm Uri. This compares to a combined ratio of 98 for 2020 which included $358 million or 6 points of losses from COVID-19 and $172 million or 3 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Excluding the loss impacts of catastrophes and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for 2021 was an 87% compared to an 88% for 2020. This improvement reflects a nearly 4-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio, given the benefit of a favorable pricing environment and the impact of underwriting actions taken to enhance our profitability. The impact of these improvements in the combined ratio was largely offset by less favorable prior year development on loss reserves, which totaled $480 million in 2021 compared to $606 million in 2020. Our expense ratio continues to improve, given the benefit of higher net earned premiums and increased efficiency. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains included in net income were just under $2 billion in 2021, compared to $618 million in 2020. In both periods, net investment gains were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. As I've mentioned in prior calls given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $375 million for 2021 compared to $372 million last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. We continue to be diligent with regards to maintaining a high-quality fixed income portfolio, as demonstrated by our average portfolio rating of AAA. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $355 million net of taxes during 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from an increase in interest rates since the end of last year. Now I'll cover the results for our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 30% to $3.6 billion for 2021 compared to $2.8 billion last year. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products, which was acquired in April 2020 and the contribution of revenues from Buckner Heavylift Cranes, which was acquired in August 2021. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our transportation-related businesses and equipment manufacturing businesses, due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic, as well as our consumer building products businesses, given increases in demand reflecting increases in consumer spending in 2021. Our growth in revenues had a more muted impact on the bottom line, as certain of our businesses also saw cost of goods sold increase, which is a reflection of the current economic environment, where supply constraints are contributing to increasing wholesale prices across many industries. With that said, EBITDA from Markel Ventures grew 10% to $403 million for 2021, from $367 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by the increased contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the year, our effective tax rate was 22%. We reported net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion, compared to $798 million last year and comprehensive income to shareholders was $2.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in 2020. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities reached a new high at $2.3 billion for 2021 compared to $1.7 billion for 2020. Operating cash flows for 2021 reflected strong cash flows from our insurance operations, given higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $5.3 billion at the end of the year, up from $4.1 billion at the end of last year. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14.7 billion at December 31, 2021, up 15% from $12.8 billion at the end of last year. During 2021 we repurchased 163,000 common shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program for approximately $200 million. Lastly, I thought I'd provide an update on our investment in Hagerty, the leading specialty insurance provider focused on the global automotive enthusiast market. In December, Hagerty was successful in its efforts to become a publicly listed company. We own 23% of Hagerty through both Class A common shares, which are listed for trading on the NYSE, as well as Class B common shares associated with our original investment in 2019, that can be converted on a one-for-one basis into Class A common shares. For accounting purposes, we are deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Hagerty and therefore account for our investment in Hagerty under the equity method rather than at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investment in Hagerty was $257 million, which was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 the estimated value of our investment based on the closing stock price of Hagerty's Class A common shares was $1.1 billion. I hope that gives a sense of how strong a year Markel had in 2021 by the numbers. We're even more excited about our prospects for 2022. With that I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance businesses. Hey, Mark, it's Jeremy. A couple of comments there. So, you're right. In dollar terms, the favorable prior year loss reserve development was lower year-over-year. A big piece of that as you may have picked up on was within the Reinsurance segment. And I think that's a little bit different as far as considering sort of trend over time. That was -- a lot of that was really kind of what was happening a year ago favorable prior year adjustments on a number of sort of natural catastrophe that's within the property space, and this year a little bit of adverse development relative to kind of COVID and property creating sort of that differentiation. That was the biggest driver. In the insurance book, we were also a little bit lower year-over-year. That primarily comes from lower favorable development on our professional liability lines this year compared to a year ago. Some of that was a few specific larger losses that we recognized on older years. And then I would just suggest that we're going to continue to be quite cautious on the recent accident years as we continue to sort of let time pass and monitor claims frequency and severity trends. So, nothing different as far as loss reserving philosophy, nothing different with regards to the fact that we believe that loss reserves will prove more likely to be redundant and deficient over time. And I don't think there's anything more that I would kind of point to other than that. It is a more complicated analysis than that. You're right that in the accounting rule one of those kind of key presumptions is the 20% ownership. But we also have other sort of commercial relationships and arrangements with Hagerty. We have certain rights that come with the voting interest that we have retained from the original investment we had. So it would not be as simple as if we came in at 19.9% that adjustment would change. Hey, John, it's Jeremy. I'd have to kind of compare that number with you but \u2013 where you picked that up. But we would have meaningful amortization associated with the original acquisition of both State National and Nephila. And we would have a meaningful amount of amortization that would be attributed within Ventures segment associated with the acquisitions of Ventures and then a modest amount of amortization associated with acquisitions we would have made some period of time ago. So I have to kind of cross reference, the exact number you're picking up from where but \u2013 and those numbers when we have operating revenues and operating expenses, if you're looking kind of within the other space, that would exclude the effect of amortization. Hey, John, it's Jeremy. Just to clarify that \u2013 I just see that amortization figure you picked up. That is associated with acquisitions and intangibles associated with acquisitions we made in the insurance or reinsurance space so take for example I'll tear back in 2013 that are attributed to the segments and the segment's underwriting profits don't include amortization. That's just a reconciliation point. Nothing new or different in that space. I think it's also fair to say that the business we're putting on the books now, we believe is priced at we'll hit the 90%, but there's a lag consideration there right? We're going to watch the development as we typically would and that will come through in later years. So again there's a count lag effect but..."

We appreciate the opportunity to connect through this forum, and we look forward to your thoughtful questions. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe that we are already in the final quarter of 2021, but I am happy to report that through 3 quarters, it's been a very good year. All 3 of our operating engines are adding value to Markel and contributing to our efforts to build shareholder value. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums were $6.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $5.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 17%. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines, most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 84% for the first 9 months of 2021, up less than 1 point from the same period last year. Earned premiums increased 15% to $4.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher premium volume in our professional liability and general liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021 was a 91%, which included $182 million or 4 points of losses from natural catastrophes, including Hurricane Ida, the floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri, compared to our combined ratio of 101% for the same period of 2020, which included $372 million or 9 points of losses from COVID-19 and $102 million or 2 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Excluding the loss impacts of catastrophes and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021 was an 87% compared to 90% for the same period in 2020. This improvement reflects a nearly 4-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio, given the benefit of a favorable pricing environment and the impact of underwriting actions taken to enhance our profitability. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $366 million in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $435 million in the first 9 months of 2020. Our expense ratio continues to improve given the benefit of higher net earned premiums and increased efficiency. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains included in net income were $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $231 million in the first 9 months of 2020, which reflected the impact of significant volatility in the equity markets following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $284 million in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $274 million in the same period last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. We continue to be diligent with regards to maintaining a high-quality fixed income portfolio, as demonstrated by our average portfolio rating of AAA. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $266 million net of taxes during the first 9 months of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, partially resulting from an increase in interest rates since the end of last year. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $2 billion for the comparable period last year. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products, which was acquired in April 2020. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our consumer and building products businesses, equipment manufacturing businesses and transportation-related businesses, due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic concepts of disruption caused by the pandemic as well as further increases in demand within our consumer and building products businesses, reflecting increases in consumer spending. Our growth in revenues had a more limited impact on the bottom line, and certain of our businesses saw cost of goods sold increase, which is a reflection of the current economic environment where supply constraints are contributing to increasing wholesale prices across many industries. With that said, EBITDA from Markel Ventures grew 7% to $304 million for the first 9 months of 2021 from $284 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributed to the increased contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the first 9 months of the year. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the first 9 months of 2021. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.5 billion in 2021 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $31 million last year. And comprehensive income to shareholders for the first 9 months 2021 was $1.3 billion compared to $260 million in the 9 months of 2020. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $1.3 billion for the same period last year. Operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2021 reflected the impact of higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $4.8 billion at the end of September this year compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. The increase reflects the proceeds from our May senior note issuance. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of September, up 10% from $12.8 billion at the end of last year. During the first 9 months of this year, we repurchased 101,000 common shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of all 3 of our operating engines during the first 3 quarters of 2021, and we are determined to close the year out with a strong fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. As Jeremy said, with one quarter to go in 2021, we've put ourselves in a position to achieve our profitability and growth goals of a 90% combined ratio and double-digit growth for the year. Through the first 9 months of the year, we achieved a 91% combined ratio, even with significant catastrophe events happening during the year. While our third quarter results were impacted by natural catastrophes, including Hurricane Ida and the European floods, our strategy of reducing our catastrophe exposures enabled us to achieve a 93% combined ratio in the quarter. By transitioning our reinsurance property lines to the ILS market with Nephila, launching the Lodgepine retro fund and strategically purchasing reinsurance, we proactively managed down our exposures to these events and stayed on course to hit our 2021 goals. Regarding growth, we continue to see attractive new business opportunities, coupled with the strong rating environment. This has resulted in significant premium growth in our Insurance segment, producing an impressive 25% growth rate in the third quarter and 20% growth through the first 9 months of the year. Insurance market conditions remain the best we have seen since the last hard market in the early 2000s. Now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So I'll kick it off with the Insurance segment. As I just mentioned, gross written premiums in the Insurance segment for the first 9 months of the year were up 20% over prior year at just under $5.4 billion in total premium writings. Earned premiums were up 16% year-to-date. We continue to see growth across many of our product lines, in particular, within our professional liability, and general liability product lines where we have identified new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations. We continue to see favorable rate environments within most of our insurance product lines and working hard to maximize and capitalize on the current market conditions. The combined ratio for the first 9 months of the year in the Insurance segment was 88% compared to 100% combined last year. The current year combined ratio includes $89 million or 2 points of net losses from the 2021 catastrophe events, while the prior year combined ratio includes $305 million or 9 points of net losses from COVID-19 and $67 million or 2 points of net losses from 2020 cat events. Excluding the impact of catastrophes and COVID-19, the combined ratio decreased by 3 points year-over-year, primarily driven by lower attritional loss ratios in our professional liability, general liability and property product lines, due in part to the benefit from higher premium rates. Turning next to our Reinsurance segment. Let me just quickly recap our transition strategy related to Reinsurance Property business. First, starting January 1 of this year, we successfully transitioned our reinsurance property line from our reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila IOS operations. Second, with the initial capital raise at Lodgepine of July 1 of this year, we have transitioned a little less than half of the underwriting risk of our retro property reinsurance book to our Lodgepine ILS operations. In the future, we plan for a full transition of the retro property book to the IFS model with Markel participating as a minority investor in the fund. We continue to focus on optimizing our profitability within our core casualty, professional liability and specialty reinsurance books, seeking to attain a 90% combined ratio in these products for the long term. Gross written premiums within Reinsurance segment were up 4% at just under $1 billion, and earned premiums were up 12% through the first 9 months of the year. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines from both new business and higher renewals due in part to more favorable rates. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines due to the transition strategies I just discussed. The combined ratio for the first 9 months within the Reinsurance segment was 108% combined versus 106% combined last year. The current year combined ratio included $93 million or 12 points of net losses from 2021 catastrophe events, while the prior year combined ratio included $66 million or 10 points of net losses from COVID-19 and $35 million or 5 points of net losses from 2020 cat events. For the first 9 months of 2021, excluding the impact of catastrophes and COVID-19 losses, the reinsured segment combined ratio increased by 1 point from last year due to lower takedowns of prior year losses, primarily in our property lines, partially offset by a lower attritional loss ratio within our professional liability and general liability lines and a lower expense ratio due to lower comp costs and the impact of higher earned premiums. Next, I'll touch on program services and our ILS operations, both of which I'll just remind you, are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services operations is ceded. We continue to see strong gross written premium volume from our program services operations, with premium volume at State National reaching $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year, resulting in year-to-date production growth of 38%. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. As you would expect, the broader market conditions are also impacting our program services business. The higher rates that are coming through in programs and across various lines of business as well as just growth in program business has led to that 38% growth rate at State National. Fee revenues for the first 9 months of the year were up 15% from a year ago, and the operations continue to produce strong operating contributions to Markel. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of program services opportunities. Next, I'll discuss our Insurance Linked Securities operations. Our ILS operations consist of the results of Nephila and Lodgepine. Lodgepine's impact on the year-to-date ILS results was minimal as the fund only recently launched. For the year, revenues from the ILS operations were up slightly due to continued growth of MGA revenue at Nephila. This was partially offset by lower investment management fees to lower average AUM, assets under management. Assets under management at Nephila were $9.3 billion as of 9/30/2021. The past 5 years of elevated cat activity have been particularly difficult for ILS. Despite these challenges, we continue to identify new areas of opportunities to deploy capital and launch new investment opportunities, both within and outside of the catastrophe market heading into 2022. I'll finish up with just a little bit of market commentary and as always, always happy to talk about that in the questions. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, the insurance market conditions are as good as we've seen since the hard market of the early 2000s. However, this hard market is different from that market and the capital in the current market is plentiful. Drivers of the current market conditions include historically low interest rates, CPI and social inflation trends and loss fatigue in cat-exposed lines of business. Given that these factors are unlikely to resolve in the near future, I believe market conditions will remain favorable throughout 2022, and that's how we're setting up our plans for 2022. We are positioned to end 2021 strong and carry significant momentum into next year. I'd just like to wrap up by thanking all of Markel's employees who worked so hard throughout COVID-19 to produce these outstanding results. With that, thank you. And now I'd like to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. I'm happy to report to you that we earned 5.1% on our investment portfolio during the first 9 months of 2021. That came from returns of 18.1% on our equity portfolio and a loss of 0.5% on our fixed income holdings. I'm delighted with those results. While the results from any one quarter and in fact, any one year or anything less than about 5 years are about 80% noise and 20% substance, it's always more fun to talk about good numbers than bad ones, and those are good numbers. When our accountants hand me the table that displays our returns, the cumulative table at the end shows the investment results that started in 1989. In the 31.75 years that that chart displays, we've earned an annual rate of return of 12.9% on our equity holdings compared to the S&P 500 return of 11.7% and annual returns of 5.9% on our fixed income portfolio for a total return of 7.3%. When you get to 31.75 year time frames, I would argue that the noise fades away and that you're left with substantive fundamentals. That is what matters to us, and I hope you are pleased with those results. Our process which produced them remains unchanged. My only commentary about investment markets is that we continue to see pockets of opportunity. We continue to purchase additional stakes in publicly traded businesses. We're following the same discipline and Markel benefits from the ability to regularly dollar cost average into our holdings. Positive cash flows from both our insurance and ventures operations create this advantage. As to Markel Ventures, I keep using the same 2 words I've used since the start of the pandemic, I am grateful and amazed for the work and the results of our operations. On the top line, revenues grew 35% from $2 billion to $2.7 billion. Our EBITDA grew 7% from $284 million to $304 million through the first 9 months. As is the case with the volatility that normally occurs in our investment operations, Markel Ventures profitability will rise and fall when you look at any short-term period versus period comparison. The group has consistently produced double-digit EBITDA profitability since its inception in 2005, and I fully expect that to continue to be the case. Part of my gratitude and amazement at the performance of Markel Ventures comes from what I see on a daily basis. The work our leaders are doing to manage supply chain disruptions, COVID protocols, labor issues, transportation bottlenecks and countless other issues is simply amazing. I cannot thank the teams enough for the work they are doing. I hope you share my pride in their accomplishments. I'm also very pleased to let you know that we welcomed Buckner Heavylift Cranes into the Markel Ventures family during the quarter. Several years ago, one of our great shareholders, Mark Hughes, from Lafayette Investments, made an interesting observation about one of our acquisitions. After he did some independent research and found some things out about the company we'd acquired, he said, \"Congratulations for buying another leading company in an industry I didn't know existed.\" Buckner fits that category as it owns one of the largest fleets in the world of heavy lift cranes. When you're lifting 300 to 1,000 tons, as the Buckner fleet does, you can't do it online or from far away. You must be there, and you need to know what you're doing. Buckner is a fourth-generation family business, and that speaks volumes about the durability and forever mindset upon which we've built Markel over generations. We're excited to welcome Buckner to Markel, and we're honored that they have chosen to join us. As we've said in the last few years, it's hard to find new businesses for Markel Ventures, given the pricing environment, but we've been able to do so because some companies crave our long-term focus and meet us in the middle to become part of this company. We're grateful for those opportunities, and we'll continue to try and make the most of them. Finally, I'll conclude with the observation that the ongoing growth you're seeing in every dimension of Markel is taking place while we're repurchasing shares at the same time. You're getting more company in fewer shares. And as a Markel shareholder myself, I think that ought to work out for the best over time. With that, we'd now be delighted to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Hughes of Truist.\nMark Hughes: Yes. This is the other Mark Hughes. Could you talk about the growth in the insurance business? This nice acceleration in written premiums, I think you talked about the good market conditions. Is it that the market conditions are getting better? Or you're rolling out the new products, focusing on new lines that are helping you to grow the top line more quickly?\nRichie Whitt: Mark, it's Richie. In terms of the market, it was interesting. We sort of hit another gear in the third quarter. And as you saw, that was that's been our highest growth rate quarter of the year. One quarter doesn't make a trend. We'll see what fourth quarter looks like. But we had quite a bit of success in the third quarter. And it felt like more of the same. There were probably a few big policies in there and things of that sort. But I know people have been talking about rate increases and sort of crested and they were starting to come off. And I agree with that assessment, but it felt like in the third quarter, the market gained back a little bit of momentum. And I don't know if this is the case, but I tend to put some of it to the cat events in the third quarter. I think that probably damaged some people's earnings for the year after some -- after a year last year that was somewhat disappointing. And so I think some of the cat losses, and I think some of the concern around inflation and then social inflation, I think all of that might have tipped in some people's resolve because we felt we felt like the third quarter, we saw a little bit of a shift. We saw a little bit more momentum in the third quarter. We'll see how fourth quarter goes.\nMark Hughes: Yes, Interesting. On Hagerty, what is the latest thinking in terms of potential book value impact? And what would be the timing of that impact on book?\nJeremy Noble: Mark, it's Jeremy. We kind of have to finalize. I mean, obviously, first off, Hagerty actually has to go through sort of the listing. But as and when they do, we account for our investment in Hagerty on the equity method of accounting. And that won't change because of that percentage ownership we have in Hagerty. So that sort of mark-to-market, even though it's publicly listed will not be reflected directly in the book value. It would be more of an unrealized gain, if you will. There is some accounting noise that we'll work through once the deal is listed because of the aspect of being an investor in the pipe because of the aspect of some of the dilution that's created under the transaction, and all of that will get reported within our financial statement as and when that deal closes. But the main thing I would caution you right now is in accounting and GAAP's infinite wisdom, it would not appear that that would be a mark-to-market relative to the fair value and the valuation of Hagerty.\nMark Hughes: Okay. And then how about the workers' comp line, I'll ask that, just trying to figure out if that's hitting any sort of inflection? Does it look more attractive, less attractive to you? Are you seeing a little bit of rate there, just a update would be great?\nRichie Whitt: Workers' comp has been stubbornly flat to slightly down. We're still tracking rates 0% to 3% down in terms of the workers' comp market. So I mean, it is one of the very few lines I can think of that really have not reacted in the current market. In fairness, results have been very good in workers' comp. And the impact that people feared from COVID, at least to this point, has not manifested. So I would say at current pricing, we're cautious in terms of workers' compensation. We -- because rates have been going down, not hugely, but rates have been going down for a few years now, and we've all seen workers' comp can move very quickly. It can move very quickly to unprofitability. It can move very quickly to profitability. So we're going to keep an eye on it right now and recognize that it is almost the only outlier from what has been increasing rates and better terms in other lines.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Fox of Fenimore Asset Management.\nJohn Fox: Terrific results. A couple of questions for Richie. Richie, could you talk about the Reinsurance segment? The cat losses were, on a dollar basis, about the same, September this year and last year, a little bit less percentage-wise. Could you just kind of level set how is this third quarter cat for the industry versus last year? I know we had Hurricane Ida, but I'm not remembering how significant it was last year.\nRichie Whitt: Right, John. Well, what I would tell you, and I think this is worth focusing on is the only business -- when we talk about our Reinsurance Property business that was transferred over to Nephila, the only thing that's left is multiyear policies that are going to take a couple of more -- well, the are going to runoff -- pretty much will be completely run off by the end of next year. So the reality is we were out of that business at January 1. We didn't write anything new, but we had some policies, and they tended to be large that were run off. And so they were hit. Some of them were hit in Yuri, some of them were hit with Ida. After next year, you wouldn't expect those losses. We wouldn't expect to see those losses because that book has moved. On the retro side, again, we're only about halfway moved into the ILS model. And of course, we will take some portion of that back, a minority position in that back through investment results. But we're kind of midway through that transition. And so once we complete that transition activity from any kind of cat losses on the retro book would show up through investment results. So I can't remember what the number is. I think it was whatever it was and in reinsurance, that number next year, if we complete the transitions, you wouldn't expect to see much of any cap number -- it was $93 million, I guess, for the 9 months. You wouldn't expect to see much of anything next year as we have transitioned both of those to an ILS model.\nJeremy Noble: John, it's Jeremy. Just to jump in as well. Last year, to Richie's point, we would not have had any losses come through on the retro book. So that's a difference in the quarter when you're looking at that $68 million versus $70 million kind of flattish. This year would have had retro losses, last year wouldn't know. So -- and actually, probably the better part of sort of 2/3 of that loss is kind of more on the retro side versus the globally runoff. So you would see a little bit like-for-like, lower losses this year than last year in the quarter.\nRichie Whitt: Yes, last year was a clean year for Retro, John. This year, both the European floods and Ida are of a size that they will get into people's retro programs.\nJohn Fox: Okay. And you did indicate in the Q that there was a tail on summaries. And can you talk about ILS. I know you press released on a settlement with CATCo with those funds. Are there any expenses in the ILS segment related to that? Or is this really the run rate in terms of revenue and expense relationship that we see in the third quarter.\nRichie Whitt: So the -- any potential the expenses from that potential transaction, we said in the press releases, Markel is going to fund the return of investors' capital, that could be up to $270 million. We would get that money back over time as the reserves settle out. We think that's over the next couple of years. And then we were also adding, for the benefit of investors, a payment of about $75 million. When the transaction closes, after it gets all of its investor and court approvals, at that point, that would crystallize, and Markel would recognize the $75 million in expenses. So this quarter, none of that's in this quarter because it hasn't closed yet. And so expenses you're seeing right now, they're rough -- I would say roughly runway, right? Can you think of anything...\nJeremy Noble: Yes, there to be a little bit of sort of professional fees associated with that transaction. But to Richie's point, the main payment to and for the benefit of investors, that $75 million, that would be recognized once the process is further completed through the courts and with the investors.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Scott Heleniak of RBC.\nScott Heleniak: I wonder if you could touch on where your rate increases are now versus average loss trends? And Richie, I know you made a comment about -- you sound pretty bullish on kind of where rates are heading into 2022. And just wondering if you are sort of expecting rate increases to outpace loss cost inflation for next year too? It sounds like you're pretty optimistic about what you're seeing, but if you could comment further on that.\nRichie Whitt: Sure, Scott. Yes, I am optimistic about that. We're averaging through the third quarter, about 10% rate increases, and that differs widely by line of business. You'd see much higher rate increases in casualty and professional liability, you'd see much lower rate increases in personal lines and some of your smaller retail sorts of lines. But overall, through the first 9 months, we averaged about 10%. I absolutely believe that's ahead of trend, but the caveat there is, I don't think any of us can know with certainty what trend is. We know we've got a little back bounce of inflation right now. We also know that the pendulum is always swinging in terms of social inflation, and it seems to be swinging towards more social inflation right now. So I think trend is more, but I don't know exactly what it is. And unfortunately, in insurance, you don't know what it is until years later. I think we have a decent margin against trend right now. But my message to my underwriters is we know trend is more than it was. And so we need to keep our foot on the gas in terms of rates and terms to make sure we maintain a margin against that trend. And I am optimistic in 2022 that we can continue to do that. I think rates are still justified and needed in the market. And so in '22, I hope we continue to see nice rate increases.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's helpful. I definitely appreciate the -- we definitely can't predict what's going to happen with pricing and certainly with loss cost inflation, but it sounds like you have a margin safety in there.\nRichie Whitt: It feels like it.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. And then just switching gears, the reserve releases, I wonder if you could give a little more detail on that, just for the quarter. I know you mentioned 9 months, they're pretty significant, but wondering if there's sort of where those are coming from and if there's any additions or offsets to those in either unit? Or it's just consistent with the first half of the year?\nJeremy Noble: Scott, it's pretty consistent. I mean, again, it's the same lines that are driving it predominantly, particularly in the insurance space where the most prior year takedowns would be. So looking at general liability, professional liability, workers' comp and property lines. So in the quarter, pretty similar to the trend for the year.\nRichie Whitt: Apparently, there's new news, if you will, with regards to the favorable prior year losses.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. got it. And then -- go ahead, did you -- were you going to say something?\nTom Gayner: No, no. That's fine, Scott. Go ahead.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. And just wondering on the cat loss, you gave the cat loss number for the quarter. And wondering if you could break that out, what Ida was versus European floods? Are you willing to be able to do that? Just so we could get a size of those losses, what those were?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, we didn't quantify exactly. But what I would tell you is that quarter-to-date, you can go to roughly a 70% Ida, 30% European floods. I mean European floods would predominantly feature in the property retro book.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's helpful. Okay. And then lastly, just on the ventures, I know you mentioned supply chain raw material costs, a lot of companies, a lot of industries are facing that and obviously impacted profitability. But is there any particular business that you can highlight where it's having the biggest impact? And do you expect to see similar pressures in Q4 and 2022? Just any more detail on kind of what's going on there?\nTom Gayner: Yes, there's good news about is that the and the sort of same thing is both good news and bad news. I would say it's across the board. So inflationary pressures exist in pretty much any business that I'm aware of, whether it's the insurance business, whether it's any of the Markel Venture businesses, whether it's the companies we invest in. You're just seeing it everywhere because to the extent you use people or you use stuff, price for both are going up. Now one of the advantages we have through the Markel Ventures business, particularly, is that the feedback loops are pretty quick. We're not expending a huge capital item to build some huge facility. And then using that for 20 years and then being surprised at how much it costs to build a new one. You get daily feedback of what your costs are and a pretty quick feedback loop. And so there's oftentimes a time lag between being able to get a customer to accept a price increase for what you're seeing on the input cost side, and that's what you're seeing in this particular quarter. But every person running those businesses is asking and receiving price increases from their customers because the cost of everything is going up.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Got it, that makes sense. And then -- so the -- so is the run rate we're seeing wasn't impacted by anything onetime? Or this is just kind of the new cost doing business, right? Just...\nTom Gayner: There's some minor puts and takes of things that would have happened last year and this year, but that's also why I've made the distinction and point about separating substance from the noise. If you look at it on a multiyear basis, the growth and the consistent profitability of Markel Ventures is there, and there's nothing that I'm concerned about that would disrupt that.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much, and we wish everybody a happy upcoming holiday season. Be well.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you. This is indeed Tom Gayner, and it is my privilege to welcome you to the third quarter update call for Markel. Markel operates as a long-term organization with the preferred time horizon of infinity. We're all dedicated to the idea of building one of the world's great companies, and we mean to do it forever. We're doing this as a public company. And as so, we file quarterly financial statements every 90 days. In accordance with that cadence, we host this call where we try to update you, our business partners, with updated quarterly financial information. We also try to share some comments and context on current conditions in our businesses and thoughts on what we're working on these days. I'm joined this morning by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. Jeremy will speak to the overall results for the first 9 months of 2021. Richie will then update us on our insurance, reinsurance and ILS operations, and then I'll return with a few comments about our investment activities and our Markel Ventures operations. After that, we'll open the floor for your questions. We deeply appreciate you, our shareholders, and the long-term partnership and shared sense of purpose that we have with you. We appreciate the opportunity to connect through this forum, and we look forward to your thoughtful questions. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy. Thank you, Richie. I'm happy to report to you that we earned 5.1% on our investment portfolio during the first 9 months of 2021. That came from returns of 18.1% on our equity portfolio and a loss of 0.5% on our fixed income holdings. I'm delighted with those results. While the results from any one quarter and in fact, any one year or anything less than about 5 years are about 80% noise and 20% substance, it's always more fun to talk about good numbers than bad ones, and those are good numbers. When our accountants hand me the table that displays our returns, the cumulative table at the end shows the investment results that started in 1989. In the 31.75 years that that chart displays, we've earned an annual rate of return of 12.9% on our equity holdings compared to the S&P 500 return of 11.7% and annual returns of 5.9% on our fixed income portfolio for a total return of 7.3%. When you get to 31.75 year time frames, I would argue that the noise fades away and that you're left with substantive fundamentals. That is what matters to us, and I hope you are pleased with those results. Our process which produced them remains unchanged. My only commentary about investment markets is that we continue to see pockets of opportunity. We continue to purchase additional stakes in publicly traded businesses. We're following the same discipline and Markel benefits from the ability to regularly dollar cost average into our holdings. Positive cash flows from both our insurance and ventures operations create this advantage. As to Markel Ventures, I keep using the same 2 words I've used since the start of the pandemic, I am grateful and amazed for the work and the results of our operations. On the top line, revenues grew 35% from $2 billion to $2.7 billion. Our EBITDA grew 7% from $284 million to $304 million through the first 9 months. As is the case with the volatility that normally occurs in our investment operations, Markel Ventures profitability will rise and fall when you look at any short-term period versus period comparison. The group has consistently produced double-digit EBITDA profitability since its inception in 2005, and I fully expect that to continue to be the case. Part of my gratitude and amazement at the performance of Markel Ventures comes from what I see on a daily basis. The work our leaders are doing to manage supply chain disruptions, COVID protocols, labor issues, transportation bottlenecks and countless other issues is simply amazing. I cannot thank the teams enough for the work they are doing. I hope you share my pride in their accomplishments. I'm also very pleased to let you know that we welcomed Buckner Heavylift Cranes into the Markel Ventures family during the quarter. Several years ago, one of our great shareholders, Mark Hughes, from Lafayette Investments, made an interesting observation about one of our acquisitions. After he did some independent research and found some things out about the company we'd acquired, he said, \"Congratulations for buying another leading company in an industry I didn't know existed.\" Buckner fits that category as it owns one of the largest fleets in the world of heavy lift cranes. When you're lifting 300 to 1,000 tons, as the Buckner fleet does, you can't do it online or from far away. You must be there, and you need to know what you're doing. Buckner is a fourth-generation family business, and that speaks volumes about the durability and forever mindset upon which we've built Markel over generations. We're excited to welcome Buckner to Markel, and we're honored that they have chosen to join us. As we've said in the last few years, it's hard to find new businesses for Markel Ventures, given the pricing environment, but we've been able to do so because some companies crave our long-term focus and meet us in the middle to become part of this company. We're grateful for those opportunities, and we'll continue to try and make the most of them. Finally, I'll conclude with the observation that the ongoing growth you're seeing in every dimension of Markel is taking place while we're repurchasing shares at the same time. You're getting more company in fewer shares. And as a Markel shareholder myself, I think that ought to work out for the best over time. With that, we'd now be delighted to answer your questions. No, no. That's fine, Scott. Go ahead. Yes, there's good news about is that the and the sort of same thing is both good news and bad news. I would say it's across the board. So inflationary pressures exist in pretty much any business that I'm aware of, whether it's the insurance business, whether it's any of the Markel Venture businesses, whether it's the companies we invest in. You're just seeing it everywhere because to the extent you use people or you use stuff, price for both are going up. Now one of the advantages we have through the Markel Ventures business, particularly, is that the feedback loops are pretty quick. We're not expending a huge capital item to build some huge facility. And then using that for 20 years and then being surprised at how much it costs to build a new one. You get daily feedback of what your costs are and a pretty quick feedback loop. And so there's oftentimes a time lag between being able to get a customer to accept a price increase for what you're seeing on the input cost side, and that's what you're seeing in this particular quarter. But every person running those businesses is asking and receiving price increases from their customers because the cost of everything is going up. There's some minor puts and takes of things that would have happened last year and this year, but that's also why I've made the distinction and point about separating substance from the noise. If you look at it on a multiyear basis, the growth and the consistent profitability of Markel Ventures is there, and there's nothing that I'm concerned about that would disrupt that. Thank you very much, and we wish everybody a happy upcoming holiday season. Be well."

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. As Jeremy said, with one quarter to go in 2021, we've put ourselves in a position to achieve our profitability and growth goals of a 90% combined ratio and double-digit growth for the year. Through the first 9 months of the year, we achieved a 91% combined ratio, even with significant catastrophe events happening during the year. While our third quarter results were impacted by natural catastrophes, including Hurricane Ida and the European floods, our strategy of reducing our catastrophe exposures enabled us to achieve a 93% combined ratio in the quarter. By transitioning our reinsurance property lines to the ILS market with Nephila, launching the Lodgepine retro fund and strategically purchasing reinsurance, we proactively managed down our exposures to these events and stayed on course to hit our 2021 goals. Regarding growth, we continue to see attractive new business opportunities, coupled with the strong rating environment. This has resulted in significant premium growth in our Insurance segment, producing an impressive 25% growth rate in the third quarter and 20% growth through the first 9 months of the year. Insurance market conditions remain the best we have seen since the last hard market in the early 2000s. Now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So I'll kick it off with the Insurance segment. As I just mentioned, gross written premiums in the Insurance segment for the first 9 months of the year were up 20% over prior year at just under $5.4 billion in total premium writings. Earned premiums were up 16% year-to-date. We continue to see growth across many of our product lines, in particular, within our professional liability, and general liability product lines where we have identified new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations. We continue to see favorable rate environments within most of our insurance product lines and working hard to maximize and capitalize on the current market conditions. The combined ratio for the first 9 months of the year in the Insurance segment was 88% compared to 100% combined last year. The current year combined ratio includes $89 million or 2 points of net losses from the 2021 catastrophe events, while the prior year combined ratio includes $305 million or 9 points of net losses from COVID-19 and $67 million or 2 points of net losses from 2020 cat events. Excluding the impact of catastrophes and COVID-19, the combined ratio decreased by 3 points year-over-year, primarily driven by lower attritional loss ratios in our professional liability, general liability and property product lines, due in part to the benefit from higher premium rates. Turning next to our Reinsurance segment. Let me just quickly recap our transition strategy related to Reinsurance Property business. First, starting January 1 of this year, we successfully transitioned our reinsurance property line from our reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila IOS operations. Second, with the initial capital raise at Lodgepine of July 1 of this year, we have transitioned a little less than half of the underwriting risk of our retro property reinsurance book to our Lodgepine ILS operations. In the future, we plan for a full transition of the retro property book to the IFS model with Markel participating as a minority investor in the fund. We continue to focus on optimizing our profitability within our core casualty, professional liability and specialty reinsurance books, seeking to attain a 90% combined ratio in these products for the long term. Gross written premiums within Reinsurance segment were up 4% at just under $1 billion, and earned premiums were up 12% through the first 9 months of the year. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines from both new business and higher renewals due in part to more favorable rates. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines due to the transition strategies I just discussed. The combined ratio for the first 9 months within the Reinsurance segment was 108% combined versus 106% combined last year. The current year combined ratio included $93 million or 12 points of net losses from 2021 catastrophe events, while the prior year combined ratio included $66 million or 10 points of net losses from COVID-19 and $35 million or 5 points of net losses from 2020 cat events. For the first 9 months of 2021, excluding the impact of catastrophes and COVID-19 losses, the reinsured segment combined ratio increased by 1 point from last year due to lower takedowns of prior year losses, primarily in our property lines, partially offset by a lower attritional loss ratio within our professional liability and general liability lines and a lower expense ratio due to lower comp costs and the impact of higher earned premiums. Next, I'll touch on program services and our ILS operations, both of which I'll just remind you, are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services operations is ceded. We continue to see strong gross written premium volume from our program services operations, with premium volume at State National reaching $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of the year, resulting in year-to-date production growth of 38%. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. As you would expect, the broader market conditions are also impacting our program services business. The higher rates that are coming through in programs and across various lines of business as well as just growth in program business has led to that 38% growth rate at State National. Fee revenues for the first 9 months of the year were up 15% from a year ago, and the operations continue to produce strong operating contributions to Markel. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of program services opportunities. Next, I'll discuss our Insurance Linked Securities operations. Our ILS operations consist of the results of Nephila and Lodgepine. Lodgepine's impact on the year-to-date ILS results was minimal as the fund only recently launched. For the year, revenues from the ILS operations were up slightly due to continued growth of MGA revenue at Nephila. This was partially offset by lower investment management fees to lower average AUM, assets under management. Assets under management at Nephila were $9.3 billion as of 9/30/2021. The past 5 years of elevated cat activity have been particularly difficult for ILS. Despite these challenges, we continue to identify new areas of opportunities to deploy capital and launch new investment opportunities, both within and outside of the catastrophe market heading into 2022. I'll finish up with just a little bit of market commentary and as always, always happy to talk about that in the questions. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, the insurance market conditions are as good as we've seen since the hard market of the early 2000s. However, this hard market is different from that market and the capital in the current market is plentiful. Drivers of the current market conditions include historically low interest rates, CPI and social inflation trends and loss fatigue in cat-exposed lines of business. Given that these factors are unlikely to resolve in the near future, I believe market conditions will remain favorable throughout 2022, and that's how we're setting up our plans for 2022. We are positioned to end 2021 strong and carry significant momentum into next year. I'd just like to wrap up by thanking all of Markel's employees who worked so hard throughout COVID-19 to produce these outstanding results. With that, thank you. And now I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Mark, it's Richie. In terms of the market, it was interesting. We sort of hit another gear in the third quarter. And as you saw, that was that's been our highest growth rate quarter of the year. One quarter doesn't make a trend. We'll see what fourth quarter looks like. But we had quite a bit of success in the third quarter. And it felt like more of the same. There were probably a few big policies in there and things of that sort. But I know people have been talking about rate increases and sort of crested and they were starting to come off. And I agree with that assessment, but it felt like in the third quarter, the market gained back a little bit of momentum. And I don't know if this is the case, but I tend to put some of it to the cat events in the third quarter. I think that probably damaged some people's earnings for the year after some -- after a year last year that was somewhat disappointing. And so I think some of the cat losses, and I think some of the concern around inflation and then social inflation, I think all of that might have tipped in some people's resolve because we felt we felt like the third quarter, we saw a little bit of a shift. We saw a little bit more momentum in the third quarter. We'll see how fourth quarter goes. Workers' comp has been stubbornly flat to slightly down. We're still tracking rates 0% to 3% down in terms of the workers' comp market. So I mean, it is one of the very few lines I can think of that really have not reacted in the current market. In fairness, results have been very good in workers' comp. And the impact that people feared from COVID, at least to this point, has not manifested. So I would say at current pricing, we're cautious in terms of workers' compensation. We -- because rates have been going down, not hugely, but rates have been going down for a few years now, and we've all seen workers' comp can move very quickly. It can move very quickly to unprofitability. It can move very quickly to profitability. So we're going to keep an eye on it right now and recognize that it is almost the only outlier from what has been increasing rates and better terms in other lines. Right, John. Well, what I would tell you, and I think this is worth focusing on is the only business -- when we talk about our Reinsurance Property business that was transferred over to Nephila, the only thing that's left is multiyear policies that are going to take a couple of more -- well, the are going to runoff -- pretty much will be completely run off by the end of next year. So the reality is we were out of that business at January 1. We didn't write anything new, but we had some policies, and they tended to be large that were run off. And so they were hit. Some of them were hit in Yuri, some of them were hit with Ida. After next year, you wouldn't expect those losses. We wouldn't expect to see those losses because that book has moved. On the retro side, again, we're only about halfway moved into the ILS model. And of course, we will take some portion of that back, a minority position in that back through investment results. But we're kind of midway through that transition. And so once we complete that transition activity from any kind of cat losses on the retro book would show up through investment results. So I can't remember what the number is. I think it was whatever it was and in reinsurance, that number next year, if we complete the transitions, you wouldn't expect to see much of any cap number -- it was $93 million, I guess, for the 9 months. You wouldn't expect to see much of anything next year as we have transitioned both of those to an ILS model. Yes, last year was a clean year for Retro, John. This year, both the European floods and Ida are of a size that they will get into people's retro programs. So the -- any potential the expenses from that potential transaction, we said in the press releases, Markel is going to fund the return of investors' capital, that could be up to $270 million. We would get that money back over time as the reserves settle out. We think that's over the next couple of years. And then we were also adding, for the benefit of investors, a payment of about $75 million. When the transaction closes, after it gets all of its investor and court approvals, at that point, that would crystallize, and Markel would recognize the $75 million in expenses. So this quarter, none of that's in this quarter because it hasn't closed yet. And so expenses you're seeing right now, they're rough -- I would say roughly runway, right? Can you think of anything... Sure, Scott. Yes, I am optimistic about that. We're averaging through the third quarter, about 10% rate increases, and that differs widely by line of business. You'd see much higher rate increases in casualty and professional liability, you'd see much lower rate increases in personal lines and some of your smaller retail sorts of lines. But overall, through the first 9 months, we averaged about 10%. I absolutely believe that's ahead of trend, but the caveat there is, I don't think any of us can know with certainty what trend is. We know we've got a little back bounce of inflation right now. We also know that the pendulum is always swinging in terms of social inflation, and it seems to be swinging towards more social inflation right now. So I think trend is more, but I don't know exactly what it is. And unfortunately, in insurance, you don't know what it is until years later. I think we have a decent margin against trend right now. But my message to my underwriters is we know trend is more than it was. And so we need to keep our foot on the gas in terms of rates and terms to make sure we maintain a margin against that trend. And I am optimistic in 2022 that we can continue to do that. I think rates are still justified and needed in the market. And so in '22, I hope we continue to see nice rate increases. It feels like it. Apparently, there's new news, if you will, with regards to the favorable prior year losses."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. It's hard to believe that we are already in the final quarter of 2021, but I am happy to report that through 3 quarters, it's been a very good year. All 3 of our operating engines are adding value to Markel and contributing to our efforts to build shareholder value. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums were $6.3 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $5.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 17%. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines, most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 84% for the first 9 months of 2021, up less than 1 point from the same period last year. Earned premiums increased 15% to $4.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher premium volume in our professional liability and general liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021 was a 91%, which included $182 million or 4 points of losses from natural catastrophes, including Hurricane Ida, the floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri, compared to our combined ratio of 101% for the same period of 2020, which included $372 million or 9 points of losses from COVID-19 and $102 million or 2 points of losses from natural catastrophes. Excluding the loss impacts of catastrophes and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first 9 months of 2021 was an 87% compared to 90% for the same period in 2020. This improvement reflects a nearly 4-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio, given the benefit of a favorable pricing environment and the impact of underwriting actions taken to enhance our profitability. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $366 million in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $435 million in the first 9 months of 2020. Our expense ratio continues to improve given the benefit of higher net earned premiums and increased efficiency. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains included in net income were $1.2 billion in the first 9 months of 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $231 million in the first 9 months of 2020, which reflected the impact of significant volatility in the equity markets following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $284 million in the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $274 million in the same period last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. We continue to be diligent with regards to maintaining a high-quality fixed income portfolio, as demonstrated by our average portfolio rating of AAA. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $266 million net of taxes during the first 9 months of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, partially resulting from an increase in interest rates since the end of last year. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $2.7 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $2 billion for the comparable period last year. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products, which was acquired in April 2020. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our consumer and building products businesses, equipment manufacturing businesses and transportation-related businesses, due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic concepts of disruption caused by the pandemic as well as further increases in demand within our consumer and building products businesses, reflecting increases in consumer spending. Our growth in revenues had a more limited impact on the bottom line, and certain of our businesses saw cost of goods sold increase, which is a reflection of the current economic environment where supply constraints are contributing to increasing wholesale prices across many industries. With that said, EBITDA from Markel Ventures grew 7% to $304 million for the first 9 months of 2021 from $284 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase is primarily attributed to the increased contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the first 9 months of the year. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the first 9 months of 2021. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.5 billion in 2021 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $31 million last year. And comprehensive income to shareholders for the first 9 months 2021 was $1.3 billion compared to $260 million in the 9 months of 2020. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for the first 9 months of 2021 compared to $1.3 billion for the same period last year. Operating cash flows for the first 9 months of 2021 reflected the impact of higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $4.8 billion at the end of September this year compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. The increase reflects the proceeds from our May senior note issuance. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of September, up 10% from $12.8 billion at the end of last year. During the first 9 months of this year, we repurchased 101,000 common shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of all 3 of our operating engines during the first 3 quarters of 2021, and we are determined to close the year out with a strong fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses. Mark, it's Jeremy. We kind of have to finalize. I mean, obviously, first off, Hagerty actually has to go through sort of the listing. But as and when they do, we account for our investment in Hagerty on the equity method of accounting. And that won't change because of that percentage ownership we have in Hagerty. So that sort of mark-to-market, even though it's publicly listed will not be reflected directly in the book value. It would be more of an unrealized gain, if you will. There is some accounting noise that we'll work through once the deal is listed because of the aspect of being an investor in the pipe because of the aspect of some of the dilution that's created under the transaction, and all of that will get reported within our financial statement as and when that deal closes. But the main thing I would caution you right now is in accounting and GAAP's infinite wisdom, it would not appear that that would be a mark-to-market relative to the fair value and the valuation of Hagerty. John, it's Jeremy. Just to jump in as well. Last year, to Richie's point, we would not have had any losses come through on the retro book. So that's a difference in the quarter when you're looking at that $68 million versus $70 million kind of flattish. This year would have had retro losses, last year wouldn't know. So -- and actually, probably the better part of sort of 2/3 of that loss is kind of more on the retro side versus the globally runoff. So you would see a little bit like-for-like, lower losses this year than last year in the quarter. Yes, there to be a little bit of sort of professional fees associated with that transaction. But to Richie's point, the main payment to and for the benefit of investors, that $75 million, that would be recognized once the process is further completed through the courts and with the investors. Scott, it's pretty consistent. I mean, again, it's the same lines that are driving it predominantly, particularly in the insurance space where the most prior year takedowns would be. So looking at general liability, professional liability, workers' comp and property lines. So in the quarter, pretty similar to the trend for the year. Yes, we didn't quantify exactly. But what I would tell you is that quarter-to-date, you can go to roughly a 70% Ida, 30% European floods. I mean European floods would predominantly feature in the property retro book."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Good morning and thank you. Welcome to the Markel Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined this morning by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO Jeremy Noble. Our goal as always is to provide you with some insights on how things are going here at Markel and to answer any questions you have about your business. I'm especially pleased to offer today's report. I've now been at Markel for 30.5 years. That means its quarter number 122. Frankly, some quarters are better than others and this is one of those quarters that's better. As such, it's fun to be able to share this report with you. The headline is that all three engines of Markel performed well and provided great thrust in the first half of 2021. The even better news is that none of the engines red lined to get there. People are working hard and the financial outcomes reflect their excellent, as well as hard work. But these are the sorts of results that Markel can and should produce over long periods of time. We've got an insurance business, producing solid underwriting profits and growing at the same time. We've got a collection of unique and wonderful businesses in our Markel Ventures operations that produced excellent financial results and they're growing. And we've got an investment operation that protects the financial underpinning of Markel and earned strong financial results at the same time. These outcomes, flow directly from the underlying values, held by the people of Markel. As an organization, we are dedicated to serving our customers, our fellow associates and our shareholders, who provide us with the capital to operate this business. Our structure as we continue to work to build one of the world's great companies is truly win, win, win, and we're delighted to share the first half report card with you and the good marks in all the subjects. We know that winning over time is a long-term gain. One quarter, 1/2 of the year, do not begin to describe or justify what we are trying to do. But in order to win a national championship, you do have to win some individual games along the way. This quarter and the first half are just a few games. We know that we have and will continue to lose a few games along the way, but the long-term results should not get us relegated. More importantly, we're excited about our prospects and the actions we've taken as managers to improve the likelihood that will continue to produce excellent results over time. Thank you for your ongoing support and confidence as we've done so. We appreciate that more than you can imagine, and we look forward to your thoughtful questions. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeremy, who will review the financial results from the first half. Richie will then discuss our insurance operations and then I'll come back with a few comments on our ventures and investment engines. Following that, we will open the floor for questions. Jeremy?\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom referenced, we are halfway through the year and are very pleased with the outstanding performance across each of our three operating engines as our Insurance, Investments, and Ventures operations each contributed meaningfully to our efforts to build shareholder value. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $4.3 billion for the first half of 2021 compared to $3.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 15%. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines, most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 85% for the first half of 2021, which is up one point from the same period last year primarily driven by changes in the mix of business within our Reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 14% to $3.1 billion in the first half of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher written premium volume within our professional liability and general liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2021 was a 90% which included $68 million or two points of losses on Winter Storm Uri. This compares to a 103% combined ratio for the same period last year, which included 12 points of losses from COVID-19. Excluding the loss impacts of Winter Storm Uri and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2021 was an 88% compared to 91% for the same period of 2020. This improvement reflects a four-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and a one and a half point improvement in our expense ratio, which were partially offset by a lower benefit from prior year loss reserve releases. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $226 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $268 million in the first half of 2020. Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included a net income of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $770 million in the first half of 2020, which reflected the impact of significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio in the first quarter of 2020, driven by the unfavorable market value movements, resulting from the onset of the pandemic followed by a partial recovery in the second quarter of 2020. As I mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $193 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $184 million in the same period last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. Net unrealized investment gains decreased by $162 million net of taxes during the first half of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from an overall increase in the interest rates since the end of the year. Now, I'll cover the results for our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $1.8 billion for the first half of 2021 compared to $1.2 billion for the comparable period a year ago. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products which was acquired in April of 2020. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our consumer and building products businesses, equipment manufacturing businesses, and transportation-related businesses due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic as well as further increases in demand within our consumer and building products businesses, reflecting increases in consumer spending. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $220 million for the first half of 2021 compared to $173 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase is attributed to increased sales volumes and a more significant contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was at 21% for both 2021 and 2020. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.3 billion in this year compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $484 million last year. And comprehensive income to shareholders for the first half of this year was $1.2 billion compared to a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $260 million in the first half a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $813 million for the first half of 2021 compared to $489 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in the first half of this year reflected the impact of higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $4.9 billion at June 30th, compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. The increase reflects our May issuance of $600 million of 31-year unsecured senior notes, with a coupon of 3.45%, the proceeds of which will be used to retire $350 million of notes that mature next July with the remainder being available for general corporate purposes. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of June up 9%, compared to $12.8 billion at the end of the year. During the first half of 2021 we repurchased 51,000 common shares of our stock, under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, a great set of numbers in each of our engines through the first six months. However, our attention has already turned to the back half of the year, as we focus on executing against our business plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks Jeremy and good morning everyone. At the halfway point of this year, we put ourselves in a position to achieve or possibly exceed the goals we set for 2021. We've realized significant premium growth across both our Insurance and Reinsurance operations. At the same time, we've achieved double-digit rate increases in Insurance and Reinsurance. Most importantly, we see continued runway to capture strong growth and price increases, throughout the remainder of the year. Excuse me. After being slightly behind our targets in the first quarter, due to an unusually high cat activity, we had an excellent second quarter to bring our combined ratio for the six months to 90%, right in line with our 2021 target. We continue to find growth opportunities across all of our insurance platforms, potential new investment offerings at Nephila, expanded program offerings at State National and the completion of the long-awaited initial capital raise at Lodgepine. While we realize there's a long way to go in 2021 and that the pandemic continues to throw all of us curve balls, we like where we stand today and are extremely optimistic about the rest of this year and beyond. Now I'll discuss our Insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So kicking off with the Insurance segment, gross written premiums in the insurance segment for both the quarter and year-to-date periods were up 17% over prior periods with just under $3.5 billion in total premium writings for the six months. Earned premiums were up 16% in the quarter and 14% for the six months, due to continued premium growth across multiple quarters. Premium growth in both periods was driven by continued strong new business growth along with the impact from rate increases across several product lines, most notably in our professional liability and general liability product lines. The vast majority of our growth continues to be in our preferred product offerings. As discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see favorable rate environments within most of our product lines, with the exception of workers' compensation. And look to continue to capitalize on the current market conditions. The combined ratio for the Insurance segment for the second quarter was an 84% versus 88% last year. The four-point decrease in the combined ratio for the quarter was primarily due to lower attritional loss ratios within the general liability property and professional liability lines, again due in part to benefits from achieving higher premium rates. The combined ratio for the first six months of the year in the Insurance segment was 87% compared to 103% last year. The current year combined ratio includes $43 million or two points of underwriting losses from Winter Storm Uri while prior year combined ratio includes $293 million or 13 points of underwriting losses from COVID-19, which were recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from losses from catastrophes and COVID-19 the combined ratio decreased by four points, year-over-year primary driven -- primarily driven by a lower attritional loss ratio in our professional liability, general liability and property product lines. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and year-to-date within our Insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior year's loss ratio. Next turning to our Reinsurance segment, there's a lot to unpack in our results. And I think they're best understood if we try to focus on year-to-date results. Let me begin with a reminder that starting in the first quarter of this year we transitioned our Reinsurance property line -- our Reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations. We will continue to see the impacts from the Reinsurance property transition throughout the remainder of this year. Gross written premiums were up 10% and earned premiums were up 11% on a year-to-date basis. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines. Premium growth in our professional and general liability lines was driven by premium growth in underlying portfolios being reinsured double-digit rate increases and new business opportunities. There's no accident that the places we're growing in both Insurance and Reinsurance are casualty and professional liability lines. These are areas that we have historically been very strong at Markel. The combined ratio for the first six months within the Reinsurance segment was 105% versus 102% last year, driven by a higher prior accident year's loss ratio partially offset by a lower current year -- current accident year loss ratio and expense ratio. Through the first six months of 2021 we experienced $50 million of adverse prior year's loss reserve development compared to $2 million a year ago. Almost 2/3 of this prior accident years development relates to COVID-19 losses on property business interruption exposures. Again that was recorded in the first quarter of 2021. And we also had the reallocation of COVID-19 reinsurance recoveries between Insurance and Reinsurance segment in the second quarter of 2021. There was no change in our overall COVID estimates. That was just a reallocation of reinsurance recoveries. And finally unfavorable movement on prior year's catastrophe events. The lower current accident year loss ratio this year was due to a 2-point reduction from natural cat events with $25 million or 5 points from the losses on Winter Storm Uri this year and $32 million or 7 points of losses from COVID-19 last year and a 2-point reduction in the attritional loss ratio due to the reduction in the loss ratio in our property lines. The lower expense ratio year-to-date was due to lower compensation in general expenses due to the transfer of our reinsurance property line and the impact of higher earned premiums. If you exclude prior accident year loss development and natural catastrophe losses our attritional combined ratio is benefiting from the runoff of our property portfolio and the year-to-date performance of our retro reinsurance portfolio.  For our ongoing core specialty casualty and professionally reinsurance lines we are achieving pricing on the 21 underwriting in the year that we believe will ultimately meet our underwriting return objectives of 90% combined or better. However this is going to require several quarters to materialize in our reported results as we continue to recognize earnings from less profitable contracts written in more recent years and we execute our philosophy of establishing reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. We are working hard to position this book for profitability moving forward. Next I'll touch on Program Services and ILS operations both of which are reported as part of other operations. At State National we continue to see strong gross written premium volume from those operations with premium volume of $761 million and $1.4 billion for the current quarter and year-to-date periods resulting in a year-to-date production growth of 40%. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and additional new programs. Premium in the first quarter of 2020 was also impacted by the onetime unfavorable adjustment of $55 million related to the in-force cancellation of a program. As a reminder almost all of the gross written premium within our Program Services operations is ceded. We continue to see a strong pipeline for Program Services opportunities with the current market conditions. Moving to our ILS operations. Our ILS operations consisted the results of Nephila plus start-up and operating expenses related to Lodgepine. For the quarter operating revenues within our ILS operations increased due to growth in our Nephila MGA operations. For the year revenues from the ILS operations are down due in part to lower average assets under management at Nephila in the first six months of 2021 versus the first six months of 2020, partially offset by growth from our MGA operations. Assets under management in Nephila were $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2021. We continue to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and have several opportunities in the works for the second half of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. Finally, we'd like to make a comment regarding Lodgepine. We are very excited that we were able to raise approximately $100 million of investor capital at Lodgepine as of July 1 this year, of which Markel contributed $19 million as an investor. Starting in the third quarter of this year, a portion of the results from our retro reinsurance book will transition from our underwriting results within the Reinsurance segment to the management fees as part of our ILS operations, with our expectation that over time all results from our retro reinsurance product will move into ILS operations with Markel retaining a participation as an investor. Finally, I'll finish up with a few market comments, but also obviously happy to talk about that when we get into questions. As we enter the third quarter, we see continuing pricing momentum in almost all lines. Our insurance rate increases continue to average in the low-double-digits. Reinsurance rates, which as we've previously discussed, have lagged primary insurance pricing are also now averaging in the low-double-digits. We believe that pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, recently elevated cat activity, social and CPI inflation, COVID-19 losses and economic uncertainty, are likely to persist throughout the rest of this year and into 2022. We continue to see benefits to our business as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Obviously, we're all paying close attention to developments with the delta variant. Small businesses and construction business, which are meaningful parts of our portfolio, are showing signs of recovery and it is showing up in our premium writings. To sum it all up, we're in a great position as we move into the second half of the year and we are very excited for the opportunities we continue to see. Thanks for your time today, and I'd like to turn it over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. Well, Jeremy gave you the numbers, and I won't belabor them. As Larry David might say, they're pretty, pretty good. And I believe them to be sustainable over the long-term. Now, here are the main takeaways from my point of view. First, our balance sheet is in great shape. We extended our debt maturities by issuing $600 million at a rate of 3.45% with a 31-year maturity in May. Our cash and short-term liquidity stands at roughly $7.5 billion and our equity investment portfolio stands at over $8 billion against the cost to that of $2.8 billion. Those numbers suggest that we've got a very conservative balance sheet and plenty of liquidity to deploy as we find opportunities to do so. Investment markets and opportunities to acquire additional Markel Ventures businesses remains somewhat limited, due to what I would describe, as pretty high levels of overall pricing. Despite that reality, we've been able to use our financial strength and deploy capital, following the four-part triage that we've laid out in the annual report over many years. First, we continue to fund internal growth opportunities in our Insurance and Ventures businesses. The solid growth in our insurance premiums requires capital to write business and we've got it. As written premiums produce underwriting profits over time, those underwriting profits become available to allocate across the 360-degree range of capital allocation opportunities we enjoy at Markel. Our Markel Ventures operations are also growing and producing excellent results. Overall, the Ventures businesses are quite capital efficient. Absent acquisitions, they tend to grow and produce capital at the same time. As Martha Stewart would say, that's a good thing. Second, while we did not make any acquisitions during the first half of 2021, we continue to participate in many discussions and we see unique opportunities that come from our existing network of businesses we're already in and the people who are already on our team. Our reputation as dependable partners and is a great home for long-term oriented people and businesses continues to grow. We're continuing to see unique opportunities to deploy capital productively and grow Markel as a direct result. I think this is a growing competitive advantage for us. The value of being long-term, dependable and trustworthy partners continues to compound over time. I believe this is our X factor. It's our magic formula that will produce future opportunities to deploy capital productively over time. Third, we continue to make modest purchases of publicly traded equity securities. Despite the record level of the overall market, we continue to find well-priced and attractive equity investment opportunities. We continue to invest systematically and regularly in public equities. We've got room to do more as opportunities and circumstances present themselves over time they have and I believe they will. Fourth, we continue to methodically repurchase shares of Markel, as we have the ability to fund the first three categories still have money left over and find Markel stock attractively priced. To close, thank you again for your support and your shared dedication to making Markel one of the world's great companies. We're delighted to report the progress against that goal in the first half of 2021, and we look forward to continuing to work our way at it in the years to come. With that, we'd be delighted to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeff Schmitt: Hi, good morning. Just looking at growth levels and rate levels in the insurance segment, professional liability, general liability, you've been compounding rates for several years now. I presume your rate adequacy have been for some time. But are you seeing any signs of increasing competition there or do you think the market is still kind of rate efficient? I mean it seems like a good opportunity to continue expanding your margins there.\nRichie Whitt: Hey, Jeff, yes, rates have been very good in professional and casualty. And I do think we \u2013 I think we've been at rate adequacy for quite a while. I do think there is concern in the industry around just what may happen with claims inflation, social inflation and things of that sort. And so I think that has kept pressure on rates. I think also just the fact that it takes a lower combined ratio today to generate acceptable returns, given the interest rate environment. So I think there's a lot of factors at play. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, professional liability and casualty, where Markel is really made its name over the decades. I mean that's where we have always performed extremely well and we like that business and we like to grow when the opportunity is there. So Rates continue to be solid. I think as other people have said, I think they've plateaued but we don't see them falling off, which is nice to see. So those are the areas that we are most comfortable and have seemed to be most profitable for Markel over the years and we're going to continue to push forward hard in both those areas both on the Insurance and Reinsurance side.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. The \u2013 and then in Markel Ventures, just thinking about the Lansing Building Products company, just with building costs going up so much from inflation, is that a business I mean can you pass those costs through completely? Are you seeing sort of margin contraction from inflation? Can you maybe speak on that? \nTom Gayner: Yes. This is Tom. So far we have been able to pass through the price increases that we've seen there, as really throughout all of Markel Ventures inflation. It's interesting to sort of see the press reporting in the academic or governmental commentary. I can tell you as a person responsible for running real businesses, there's inflation everywhere and everything in every dimension. So we're getting that from our vendors but our customers are getting that from us too. It's the reality of business. Everything is costing more. We're passing those costs through, and there's simply no alternative to not doing that. \nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And that's not just in Lansing you're talking about across Markel Ventures, you're sort of able to pass all those costs through.\nTom Gayner: Yes.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to talk about the ventures business, I always get the feel that the potential acquisitions are a bit frothy at least in their valuations. But I was wondering, does the potential change to personal tax rate in any way create an acceleration of potential acquisitions here? I feel like this conversation or at least this idea is usually applied to the independent agent or broker market. But I wasn't sure if there was any way to comply to the venture operations as well just given the makeup of most of the acquisitions you've had recently?\nTom Gayner: Right. Well, in general in terms of acquisition prices and multiples that people are paying out there, they are higher. And I've been saying this for the last, I don't know four or five years. So we've not really been aggressively trying to buy things or go out and make a lot of outgoing calls. But fortunately, the reputation that's spreading out there based on what we've done and people who are already part of the family, friends they know and networks and contacts and whatnot we get some really fascinating inbound calls with people looking to join up if possible. And that's really where the deal flow is coming from, and I think that continues. That does not describe the general market, that describes people who are looking for the very specific set of values and long-term thinking of the way Markel does thing. So that's part of the X factor. In terms of the frequency and intensity of those phone calls, right now and potential changes in tax rates driving that. My sense is yes, very much people are thinking that. Yes, I was thinking about maybe selling someday, maybe that day is now. So yes, we're getting a lot of calls. \nPhil Stefano: Okay. And is there a way for you to help us think about growth moving forward in the ventures business? So it feels like we lap the Lansing acquisition and things should be \"normal\" whatever that means these days. But how do we think about growth versus economic rebound and how these two might move in coordination?\nTom Gayner: Right. Again I would just encourage you to take as long, but term view as you possibly can and recognize that since 2005 when Markel Ventures started at zero, now it's a $3 billion top line and on track for $400 million of EBITDA. If you just took the first half and multiply it by two that's not a forecast, but it's just the math of kind of where things stand. So without a specific growth target or a specific growth plan, we're always trying to be better. And if you can execute about being better, the world tends to give you more to do.\nPhil Stefano: I appreciate the long-term view unfortunately my models on a quarterly basis. So I take someone in the server as well. Moving over to Richie on the\u2026\nTom Gayner: On your model, I would just suggest you multiply something by more than 1.0.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Got it. Thank you. And on the underwriting side Richie, I was hoping you could talk about the mechanics of rate versus trend and the extent to which we're realizing the gap there as we earn through. Look, I mean, you've historically had a conservative reserving philosophy. And so to me you might not be realizing the entirety of rate versus trend, but -- maybe you could just help frame for us the attritional benefit that we're seeing a rate versus trend or is it business mix? What's driving the improvement here?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. I mean, we are -- it is clear, we are starting to recognize some of that margin between the rates we're achieving and where we believe trend is. We have to be careful about that, because we -- within reason we can calculate the rate increases, but trend it's an estimate. At best, we're estimating what we think trend is. But I mean, I think we've already got enough data, enough information at this point that we have started to recognize some of that margin. And I think we'll continue to recognize more of that margin as we forward. We felt like we were comfortably ahead of trends when rate increases sort of picked up started and they started I would say in most lines probably three years ago. They were nothing spectacular initially. But over the last two years or last 18 months, certainly that picked up substantially. So some of it is baked in there. I couldn't tell you if it's 20% or 30% or 50% or 80%. I don't really know. That's going to play out as the actuaries give a much better sense of how trend is moving given what we're all seeing in terms of CPI inflation and then of course social inflation.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Heleniak with RBC.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Good morning. I wonder if you can talk about the reinsurance unit which had significant premium growth that was much higher than it had been running in the past few quarters. And I appreciate that can be lumpy. You mentioned a few areas, but just wondering if we should expect to continue to see that in the second half of the year given it sounds like you're your commentary was a little more upbeat in terms of the rates you're seeing out there, but any thoughts on that?\nRichie Whitt: Well, the reinsurance growth, I mean, your first comment it's lumpy. It's absolutely correct. It is lumpy. Individual contracts can -- especially it's a fairly low premium base compared to our insurance operations. So large contracts on a small premium base can lead to large percentage changes and we saw that this quarter. The reality is. The reinsurance business is heavily weighted to the first half of the year. And so I would expect unless a deal comes up here or there, we're probably going to trend at lower growth rates for the rest of the year. One, because just the amount of business that's out there in the second half of the year and we're not really looking to grow other than the contracts we've already added this year. So second half of the year, I mean, I can't promise anything. A great piece of business could come across the transom tomorrow and we might want to write it. But I don't really expect much in the way of growth for the rest of the year.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's definitely helpful. And then, the -- you mentioned, I guess it was the beginning of the year the efforts to discontinue the property reinsurance. Is there any update on, I appreciate that also takes sort of -- that can take a while to play out, but how much of an impact was it in the first half of the year as you started doing that?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. It's going as we expected. We stopped writing premium in the Reinsurance unit on January 1. So starting with January one renewals, we've stopped renewing in the Reinsurance operations. And those were looked at by Nephila. And the ones they wanted to renew they did the ones didn't they didn't. So we've been in runoff on the underwriting side for the last six months. Probably the best way to explain it to you is just in terms of limits exposed that's down by over 50% at this point. So it was a fairly quick because of the size of the January 1 renewals then the April 1 renewals and the June 1 renewals which are Florida, not having renewed those through the first half of the year, limits exposed on property as we enter wind season now are down by over 50%. And we would expect by sometime next year that that would be pretty close to zero by the end of next year. So moving along at pace.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's definitely good detail. And then wondering if you could talk about the -- you mentioned to fill some new opportunities in the back half of the year. I wonder if you could flesh that a little more. And then the Lodgepine, congratulations on the launch. And just wondering where you kind of feel like you can build that maybe any more detail on that -- opportunities for that over time? And how many investors you retracted. Just any color there as well?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. I have to be a little careful because for SEC reasons you can't be viewed as marketing in terms of the things you're doing. But I can say -- what we've seen is a lot of interest from investors in bespoke funds. We have multi-investor funds and those have done very well over the years, but we're seeing more and more interest from investors to establish kind of their own trading strategy. They may be interested in a certain return profile versus a certain risk profile. They may be interested in ESG opportunities. So we're definitely seeing more interest from investors in bespoke trading strategies and we're working with them to try to try to put those together and we're hopeful that as we get towards the end of the year and as we get into 2022 we'll have been able to set up a few of those. In terms of Lodgepine, the capital raise that moves about 40% of the current retro book into the Lodgepine fund. We have committed to keeping about 20% of the exposure or Markel either on our balance sheet or as an investor. So we've got a ways we could go with the current portfolio. In terms of our ability to grow the retro portfolio, it really depends on market conditions. Market conditions are good right now. And if they continue to be good, we certainly could grow the retro portfolio, we're writing and add new investors, but we're committed to -- we want that to be an underwriting -- had done in an underwriting profit. And so it will depend on market conditions as we go through the renewals and get towards January 1 is really the big renewal date on retro business and we'll see where the market stands as we approach that. \nScott Heleniak: Okay. Fair enough. And then just the last one. I know we're touching on a little bit earlier on inflation just general inflation and social inflation. Wondering -- if I heard you right, I think you were saying rate increases are outpacing loss cost trends. We're seeing core loss ratio improvement. And so just to confirm you expect that to continue kind of into the second half of the year into 2022 then the continued improvement? \nRichie Whitt: Yes, I think, so. I mean I think I've mentioned admittedly it was pretty modest in the beginning, but we've been seeing rate increases and we've been compounding rate increases for almost three years now. I think we all believe -- I mean you can see as Tom said you can see it everywhere. Inflation is out there. I think that will impact loss cost trends. But we are comfortable because of where our starting point was that we are ahead of loss cost trends. But we have to be careful. We don't know exactly what loss cost trends are and so we don't want to recognize too much of that more likely redundant than deficient, is their philosophy here. And so we're going to be careful as we bring that margin that we're seeing into our results.\nScott Heleniak: All right. Okay. That makes sense. Appreciate the answers. Thanks.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. \nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I was hoping you could talk about capital usage and management. So you guys are one-third and then the Ventures that is obviously creating capital underwriting is consuming and investing, I guess, maybe you can tell us is it creating, we're consuming at this point? And underlying that is, how should we, think about repurchases, maybe you could give us just a refresher on the repurchase philosophy for the company as we think about capital looking ahead, over the year run of course.\nTom Gayner: Yeah. And we talked about the four-part triage, we've written about in the annual report for a number of years and I referred to it earlier. So the first thing is you fund the organic opportunities that you have. The people that are already on your team that are proven winners when they have opportunities to grow and deploy capital, we want to support those people first and foremost top of the list. Second thing, the acquisitions, and we can do and have over the years done insurance acquisitions. We've done the Ventures acquisitions. So as we see opportunities there we want to have capital to seize opportunities when they present themselves. The third thing is our publicly traded investment portfolio. And we're modestly not massively modestly investing in public equities right now. And then, fourth is after we funded the first three buckets. If Markel stock appears undervalued, and we have excess capital then the appropriate thing for us to do is to start buying in stock. We've repurchased very modestly over the years, because we've always had a pretty robust set of opportunities in the first three buckets. We suspended repurchases in the middle of this time last year, when we were operating under very different sort of conditions, but we started that in the first quarter of this year and that continued through the second quarter.

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you. Welcome to the Markel Corporation Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm joined this morning by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO Jeremy Noble. Our goal as always is to provide you with some insights on how things are going here at Markel and to answer any questions you have about your business. I'm especially pleased to offer today's report. I've now been at Markel for 30.5 years. That means its quarter number 122. Frankly, some quarters are better than others and this is one of those quarters that's better. As such, it's fun to be able to share this report with you. The headline is that all three engines of Markel performed well and provided great thrust in the first half of 2021. The even better news is that none of the engines red lined to get there. People are working hard and the financial outcomes reflect their excellent, as well as hard work. But these are the sorts of results that Markel can and should produce over long periods of time. We've got an insurance business, producing solid underwriting profits and growing at the same time. We've got a collection of unique and wonderful businesses in our Markel Ventures operations that produced excellent financial results and they're growing. And we've got an investment operation that protects the financial underpinning of Markel and earned strong financial results at the same time. These outcomes, flow directly from the underlying values, held by the people of Markel. As an organization, we are dedicated to serving our customers, our fellow associates and our shareholders, who provide us with the capital to operate this business. Our structure as we continue to work to build one of the world's great companies is truly win, win, win, and we're delighted to share the first half report card with you and the good marks in all the subjects. We know that winning over time is a long-term gain. One quarter, 1/2 of the year, do not begin to describe or justify what we are trying to do. But in order to win a national championship, you do have to win some individual games along the way. This quarter and the first half are just a few games. We know that we have and will continue to lose a few games along the way, but the long-term results should not get us relegated. More importantly, we're excited about our prospects and the actions we've taken as managers to improve the likelihood that will continue to produce excellent results over time. Thank you for your ongoing support and confidence as we've done so. We appreciate that more than you can imagine, and we look forward to your thoughtful questions. At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeremy, who will review the financial results from the first half. Richie will then discuss our insurance operations and then I'll come back with a few comments on our ventures and investment engines. Following that, we will open the floor for questions. Jeremy? Thank you, Richie. Well, Jeremy gave you the numbers, and I won't belabor them. As Larry David might say, they're pretty, pretty good. And I believe them to be sustainable over the long-term. Now, here are the main takeaways from my point of view. First, our balance sheet is in great shape. We extended our debt maturities by issuing $600 million at a rate of 3.45% with a 31-year maturity in May. Our cash and short-term liquidity stands at roughly $7.5 billion and our equity investment portfolio stands at over $8 billion against the cost to that of $2.8 billion. Those numbers suggest that we've got a very conservative balance sheet and plenty of liquidity to deploy as we find opportunities to do so. Investment markets and opportunities to acquire additional Markel Ventures businesses remains somewhat limited, due to what I would describe, as pretty high levels of overall pricing. Despite that reality, we've been able to use our financial strength and deploy capital, following the four-part triage that we've laid out in the annual report over many years. First, we continue to fund internal growth opportunities in our Insurance and Ventures businesses. The solid growth in our insurance premiums requires capital to write business and we've got it. As written premiums produce underwriting profits over time, those underwriting profits become available to allocate across the 360-degree range of capital allocation opportunities we enjoy at Markel. Our Markel Ventures operations are also growing and producing excellent results. Overall, the Ventures businesses are quite capital efficient. Absent acquisitions, they tend to grow and produce capital at the same time. As Martha Stewart would say, that's a good thing. Second, while we did not make any acquisitions during the first half of 2021, we continue to participate in many discussions and we see unique opportunities that come from our existing network of businesses we're already in and the people who are already on our team. Our reputation as dependable partners and is a great home for long-term oriented people and businesses continues to grow. We're continuing to see unique opportunities to deploy capital productively and grow Markel as a direct result. I think this is a growing competitive advantage for us. The value of being long-term, dependable and trustworthy partners continues to compound over time. I believe this is our X factor. It's our magic formula that will produce future opportunities to deploy capital productively over time. Third, we continue to make modest purchases of publicly traded equity securities. Despite the record level of the overall market, we continue to find well-priced and attractive equity investment opportunities. We continue to invest systematically and regularly in public equities. We've got room to do more as opportunities and circumstances present themselves over time they have and I believe they will. Fourth, we continue to methodically repurchase shares of Markel, as we have the ability to fund the first three categories still have money left over and find Markel stock attractively priced. To close, thank you again for your support and your shared dedication to making Markel one of the world's great companies. We're delighted to report the progress against that goal in the first half of 2021, and we look forward to continuing to work our way at it in the years to come. With that, we'd be delighted to answer your questions. Yes. This is Tom. So far we have been able to pass through the price increases that we've seen there, as really throughout all of Markel Ventures inflation. It's interesting to sort of see the press reporting in the academic or governmental commentary. I can tell you as a person responsible for running real businesses, there's inflation everywhere and everything in every dimension. So we're getting that from our vendors but our customers are getting that from us too. It's the reality of business. Everything is costing more. We're passing those costs through, and there's simply no alternative to not doing that. Yes. Right. Well, in general in terms of acquisition prices and multiples that people are paying out there, they are higher. And I've been saying this for the last, I don't know four or five years. So we've not really been aggressively trying to buy things or go out and make a lot of outgoing calls. But fortunately, the reputation that's spreading out there based on what we've done and people who are already part of the family, friends they know and networks and contacts and whatnot we get some really fascinating inbound calls with people looking to join up if possible. And that's really where the deal flow is coming from, and I think that continues. That does not describe the general market, that describes people who are looking for the very specific set of values and long-term thinking of the way Markel does thing. So that's part of the X factor. In terms of the frequency and intensity of those phone calls, right now and potential changes in tax rates driving that. My sense is yes, very much people are thinking that. Yes, I was thinking about maybe selling someday, maybe that day is now. So yes, we're getting a lot of calls. Right. Again I would just encourage you to take as long, but term view as you possibly can and recognize that since 2005 when Markel Ventures started at zero, now it's a $3 billion top line and on track for $400 million of EBITDA. If you just took the first half and multiply it by two that's not a forecast, but it's just the math of kind of where things stand. So without a specific growth target or a specific growth plan, we're always trying to be better. And if you can execute about being better, the world tends to give you more to do. On your model, I would just suggest you multiply something by more than 1.0. Yeah. And we talked about the four-part triage, we've written about in the annual report for a number of years and I referred to it earlier. So the first thing is you fund the organic opportunities that you have. The people that are already on your team that are proven winners when they have opportunities to grow and deploy capital, we want to support those people first and foremost top of the list. Second thing, the acquisitions, and we can do and have over the years done insurance acquisitions. We've done the Ventures acquisitions. So as we see opportunities there we want to have capital to seize opportunities when they present themselves. The third thing is our publicly traded investment portfolio. And we're modestly not massively modestly investing in public equities right now. And then, fourth is after we funded the first three buckets. If Markel stock appears undervalued, and we have excess capital then the appropriate thing for us to do is to start buying in stock. We've repurchased very modestly over the years, because we've always had a pretty robust set of opportunities in the first three buckets. We suspended repurchases in the middle of this time last year, when we were operating under very different sort of conditions, but we started that in the first quarter of this year and that continued through the second quarter. And I think the thing you should expect from us is a steady and consistent and disciplined behavior that we hope to be able to continue quarter-after-quarter or year-after-year, so, nothing dramatic but just steady at it which should be additive. Thank you very much. We appreciate you joining us. And we look forward to catching up in 90 days or so. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks Jeremy and good morning everyone. At the halfway point of this year, we put ourselves in a position to achieve or possibly exceed the goals we set for 2021. We've realized significant premium growth across both our Insurance and Reinsurance operations. At the same time, we've achieved double-digit rate increases in Insurance and Reinsurance. Most importantly, we see continued runway to capture strong growth and price increases, throughout the remainder of the year. Excuse me. After being slightly behind our targets in the first quarter, due to an unusually high cat activity, we had an excellent second quarter to bring our combined ratio for the six months to 90%, right in line with our 2021 target. We continue to find growth opportunities across all of our insurance platforms, potential new investment offerings at Nephila, expanded program offerings at State National and the completion of the long-awaited initial capital raise at Lodgepine. While we realize there's a long way to go in 2021 and that the pandemic continues to throw all of us curve balls, we like where we stand today and are extremely optimistic about the rest of this year and beyond. Now I'll discuss our Insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and insurance-linked securities operations. So kicking off with the Insurance segment, gross written premiums in the insurance segment for both the quarter and year-to-date periods were up 17% over prior periods with just under $3.5 billion in total premium writings for the six months. Earned premiums were up 16% in the quarter and 14% for the six months, due to continued premium growth across multiple quarters. Premium growth in both periods was driven by continued strong new business growth along with the impact from rate increases across several product lines, most notably in our professional liability and general liability product lines. The vast majority of our growth continues to be in our preferred product offerings. As discussed in prior quarters, we continue to see favorable rate environments within most of our product lines, with the exception of workers' compensation. And look to continue to capitalize on the current market conditions. The combined ratio for the Insurance segment for the second quarter was an 84% versus 88% last year. The four-point decrease in the combined ratio for the quarter was primarily due to lower attritional loss ratios within the general liability property and professional liability lines, again due in part to benefits from achieving higher premium rates. The combined ratio for the first six months of the year in the Insurance segment was 87% compared to 103% last year. The current year combined ratio includes $43 million or two points of underwriting losses from Winter Storm Uri while prior year combined ratio includes $293 million or 13 points of underwriting losses from COVID-19, which were recorded in the first quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact from losses from catastrophes and COVID-19 the combined ratio decreased by four points, year-over-year primary driven -- primarily driven by a lower attritional loss ratio in our professional liability, general liability and property product lines. Higher earned premiums for both the quarter and year-to-date within our Insurance segment had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior year's loss ratio. Next turning to our Reinsurance segment, there's a lot to unpack in our results. And I think they're best understood if we try to focus on year-to-date results. Let me begin with a reminder that starting in the first quarter of this year we transitioned our Reinsurance property line -- our Reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations. We will continue to see the impacts from the Reinsurance property transition throughout the remainder of this year. Gross written premiums were up 10% and earned premiums were up 11% on a year-to-date basis. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines partially offset by lower premiums in our property lines. Premium growth in our professional and general liability lines was driven by premium growth in underlying portfolios being reinsured double-digit rate increases and new business opportunities. There's no accident that the places we're growing in both Insurance and Reinsurance are casualty and professional liability lines. These are areas that we have historically been very strong at Markel. The combined ratio for the first six months within the Reinsurance segment was 105% versus 102% last year, driven by a higher prior accident year's loss ratio partially offset by a lower current year -- current accident year loss ratio and expense ratio. Through the first six months of 2021 we experienced $50 million of adverse prior year's loss reserve development compared to $2 million a year ago. Almost 2/3 of this prior accident years development relates to COVID-19 losses on property business interruption exposures. Again that was recorded in the first quarter of 2021. And we also had the reallocation of COVID-19 reinsurance recoveries between Insurance and Reinsurance segment in the second quarter of 2021. There was no change in our overall COVID estimates. That was just a reallocation of reinsurance recoveries. And finally unfavorable movement on prior year's catastrophe events. The lower current accident year loss ratio this year was due to a 2-point reduction from natural cat events with $25 million or 5 points from the losses on Winter Storm Uri this year and $32 million or 7 points of losses from COVID-19 last year and a 2-point reduction in the attritional loss ratio due to the reduction in the loss ratio in our property lines. The lower expense ratio year-to-date was due to lower compensation in general expenses due to the transfer of our reinsurance property line and the impact of higher earned premiums. If you exclude prior accident year loss development and natural catastrophe losses our attritional combined ratio is benefiting from the runoff of our property portfolio and the year-to-date performance of our retro reinsurance portfolio.  For our ongoing core specialty casualty and professionally reinsurance lines we are achieving pricing on the 21 underwriting in the year that we believe will ultimately meet our underwriting return objectives of 90% combined or better. However this is going to require several quarters to materialize in our reported results as we continue to recognize earnings from less profitable contracts written in more recent years and we execute our philosophy of establishing reserves that are more likely redundant than deficient. We are working hard to position this book for profitability moving forward. Next I'll touch on Program Services and ILS operations both of which are reported as part of other operations. At State National we continue to see strong gross written premium volume from those operations with premium volume of $761 million and $1.4 billion for the current quarter and year-to-date periods resulting in a year-to-date production growth of 40%. Premium growth was due to both the expansion of existing programs and additional new programs. Premium in the first quarter of 2020 was also impacted by the onetime unfavorable adjustment of $55 million related to the in-force cancellation of a program. As a reminder almost all of the gross written premium within our Program Services operations is ceded. We continue to see a strong pipeline for Program Services opportunities with the current market conditions. Moving to our ILS operations. Our ILS operations consisted the results of Nephila plus start-up and operating expenses related to Lodgepine. For the quarter operating revenues within our ILS operations increased due to growth in our Nephila MGA operations. For the year revenues from the ILS operations are down due in part to lower average assets under management at Nephila in the first six months of 2021 versus the first six months of 2020, partially offset by growth from our MGA operations. Assets under management in Nephila were $9.8 billion as of June 30, 2021. We continue to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and have several opportunities in the works for the second half of 2021 and into the first half of 2022. Finally, we'd like to make a comment regarding Lodgepine. We are very excited that we were able to raise approximately $100 million of investor capital at Lodgepine as of July 1 this year, of which Markel contributed $19 million as an investor. Starting in the third quarter of this year, a portion of the results from our retro reinsurance book will transition from our underwriting results within the Reinsurance segment to the management fees as part of our ILS operations, with our expectation that over time all results from our retro reinsurance product will move into ILS operations with Markel retaining a participation as an investor. Finally, I'll finish up with a few market comments, but also obviously happy to talk about that when we get into questions. As we enter the third quarter, we see continuing pricing momentum in almost all lines. Our insurance rate increases continue to average in the low-double-digits. Reinsurance rates, which as we've previously discussed, have lagged primary insurance pricing are also now averaging in the low-double-digits. We believe that pricing momentum will continue as a multitude of factors, such as low interest rates, recently elevated cat activity, social and CPI inflation, COVID-19 losses and economic uncertainty, are likely to persist throughout the rest of this year and into 2022. We continue to see benefits to our business as the economy recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Obviously, we're all paying close attention to developments with the delta variant. Small businesses and construction business, which are meaningful parts of our portfolio, are showing signs of recovery and it is showing up in our premium writings. To sum it all up, we're in a great position as we move into the second half of the year and we are very excited for the opportunities we continue to see. Thanks for your time today, and I'd like to turn it over to Tom. Hey, Jeff, yes, rates have been very good in professional and casualty. And I do think we \u2013 I think we've been at rate adequacy for quite a while. I do think there is concern in the industry around just what may happen with claims inflation, social inflation and things of that sort. And so I think that has kept pressure on rates. I think also just the fact that it takes a lower combined ratio today to generate acceptable returns, given the interest rate environment. So I think there's a lot of factors at play. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, professional liability and casualty, where Markel is really made its name over the decades. I mean that's where we have always performed extremely well and we like that business and we like to grow when the opportunity is there. So Rates continue to be solid. I think as other people have said, I think they've plateaued but we don't see them falling off, which is nice to see. So those are the areas that we are most comfortable and have seemed to be most profitable for Markel over the years and we're going to continue to push forward hard in both those areas both on the Insurance and Reinsurance side. Yes. I mean, we are -- it is clear, we are starting to recognize some of that margin between the rates we're achieving and where we believe trend is. We have to be careful about that, because we -- within reason we can calculate the rate increases, but trend it's an estimate. At best, we're estimating what we think trend is. But I mean, I think we've already got enough data, enough information at this point that we have started to recognize some of that margin. And I think we'll continue to recognize more of that margin as we forward. We felt like we were comfortably ahead of trends when rate increases sort of picked up started and they started I would say in most lines probably three years ago. They were nothing spectacular initially. But over the last two years or last 18 months, certainly that picked up substantially. So some of it is baked in there. I couldn't tell you if it's 20% or 30% or 50% or 80%. I don't really know. That's going to play out as the actuaries give a much better sense of how trend is moving given what we're all seeing in terms of CPI inflation and then of course social inflation. Well, the reinsurance growth, I mean, your first comment it's lumpy. It's absolutely correct. It is lumpy. Individual contracts can -- especially it's a fairly low premium base compared to our insurance operations. So large contracts on a small premium base can lead to large percentage changes and we saw that this quarter. The reality is. The reinsurance business is heavily weighted to the first half of the year. And so I would expect unless a deal comes up here or there, we're probably going to trend at lower growth rates for the rest of the year. One, because just the amount of business that's out there in the second half of the year and we're not really looking to grow other than the contracts we've already added this year. So second half of the year, I mean, I can't promise anything. A great piece of business could come across the transom tomorrow and we might want to write it. But I don't really expect much in the way of growth for the rest of the year. Yes. It's going as we expected. We stopped writing premium in the Reinsurance unit on January 1. So starting with January one renewals, we've stopped renewing in the Reinsurance operations. And those were looked at by Nephila. And the ones they wanted to renew they did the ones didn't they didn't. So we've been in runoff on the underwriting side for the last six months. Probably the best way to explain it to you is just in terms of limits exposed that's down by over 50% at this point. So it was a fairly quick because of the size of the January 1 renewals then the April 1 renewals and the June 1 renewals which are Florida, not having renewed those through the first half of the year, limits exposed on property as we enter wind season now are down by over 50%. And we would expect by sometime next year that that would be pretty close to zero by the end of next year. So moving along at pace. Yes. I have to be a little careful because for SEC reasons you can't be viewed as marketing in terms of the things you're doing. But I can say -- what we've seen is a lot of interest from investors in bespoke funds. We have multi-investor funds and those have done very well over the years, but we're seeing more and more interest from investors to establish kind of their own trading strategy. They may be interested in a certain return profile versus a certain risk profile. They may be interested in ESG opportunities. So we're definitely seeing more interest from investors in bespoke trading strategies and we're working with them to try to try to put those together and we're hopeful that as we get towards the end of the year and as we get into 2022 we'll have been able to set up a few of those. In terms of Lodgepine, the capital raise that moves about 40% of the current retro book into the Lodgepine fund. We have committed to keeping about 20% of the exposure or Markel either on our balance sheet or as an investor. So we've got a ways we could go with the current portfolio. In terms of our ability to grow the retro portfolio, it really depends on market conditions. Market conditions are good right now. And if they continue to be good, we certainly could grow the retro portfolio, we're writing and add new investors, but we're committed to -- we want that to be an underwriting -- had done in an underwriting profit. And so it will depend on market conditions as we go through the renewals and get towards January 1 is really the big renewal date on retro business and we'll see where the market stands as we approach that. Yes, I think, so. I mean I think I've mentioned admittedly it was pretty modest in the beginning, but we've been seeing rate increases and we've been compounding rate increases for almost three years now. I think we all believe -- I mean you can see as Tom said you can see it everywhere. Inflation is out there. I think that will impact loss cost trends. But we are comfortable because of where our starting point was that we are ahead of loss cost trends. But we have to be careful. We don't know exactly what loss cost trends are and so we don't want to recognize too much of that more likely redundant than deficient, is their philosophy here. And so we're going to be careful as we bring that margin that we're seeing into our results. Thanks."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. As Tom referenced, we are halfway through the year and are very pleased with the outstanding performance across each of our three operating engines as our Insurance, Investments, and Ventures operations each contributed meaningfully to our efforts to build shareholder value. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $4.3 billion for the first half of 2021 compared to $3.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 15%. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends across most of our product lines, most prominently within our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 85% for the first half of 2021, which is up one point from the same period last year primarily driven by changes in the mix of business within our Reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 14% to $3.1 billion in the first half of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher written premium volume within our professional liability and general liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2021 was a 90% which included $68 million or two points of losses on Winter Storm Uri. This compares to a 103% combined ratio for the same period last year, which included 12 points of losses from COVID-19. Excluding the loss impacts of Winter Storm Uri and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2021 was an 88% compared to 91% for the same period of 2020. This improvement reflects a four-point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and a one and a half point improvement in our expense ratio, which were partially offset by a lower benefit from prior year loss reserve releases. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $226 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $268 million in the first half of 2020. Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included a net income of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $770 million in the first half of 2020, which reflected the impact of significant declines in the fair value of our equity portfolio in the first quarter of 2020, driven by the unfavorable market value movements, resulting from the onset of the pandemic followed by a partial recovery in the second quarter of 2020. As I mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. With regards to net investment income, we reported $193 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $184 million in the same period last year. Investment income continues to be impacted by the low interest rate environment we currently face. Net unrealized investment gains decreased by $162 million net of taxes during the first half of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from an overall increase in the interest rates since the end of the year. Now, I'll cover the results for our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased to $1.8 billion for the first half of 2021 compared to $1.2 billion for the comparable period a year ago. The increase reflects a more significant contribution of revenues from Lansing Building Products which was acquired in April of 2020. Additionally, operating revenues increased across our consumer and building products businesses, equipment manufacturing businesses, and transportation-related businesses due in part to lower sales volumes at most of these businesses in 2020 as a result of the economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic as well as further increases in demand within our consumer and building products businesses, reflecting increases in consumer spending. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $220 million for the first half of 2021 compared to $173 million for the same period last year. The year-over-year increase is attributed to increased sales volumes and a more significant contribution from Lansing. Looking at our consolidated results for the first half of the year, our effective tax rate was at 21% for both 2021 and 2020. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.3 billion in this year compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $484 million last year. And comprehensive income to shareholders for the first half of this year was $1.2 billion compared to a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $260 million in the first half a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital, and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $813 million for the first half of 2021 compared to $489 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in the first half of this year reflected the impact of higher premium volume in our Insurance segment. Invested assets at the holding company were $4.9 billion at June 30th, compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. The increase reflects our May issuance of $600 million of 31-year unsecured senior notes, with a coupon of 3.45%, the proceeds of which will be used to retire $350 million of notes that mature next July with the remainder being available for general corporate purposes. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of June up 9%, compared to $12.8 billion at the end of the year. During the first half of 2021 we repurchased 51,000 common shares of our stock, under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, a great set of numbers in each of our engines through the first six months. However, our attention has already turned to the back half of the year, as we focus on executing against our business plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses."

You may find the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation to GAAP for these measures in our most recent Form 10-Q which can be found on our Web site at www.markel.com in the Investor Relations section. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Thank you so much good morning and welcome to the Markel Corporation first quarter conference call. This is Tom Gayner and I'm joined today by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt and our CFO Jeremy Noble. The purpose of today's call is to give you a brief update on our business and answer any questions you might have about Markel. Well, what a difference a year makes, in my opinion, the first quarter of last year, ranked as the toughest 90 days in the history of the Markel Corporation. It felt more like 90 years than 90 days. This year's first quarter report is better, a lot better. A year ago, despite the very real, tangible, and intangible costs from the shock of COVID-19, we pressed on, we persisted. The people of Markel demonstrated their resilience, skills, and adaptability, and they produce significant rebounds in every aspect of our business as the year went on. Today, we're pleased to report to you another milestone of progress. Each of our three engines of insurance, investments and Markel Ventures produced positive results in the first quarter, and we're optimistic about their prospects. We know we've got more work to do. There's always more work to do. We're excited to be able to report to you results from our insurance operations that are in line with our stated goals of growth and profitability that we outlined in our 10-5-1 initiative. We're pleased with the improved profitability and risk reductions in our reinsurance business. We're earning appropriate and disciplined returns from our investments, Markel Ventures continues to earn excellent returns, which increases the durability and value of the Markel Corporation, and we're optimistic they will achieve meaningfully better results in our insurance-linked securities operations. Jeremy will review the headline numbers from the quarter, and then Richie will cover the insurance, ILS, and state/national operations. I'll come back to chat about investments in Markel Ventures. And then, we will open the floor for questions. With that, Jeremy.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. As Tom said what a difference a year makes. Our first-quarter 2021 results showcased the benefits that come from operating our diverse three-engine model with our insurance, investments, and ventures operations, each performing well and adding value in the quarter. Looking at our operating results, gross written premiums were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of 13%. This increase was largely attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $1.6 billion, an increase of 16% compared to the same period of 2020. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends, both of which are most prominent within our professional liability and general liability product lines, but also experienced within our personal lines and marine and energy product lines. Within our reinsurance segment, gross written premiums increased 4% to $533 million. Also reflecting growth in our general liability and professional liability product lines, partially offset by lower premium volume on our property product lines, given our decision to transfer this portfolio to Nephila late last year. Retention in gross written premiums was 87% in 2021, which is up two points from the same period last year, primarily driven by changes in the mix of business within our reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 13% to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2021 was 94, which included $64 million or four points of losses attributable to a winter storm Uri and $19 million or one point of adverse development arising from a change in our estimates of the COVID-19 ultimate losses. This compares to a 118 combined ratio for the same period last year, which included 24 points of losses attributed to the COVID-19. Excluding the loss impacts of winter storm Uri and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2021 was an 88 compared to a 94 in the same period of 2020. This improvement reflects a four point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and a two-point improvement in our expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior-year loss reserves developed favorably by $91 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $104 million in the first quarter 2020. Favorable development on prioryear actuary loss reserves in the first quarter of 2021 was net of the $19 million of adverse development related to COVID-19 that I just mentioned, all of which was within our reinsurance segment on our property product line arising from updated and new loss information from cedents. Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included in net income were $527 million in the first quarter 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020 attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by unfavorable market value movements resulting from the onset of the pandemic. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability, and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, we may continue to see volatility in the equity markets. With regards to net investment income, we reported $97 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $88 million in the same period last year. The increase this quarter reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments in the first quarter of last year, partially offset by lower short-term investment income due to lower short-term interest rates during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter 2020. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $214 million net of taxes during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates during the first quarter of 2021. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues for Markel Ventures increased $707 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $511 million in the comparable quarter last year. This increase reflects the contributions of revenues from our April 2020 acquisition of Lansing Building Products. Excluding the contributions of Lansing in the first quarter of 2021, operating revenues in our Markel Ventures operations decreased compared to 2020 as a result of lower sales volumes, primarily our transportation related and consulting services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $81 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $67 million during the same period last year. The year-over-year increases attributed to a gain recognized in connection with the sale of a portion of one of our healthcare businesses. EBITDA from our other Markel Ventures operations decreased due to the impact of lower operating revenues at our transportation-related and consulting services businesses this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2020. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 20% compared to 21% in the first quarter a year ago. We reported net income to common shareholders of $574 million for the first quarter of this year, compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first quarter of this year was $359 million, compared to a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.4 billion first quarter a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows capital on our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $318 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $66 million for the first quarter last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2021 reflecting the impact of higher premium volume as we continue to see strong growth in our insurance segment. Invested assets of the holding company were $4 billion at the end of March compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. Total shareholders equity stood at $13.2 billion at the end of March, up from $12.8 billion at the end of the year. During the quarter we repurchased just under 20,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, a very pleasing quarter from both a top and bottom-line within each of our three engines. Financial condition of the company remains strong and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thank you, Jeremy and good morning everyone. A strong momentum from the last half of 2020 continued in the first quarter of '21 as we achieved a combined ratio of 94%, which includes four points of cat losses from winter storm Uri and one point of losses attributable to adverse development related to COVID-19. Obviously, compared to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and results in the first quarter of 2020, we're pleased to be able to report a solid start to the year. You know there's an old golf saying that you can't win the tournament on the first day but you certainly can lose it. Despite starting the year with a slightly higher combined ratio due to the unprecedented winter storms, we believe we are still well positioned to win the tournament and achieve our previously stated underwriting profitability goals for the full year. Sure, I absolutely would have love to start the year on the right side of 90% combined but I feel like we're in striking distance. Many of the tailwinds, we've discussed in our last call remain in play with their ability to achieve meaningful rate increases across almost all insurance and reinsurance product lines, resulting in reductions in our first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratios. We continue to find areas to add new business and program opportunities and take full advantage of the current market environment, while also engaging in continuous portfolio management aimed at improving profitability and reducing overall volatility. Now I will discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations and insurance linked securities operations. So let's get started with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter in our insurance segment were up 224 million were 16% and earned premiums were up $137 million or 12% compared to 2020. Premium growth was driven by continued strong new business growth, along with the impact from rate increases across several product lines, most notably our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy and personal lines products. Virtually all of our growth continues to be in our preferred product offerings. We continue to see favorable rating environments within several of our product lines, with the exception of workers compensation and we look to continue to take advantage of these market opportunities. The combined ratio for the insurance segment for the first quarter was 91% versus 119% in the same period last year. The 28 point combined ratio decrease was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 losses in 2020 compared to much smaller cat losses in 2021. We recognize 39 million or three points of losses in the first quarter of '21 related to winter storm Uri versus $293 million or 27 points related to losses from COVID-19 last year. Besides the impact from COVID and cat losses events within our ongoing operations, we also reported a three point reduction in our 2021 current accident year attritional loss ratio. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of premium rate increases across several of the product lines I previously mentioned. In addition, we benefited from a two point reduction in our expense ratio, due to the impact of higher earned premiums, efficiency efforts and expense control. Turning to the reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter were up 19 million or 4% and earned premiums were up 28 million or 12% compared to last year. Premium growth was driven by new business due to significant new treaties in our general liability and professional liability lines, where we see attractive opportunities. As we've said in the past, individual contracts can have significant impacts on our premium writings. The growth that we saw in general liability and professional liability really related to three new contracts that we thought were good opportunities in the first quarter. This was partially offset by lower premiums in our property product line. As a reminder, during the first quarter of this year, we executed on our planned transition of our reinsurance property lines from a reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations as part of our ongoing strategy to match risk to the most appropriate capital. We will continue to see impacts from the reinsurance treaty transition throughout the remainder of the year within the results of our reinsurance segment. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment for the first quarter was up 2021 was 109% compared to 115% last year. The 2021 combined ratio was primarily driven by the impact of cap and COVID-19 losses, where we recognized 25 million or 10 points of losses related to Winter Storm Uri and 19 million or seven points of adverse prior accident year development related to COVID-19. The 2020 combined ratio included 32 million or 14 points related to losses from COVID-19. In addition, the 2021 combined ratio was favorably impacted by a decrease in our current accident year. Attritional loss ratio primarily within our property product lines and from a lower expense ratio due to the impact of higher earned premiums. While our reinsurance segment results are still not where they need to be, we achieved significant growth in our more profitable general liability and professional liability product lines this quarter and saw a favorable trends in both our current accident year attritional loss ratio and expense ratio compared to the same period a year ago. We are working hard to price all 2021 business to a 90% combined ratio or lower. The difference between the 2021 reported current accident year combined ratio and that pricing target is the result of earnings on business written in previous years and are consistent application of Markel's reserving philosophy, which is to set reserves at a level that are more likely redundant than deficient. Next I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Gross written premium volume for our state national program services operation increased by 56% to $612 million versus $393 million a year ago. Premium growth was due to the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. Premium in the first quarter of 2020 were impacted by one-time unfavorable adjustment of 55 million related to the enforced cancellation of a particular program. The overall increase in premiums under management also favorably impacted our operating revenues and margin in the quarter. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services operations is seeded. We continue to see a strong pipeline of program services opportunities in the current market. Next, I'll discuss our ILS operations. Our ILS operations consist of the results of Nephila plus startup expenses related to large five. For the quarter operating revenues within our ILS operations decreased due to lower investment management fees related to having lower assets under management versus the same period a year ago. Assets under management at Nephila were 9.5 billion as of March 31, 2021. Earnings also continued to be impacted by cost associated with building and supporting the growth of Nephila's two MGA platforms, as well as preparing for the launch of additional fund investment vehicles. Nephila continues to build and identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and launch new investment opportunities. Finally, I'd like to point out that we made a change in our disclosures this quarter to recognize the runoff nature of the CATco operations by moving those results out of the ILS operating revenues and expenses and into other for all periods presented. CATco continues to make solid progress to the quarterly wind down if its operations and currently has approximately 900 million in AUM. I'll finish up with some market commentary. Trends in the first quarter were very similar to trends we discussed on our last call. We see continued pricing momentum in almost all lines. The glaring exception I guess is workers comp, our insurance and reinsurance rate increases averaged over -- average double digits in the first quarter. Reinsurance pricing, which as we've previously discussed has lagged primary insurance pricing closed the gap some more during the first quarter and during the January 1 renewals. But it's still not as strong as rates being achieved in the primary market. This continuing dynamic obviously explains our continued double-digit growth in insurance versus roughly flat in reinsurance. As we've discussed, while new entrants and incremental capital raises certainly have impacted the market around the edges, we believe that this pricing momentum will continue due to a multitude of factors such as low interest rates, the continued elevated cat activity, social inflation, further COVID-19 impacts and economic uncertainties that are likely to persist throughout 2021. We do note that there seems to be much discussion recently of a moderation of rate increases. While it certainly does appear to us that rates are not going up at the same pace that they have over the last several quarters. We really do not view this as a cause for alarm. We're in the third year of meaningful rate increases which creates a compounding impact. It would be unrealistic to think that rates could continue to accelerate indefinitely. Also, it's worth pointing out the dynamics of all lines are not the same. While D&O price increases are beginning to stabilize cyber prices are on the way up given recent loss events and as insurance and reinsurance capacity has decreased. In our view, the overall market picture remains extremely healthy. We're also starting to see the benefit to our business as the economy recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. People probably obviously saw first quarter GDP increasing at 6.4%. Small businesses, which is a meaningful part of our portfolio is starting to show signs of recovery and it is showing up in our premium writings. To sum up the first quarter, we're off to a solid start and are excited to continue to move our business steadily forward over the rest of the year. Thanks for your time today and now, I will turn it over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. In our ventures operations, the headline numbers show revenues of 707 million compared to 511 million a year ago, an EBITDA of 81 million compared to 67 million as is usually the case though, there's more going on than what spotlighted in headlines. As to revenues, the biggest reason for the increase is the inclusion of Lansing. Typically the first quarter is seasonally the lightest for Lansing, as well as several other of our businesses. And I would expect normal seasonal increases and profitability as the year progresses. As to the increase in EBITDA, we recognize the gain from the sale of a facility within one of our healthcare operations. I would point out that transaction should give you some insight into the conservativism of the accounting in place at Markel Ventures. We've struggled a bit with our healthcare operations and the fact that we could sell a facility in an underperforming business and that would yield a gain should give you some comfort that we're not braggy when it comes to how we're reporting our results to you. For years, we've publicly stated and committed to conservativism in the presentation of our insurance results. We've operated with a goal of being more likely redundant than deficient when setting insurance reserves and I hope you take some comfort from that spirit and culture of conservativism exist at Markel Ventures as well. For the entirety of Markel Ventures, this year's first quarter was a COVID quarter to use a phrase, while our first quarter of last year was pre-COVID. We've had BC and AD as conventions to describe dates for a few millennia. For at least a little while longer, I think will distinguish the current era as PC, DC and AC. Tom Hanks was the first person I heard break up time into those categories and he is a hand veteran of the path. Personally, I'm looking forward to the AC period, but it's not here yet. I continue to be grateful and amazed for the performance throughout the Markel Ventures organization. The results are excellent. They also require more work per unit of output compared to pre-COVID circumstances. Economic activity and order books are very good. There is plenty of business to be had. And we're getting our fair share of fulfilling orders and producing goods and services is getting harder. Our ventures CEOs use new words like supply chain roulette when describing the daily realities of their business. Labor shortages and inflation are facts of life. Your team is doing an outstanding job of coping and adjusting with the realities on the ground. But what I see in real-time from real businesses seems different than many news reports and comments from officials about inflation. If current economic and financial markets conditions continue to prevail, we should enjoy record results and revenues and EBITDA this year from Markel Ventures. In the current price environment of very low interest rates and very high transaction price multiples. I do not expect us to make sizable acquisitions in 2021. We've got an excellent capital position, a lot of dry powder and a great network of CEOs and relationships that keep us connected to opportunities. But I think we're better off focusing on our existing operations and organic growth opportunities at this time. We'll adjust as circumstances change and that ability to change is a fundamentally attractive feature of our overall structure at Markel. On the investment front, we are to 8% on our equity portfolio during the first quarter. In our fixed income operations, we posted a negative 1.3% return, which occurred entirely due to rises in interest rates. There were zero credit losses in the portfolio. The total portfolio after all expenses and foreign currency adjustments, rose 1.4%. In any one quarter and frankly, in any one year, expect a lot of volatility from investments. We make no efforts to dampen volatility artificially through expensive derivatives, or the difference between publicly traded mark-to-market valuation practices versus private self reported valuation marks. We just stick to the fundamental and basic task of trying to earn the best returns we can over long periods of time. Currently, our capital position is quite strong. We've accumulated higher than normal cash positions. Fortunately, that cash supports our current growth in insurance underwriting opportunities, which carry the expectations of meaningful returns. As time goes by and capital continues to build, we expect to be able to apply capital to all four components of our capital allocation triage ladder. We're currently funding the organic growth of our insurance businesses. We've got ample capital to fund growth initiatives within our ventures operations. We're modestly adding to our publicly traded securities portfolio. We're open minded about potential acquisitions when opportunities arrive, all as they always do eventually and we are repurchasing our shares. We will continue to incur the small opportunity cost of carrying large cash balances until conditions change. We are not interested in locking in low long-term rates of return. We will continue to be opportunistic as we look at any investment decisions. To close, we're pleased with the progress we're reporting to you this morning. We've got demonstrated wonderful results in our insurance business, improving results in our reinsurance business, demonstrated wonderful results in our Markel Ventures operations, appropriate returns in our investment portfolio and gritted teeth determination to improve results in our insurance like securities operations. I love our culture and I like our hand. With that, we welcome the opportunity to answer your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeff Schmitt: Question on the rate levels, in the insurance sector -- I think in both insurance and reinsurance, you'd kind of referenced they are still at the double-digit levels, but you're kind of seeing a stabilization there. How much of that, I guess could you maybe speak to the environment, are you seeing higher competitive levels at this point or is there may be just sort of a pause in social inflation with the courts being closed? What do you see kind of driving that stabilization?\nRichie Whitt: Hey, Jeff. It's Richie. I think it's a number of factors. I pointed out, we're in the third year of rate increases. It gets harder to sell continued double-digit rate increases after you do that a couple of times. So, I mean, there is a point at which things have to level off. So, I think that is part of it. We've been in through a couple of renewal cycles and continued double-digit rate increases get harder and harder to sell. There's certainly competition always is; and certainly as you know rates, as people start to see rates go up and they have their opinion as to where those are versus rate adequacy, obviously the higher they go, the more people feel like, hey, that's a good risk and I should maybe jump in on it. So, I think it's just the signs of a healthy market. I mean, that is what's going to happen. As I said, I mean, we really did not see, I mean, we were pretty flat, quite honestly, in the first quarter, looking at rate increases versus fourth quarter. I know some people talked about being down a bit. We were sort of flattish and that growth maybe we'll see that growth dip below flat in the second quarter but still double digits in both insurance and reinsurance.\nJeff Schmitt: Okay. And then, in the reinsurance segment, just looking at that underlying loss ratio down a fair amount, high 50, I think it is 58, historically, mid 60s. And I think you'd referenced a lot of that is just a mix shift as you exit the property cat business. Is that the case? I mean, should we think of kind of high 50s being more of the run rate there versus mid 60s? I guess the same with the expense ratio, it was down at 30. I think that looks to be mix shift related, is that -- we're trying to think of the run rates in these items with that property cat business out?\nTom Gayner: Sure. Sure. Yeah, I think both of those are a little abnormal just as a result of what we're doing in terms of property and some of the other issues that happened in the quarter. I think the low 60s is probably about the right place in terms of an attritional loss ratio and maybe a tick higher on the expense ratio. We are pricing, I did say, this in my comments, the team is trying to price everything at a 90 or lower that they're putting on the books, but we're not going to see that show up in our results for a while. And two reasons, we're still earning premium that was put on books in prior years and maybe didn't have as strong rate increases. And secondly, just our conservatism, we want to be more likely redundant than deficient. We were coming off a few years of tough performance in reinsurance. We're going to be from Missouri in terms of the results for a while. So, while we're pricing it at less than 90, my goal would be something in the mid 90s in terms of what we could do this year.\nJeff Schmitt: Right. Okay. And then, just one kind of broad comment, and just looking at that compound annual growth rate of book value, I think over the last five years, the 9% stock prices increased about 5%. Do you have any general kind of thoughts or comments on that? And I mean, is there an opportunity there to maybe increase share buybacks at all to help the stock price?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, there is. And we are doing that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Hughes with Truist.\nMark Hughes: On the reinsurance business, you got the positive growth despite the trimming of your property exposure? I think you've mentioned three programs, in particular, when we think about the balance of the year, are those programs going to continue to make a contribution or are we looking at the positive top-line for reinsurance?\nRichie Whitt: The rest of the year is going to -- we will have to see how it plays out. The issue with reinsurance given are relatively small portfolio roughly $1 billion is individual deals can really move the numbers around. And so, as I said we did three deals and they ebbed up to around $90 million. I mean, so in reinsurance, individual deals can be elephant hunting. So, we found three deals that we really liked in the first quarter, I can't be certain we'll find three deals in the second quarter or any deals in the third or fourth quarter, so we're going to be very opportunistic the rest of the year, and if we think there's good deals out there that we want to write, we'll put them on the books, but if not we could be down quarter-to-quarter. So this year is all about profitability and being opportunistic. So it's going to be a little hard to give you guidance on how the next three quarters play out in terms of premium volume.\nMark Hughes: Understood. On the retention within reinsurance, it was up this quarter, I think you talked about mix. Depending on what comes in the door, is the retention likely to stay more elevated?\nRichie Whitt: Yes, it is. Our retentions on our property business were lower because of the cat protection that we bought -- reinsurance protection that we bought. We tend to keep much more of our casualty, professional, and specialty business net, so those retentions should go up.\nMark Hughes: Then in the Nephila, you talked about investments that you're making. Assets were flat to down a little bit in the quarter. When do we start to see more forward progress with Nephila at the bottom-line?\nRichie Whitt: That's a great question. I can tell you, we've been frustrated. We feel like we make two steps forward. And then there's a step backwards, Uri in the first quarter and we have losses and that obviously reduces AUM, reduces fees. It's been a tough four years in the ILS business with the cats. But we can't make excuses, we have to figure out a way to get our business moving forward. So certainly we project the business moving forward the rest of the year and certainly wanted to move forward in '22 and onward. But, we got work to do. And there's just no other way to say it, we've got work to do, to get where we want to be in ILS. And part of that is, hopefully fewer cats, but the bigger part of it is getting the right price for the exposure. So I and have a lot of other people believe prices need to continue to go up for cat risk.\nMark Hughes: If I may ask one more question. Tom, you mentioned inflation, I just wonder how you feel like the ventures businesses positioned for inflation. And what you might be doing in the equity portfolio, are you shifting on the assumption that inflation will be worse than the broader market assumes?\nTom Gayner: It would be my expectation that the actual inflation that's really taking place on the ground is more than what the headlines would report. So all of the managers who live and eat and sleep and breathe these businesses every day, they're doing the best they can to control their costs, to get their supply chains on and working and making sure that they're charging appropriately prices to earn a good margin of whatever product or service they're providing. That's true every day. That's true in the public securities portfolio of the companies we look at. And we're really looking for the same kind of behavior from the managers of our businesses at Markel Ventures, as we expect from the managers of the public traded companies that we're investing in. And that really doesn't change whether inflation is low or high. But I don't want to be caught asleep at the wheel and not aware of the heightened sensitivity and focus that I think should be applied to that line of thought these days. And to sum it up and I think I mentioned it in the comments. We think the dumbest thing you could do right now is to lock in low long-term rates of return. So we don't claim to be geniuses, or the smartest people in the room, but we try not to be the dumbest so as long as we don't do stupid things good things compound.\nOperator: Our next question comes from on John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.\nJohn Fox: I have a number of questions. First for Richie on the COVID losses in reinsurance. I'm just curious. I mean, that's to be expected. It's obviously, as Tom said, still an ongoing situation. But I'm just curious on the logistics of that, is that some loss that pops up, you get notified from one of your carriers that you're reinsuring? And is it new information for them? And just could you talk about the logistics of how that comes about?\nRichie Whitt: Well, certainly, as a reinsure, there's a bit of a delay in reporting. And obviously, COVID is a situation that's developing and it's the first time people have really seen the situation. So, it is taking a while for people to get their heads around how the losses might flow through the system. So I mean, what we're seeing is notifications that and mostly what we're seeing is notifications that people may be sending losses to us, I think there are very few instances of actual hard -- this is a loss that we're going to be putting to the treaty. So the great majority of what we have up today at the reinsurance operations is IBNR. My sense is, it's going to take quite a while for it all to play out, all the language has to be reviewed, there's probably going to be some negotiation between the cedents and the reinsurers. I wouldn't expect this to be resolved quickly. And, it's just prudent to hold the IBNR at this point.\nJohn Fox: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, by my calculations, which may not be correct, but I've been looking at your accident year, every quarter, which at least by my quotes has been running 105 plus for a lot of quarters historically. Now, it's closer to 100, or maybe even 98, 99. And I'm just like you to comment, is that observation accurate? And if so, what's the reason for that? I'm assuming three years of good price increases probably helps. But I think you just comment on that, thank you.\nRichie Whitt: Yes. I can't comment on your numbers, John. And maybe we can sync up later and get on the same page. We would actually say the current accident, your combined ratio was lower than that. But the direction, the trend you're talking about is absolutely true. On the lost side, it is, as you said, three years of price increases and term improvements. And then, there is -- don't forget the expense ratio component. Over the last few years, it's probably approaching three points off the expense ratio. So, your trend is absolutely correct. I can't confirm your numbers and we can maybe catch up later and try to get that sorted.\nJohn Fox: No, that's fine. The trend is correct, which is fine. And then, I have to admit, I'm struggling with Ventures with page 35, the disclosure on the gain. So it's the Ventures EBITDA, 81 minus 22. And that also has to come out of the revenue or I didn't understand. It's included in services and other expenses.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. The gain would be at the EBITDA line, it would not be in the revenue line. It was just within the business that was underperforming. We sold something that had $22 million gain on it.\nJohn Fox: Thank you.\nJeremy Noble: So you might be confused, but I hope you're at least happy.\nJohn Fox: I'm happy with the results. I am confused on some of the disclosure.\nJeremy Noble: The results are better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle: Several of my questions already been covered, but I'm on the reserve edition. Was that related to, most of the reinsurance book was contingency related, was it primarily related to the reserve edition?\nRichie Whitt: No, it is related to business interruption where I tell you the language, there's a lot of different language out there. And there's going to be a lot of negotiation on what is actually covered and what is not. But it would be instances where cedents believe they have an element of coverage for business interruption through their property reinsurance. And as I said, at this point, it's mostly notifications that we may have a loss that we're going to see to you very, very few hard and actual loss notifications. And so the great majority of the reserve is IBNR. And I do believe it's going to take quite a while for that all to be sorted out.\nMark Dwelle: Was it a, was it a U.S. cedent or is it non-U.S.?\nRichie Whitt: I don't know, Mark, whether it's U.S. or international probably some of both. I'm sure it was more than one just reviewing notifications that have come in.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Fair enough. Same question you mentioned and it was also mentioned for the first time in a little while in the 10-Q, about kind of the ramp up of Lodgepine, I admit, I kind of lost track of that thing. I think it was first established back in 2019. And maybe just an update of what's happening there and what you're hoping to accomplish in '21 with it?\nRichie Whitt: Sure. Well, in terms of the underwriting side of Lodgepine that got off the ground immediately and had a great year in 2020. So they were in the market wrote business. And from a retro standpoint, retro writers, I think had a really good year in 2020, most of the losses were retained by the insurance companies, or made it into reinsurance, but not to retro. The difficulty has been and I think we've talked about this just in terms of the ILS market in general, raising capital. It has been with COVID, with recent results in ILS, it has been a very long ramp up to raise the capital. We feel like we're within a whisker of raising that capital and sort of launching the fun side of things. But it has taken considerably longer than we ever would have guessed.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful. And then, the last question, mainly -- actually two questions. One related to the insurance business. When you characterize the growth, I mean, you talked about the rate increases. So I think you covered that. Within the balance of the growth, is that more associated with exposure unit growth within your insureds? Or is it more associated with kind of new business wins or gaining policy count?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. And I don't have details right in front of me right now, Mark, but if anything, we have been trying to shorten limits in a number of areas in the hardening market. It just makes sense try to get paid more for less exposure, if possible. So I would say I believe most of the growth that is out there, besides rate increases is going to be new policy count because as I said, in a number of areas, we are possible. We're asking underwriters to be very judicious with the amount of limit they're willing to put out.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Helpful on that. And then, the last question, maybe for Tom, I mean, you sounded particularly for your own conservative self relatively bullish about Markel Ventures for the upcoming year. And I guess the one question I wanted to maybe push back on just a little bit was -- is it seem like as a group of businesses, they were relatively less pandemic effected in the first place during last year. So is the growth simply just a recovery in those lines -- in those underlying businesses that were impacted? Or is it a more broad general inflation of the economy that you feel like you're capitalizing on?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. No, I think, first off, I want to say last year and the epidemic effect this business was swamped by the pandemic and set aside whatever journal entries or accounting you want, the human dimension of what was involved in those businesses and the effects on the people ever running them, there's just never been anything like it. And I'll remind you that it's over 15,000 people, mainly who work in factories doing field service distributed all around the country. Those are the frontline workers; they never missed a day of work. They were in the factory in the field every single day and the scrambling that took place to just keep everything on the rails, where you had to keep doing business in the way that you were doing it in many regards. For instance, one of the CEOs of Havco that makes the flooring in the back of a drive and trailer -- on the tractor trailer truck. He said, we can't make wood floors from home. So the impact of that business was immense and unprecedented. Clearly at the instant, where March 13 and the shutdown orders took place a lot of order books collapsed and you had shocks to the system. And again, I keep using the same two words amazed and grateful at how quickly both the management teams responded and figured out how to conduct and operate businesses and how fast the order books came back. And in fact started to top up and go further. So last year's results were very good. I think they represent sort of a phase shift and a change in the maturity and size and scale of what Markel Ventures is, relative to the total coming. But it's not something that's sort of a new baseline as you as we look in 2021 and 2022, we would expect the profitability that we saw last year to continue and to grow. And what gives me excitement is just to see the quality of the people that are running those businesses, how well they've done at a time of great testing and what kind of results they're putting on the board and how they're taking care of their customers and their people. It's just exciting to be part of it. So you pick up the right tone, in terms of optimism and bullishness and this is no longer a lab experiment. It's a big business matters.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. I appreciate the additional color. Thanks. Well, that's all my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Hi, this is Phil Stefano. Thanks for taking the question. So can you hear me okay.\nJeremy Noble: We can hear you.\nRichie Whitt: Yes, we got you.\nPhil Stefano: Sorry. I just wanted to make sure that was me. Richie, I appreciate the [show me state] [ph] reference, as we think about the evolution and the earned through of price and business mix changes is, is there an acceleration in the improvements of the underlying loss ratios as we look through this year? Or the conservatism kind of hold? I understood, you talked about reinsurance first quarter was a bit quirky and how that was reported. But just in thinking about the sequential changes in this as we look ahead.\nRichie Whitt: Yes. That's a great question. And I'm trying to think about how to answer it. I think it's fair to say, start with more likely redundant than deficient, we are going to try always to be more likely redundant than deficient. And we're going to be slow to recognize good news. Fast to recognize bad news. That's what we've always tried to do in terms of running our insurance businesses. I do not believe just because of how we think, I do not believe all of the rate increases that have been received in excess of claims inflation. I do not believe they're all baked into our combined ratio at this point. I can't tell you, I think it's 20% in there and 80%. To come 50:50, I don't know exactly. In good markets, things tend to get better than you expected, in bad markets, things to get worse than you expected. I do -- I guess the thing -- the best thing I can tell you is, I do not believe we have baked in to our attritional loss ratios at this point, all of the rate that we've been achieving.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. No, that's fair enough. So looking at reinsurance, I would have assumed that pulling out the cat business would have been a headwind for the attritional loss ratio. It probably would benefit I mean, absolutely volatility in the long run. But it feels like the commentary around the low 60s makes the lifter and pricing all that more impressive. Am I thinking about this right that the cat is coming out would have been a headwind that pricing is helping to offset?\nRichie Whitt: Yes. I would tell you, the first quarter is difficult to parse. It really is. Because of the wealth, the current accident, your loss ratio for -- we still had earned premiums from cat in the first quarter that had Uri in it. The thing I can tell you, we can go away and try to kind of think through pulling apart the numbers. The thing I can tell you is, on a go forward basis, we think the specialty, casualty professional book should be somewhere in the 60s. And I won't give a specific number, but that's what we're shooting for in terms of how we're pricing that business. So the first quarter had some anomalies in it with the transfer of the business -- some of the business over to the Nephila, the underwriting results of Lodgepine being in there, and just Uri, the losses on Uri being in there. So it is a little hard to pull apart.\nJeremy Noble: Hey, Phil. It\u2019s Jeremy. I will also maybe jump in there as well. I think that's an important point that Richie is making. It's going to take a little while for their earnings tail to run off. So our earned premium in property lines was so a comparable year-over-year. And some of that is because we are purchasing less reinsurance. So that benefits as well. So when you take the actual cat experience out, and you look at that attritional loss ratio, it's very low on the property lines, that still has earned premium that's going to fade away as we get into the year. And importantly, as we approach the mid-year, we really start cutting off risk in property as well. So we should have less exposure and less volatility. And you'll start seeing the blended result in the reinsurance segment really being the combination of our casualty professional and specialty line. And that will blend to be as Richie was commenting earlier, slightly higher than what we see on an attritional basis in the first quarter.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Switching gears to the Venture business, I guess, when I tried to tease out the Lansing impact, it feels like the first quarter underlying revenue was still down high single digits. And I think that's the pace that we saw in the back half of 2020 as well. Tom, how economically sensitive is this business to the go forward rebound in the economy? Or is -- do you feel like these underlying growth areas kind of hit a nadir and we pivot as we look forward?\nTom Gayner: Well, I think directionally, your numbers in the sensation of the portfolio prior to Lansing, top-line revenue numbers are correct. And I would describe a lot of that happened because of the shock that would have happened on March 13 when you shut the economy down. Through 2020, all of the businesses recovered as time goes by. So it got better as the year went on. To answer your second question, how cyclical are they? There are a lot of cyclical businesses in there that are highly exposed to things like transportation, freight volumes, new car sales, things of that nature. And I want to hearken back to look at the language that I put in the annual report, we've put those five year buckets because that's really how we think about things and look at what has happened. We've got 15 years. So there's three five year buckets. And if you look at the results of the cash flows, EBITDA, the net income, however you want to categorize it or look at it, and you look at it in those five year bucket terms. That's a very up into the right chart that we're looking at. Secondly, I want to pick up on a point that Richie made and answered to some of the questions about the reporting, what the pace of things being apparently getting better. He said, we are quick to recognize bad news and slow to recognize good news. That's true for ventures as well. We don't have a different philosophy or a different culture when it comes to reporting the ventures results, as opposed to the insurance results. And one of the points I was trying to make about the culture and the size of the scale being large now is, in the early years of any deal where you have purchase accounting and the amortization of goodwill and customer lists and all of those sorts of things, proportionally, they would tend to be the heaviest at the beginning and diminish over time. Now if we were interested in sort of managing earnings per share, we would work a little harder about trying to smooth that out and make it paint a prettier picture on day one. We don't care about that. We care about the cash returns and the earnings that the businesses themselves produce. And we want that to be sustainable over an indefinite long-term period of time. So it's only after a couple of years that they're part of the family and part of the company, that the accounting conservativism sort of burns off. And you start to be able to discern the true underlying economic performance of that business. And so that, in reality is what is happening, you want to see hard, physical, visual evidence of it, look at the annual report letter, and look at the five year buckets and see how you feel.\nPhil Stefano: So just one more, and then I'll get back in line, I guess, in my mind, on the insurance business, one of the things that allows you to be slow to recognize the good news and quick to recognize the bad news is that the cost of goods sold is much less transparent. Then in my mind, it is in the ventures business, I guess what flexibility do you have in the ventures reporting to allow enough flexibility, maybe that's not the good word. But what optionality do you have in the ventures reporting that allows you to have that mindset?\nTom Gayner: Well, not as much as I would like, quite frankly. So the purchase accounting rules, which change from time to time, and these are GAAP under the auspices of PCAOB, impose things. And I do remind people that I was formally trained as an accountant, I am a CPA non-practicing and I look at some of the accounting rules, shall we call them and I try to think of them with my financial hat on, an economic hat on and cash hat on as opposed to GAAP hat on. And the accountants around here get tired of my lectures on these sorts of things. But it doesn't matter and I don't care. What we care about is, is the cash earnings of the business and the growth and the returns on capital and those are up into the right. So we're slow, it's painful in the current years and the freshness of a deal, because from the inside perspective, where I know the business and I see what's happening, it's better than it looks. And it just takes a period of time before it looks as good as it is. And you know the size and scale absent a large deal, we're starting to get to the point where it's starting to look as good as it is. Now, if we do a big deal, we'll start that clock all over again but the denominator and the size and scale of the Markel Ventures entirety right now means that the incremental effect of any new deal is probably a lot less than what it used to be. And again, I just keep getting back to that notion. If you really want to be able to draw hard lines and reconcile them to GAAP accounting. Look at those five year charts. All right, maybe Phil is out there looking at them. I think we've lost them. We might be having some technical difficulties.\nOperator: Please go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session here. I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: All right, perfect. Thank you so much for joining us. We're happy to report the kind of news we were able to do. We look forward to continuing to do so. As time goes by and before do seeing you at our annual meeting on May 10 in Richmond, Virginia. We will be live and in person and anybody who can join us, we'd love to see you. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you so much good morning and welcome to the Markel Corporation first quarter conference call. This is Tom Gayner and I'm joined today by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt and our CFO Jeremy Noble. The purpose of today's call is to give you a brief update on our business and answer any questions you might have about Markel. Well, what a difference a year makes, in my opinion, the first quarter of last year, ranked as the toughest 90 days in the history of the Markel Corporation. It felt more like 90 years than 90 days. This year's first quarter report is better, a lot better. A year ago, despite the very real, tangible, and intangible costs from the shock of COVID-19, we pressed on, we persisted. The people of Markel demonstrated their resilience, skills, and adaptability, and they produce significant rebounds in every aspect of our business as the year went on. Today, we're pleased to report to you another milestone of progress. Each of our three engines of insurance, investments and Markel Ventures produced positive results in the first quarter, and we're optimistic about their prospects. We know we've got more work to do. There's always more work to do. We're excited to be able to report to you results from our insurance operations that are in line with our stated goals of growth and profitability that we outlined in our 10-5-1 initiative. We're pleased with the improved profitability and risk reductions in our reinsurance business. We're earning appropriate and disciplined returns from our investments, Markel Ventures continues to earn excellent returns, which increases the durability and value of the Markel Corporation, and we're optimistic they will achieve meaningfully better results in our insurance-linked securities operations. Jeremy will review the headline numbers from the quarter, and then Richie will cover the insurance, ILS, and state/national operations. I'll come back to chat about investments in Markel Ventures. And then, we will open the floor for questions. With that, Jeremy. Thank you, Richie. In our ventures operations, the headline numbers show revenues of 707 million compared to 511 million a year ago, an EBITDA of 81 million compared to 67 million as is usually the case though, there's more going on than what spotlighted in headlines. As to revenues, the biggest reason for the increase is the inclusion of Lansing. Typically the first quarter is seasonally the lightest for Lansing, as well as several other of our businesses. And I would expect normal seasonal increases and profitability as the year progresses. As to the increase in EBITDA, we recognize the gain from the sale of a facility within one of our healthcare operations. I would point out that transaction should give you some insight into the conservativism of the accounting in place at Markel Ventures. We've struggled a bit with our healthcare operations and the fact that we could sell a facility in an underperforming business and that would yield a gain should give you some comfort that we're not braggy when it comes to how we're reporting our results to you. For years, we've publicly stated and committed to conservativism in the presentation of our insurance results. We've operated with a goal of being more likely redundant than deficient when setting insurance reserves and I hope you take some comfort from that spirit and culture of conservativism exist at Markel Ventures as well. For the entirety of Markel Ventures, this year's first quarter was a COVID quarter to use a phrase, while our first quarter of last year was pre-COVID. We've had BC and AD as conventions to describe dates for a few millennia. For at least a little while longer, I think will distinguish the current era as PC, DC and AC. Tom Hanks was the first person I heard break up time into those categories and he is a hand veteran of the path. Personally, I'm looking forward to the AC period, but it's not here yet. I continue to be grateful and amazed for the performance throughout the Markel Ventures organization. The results are excellent. They also require more work per unit of output compared to pre-COVID circumstances. Economic activity and order books are very good. There is plenty of business to be had. And we're getting our fair share of fulfilling orders and producing goods and services is getting harder. Our ventures CEOs use new words like supply chain roulette when describing the daily realities of their business. Labor shortages and inflation are facts of life. Your team is doing an outstanding job of coping and adjusting with the realities on the ground. But what I see in real-time from real businesses seems different than many news reports and comments from officials about inflation. If current economic and financial markets conditions continue to prevail, we should enjoy record results and revenues and EBITDA this year from Markel Ventures. In the current price environment of very low interest rates and very high transaction price multiples. I do not expect us to make sizable acquisitions in 2021. We've got an excellent capital position, a lot of dry powder and a great network of CEOs and relationships that keep us connected to opportunities. But I think we're better off focusing on our existing operations and organic growth opportunities at this time. We'll adjust as circumstances change and that ability to change is a fundamentally attractive feature of our overall structure at Markel. On the investment front, we are to 8% on our equity portfolio during the first quarter. In our fixed income operations, we posted a negative 1.3% return, which occurred entirely due to rises in interest rates. There were zero credit losses in the portfolio. The total portfolio after all expenses and foreign currency adjustments, rose 1.4%. In any one quarter and frankly, in any one year, expect a lot of volatility from investments. We make no efforts to dampen volatility artificially through expensive derivatives, or the difference between publicly traded mark-to-market valuation practices versus private self reported valuation marks. We just stick to the fundamental and basic task of trying to earn the best returns we can over long periods of time. Currently, our capital position is quite strong. We've accumulated higher than normal cash positions. Fortunately, that cash supports our current growth in insurance underwriting opportunities, which carry the expectations of meaningful returns. As time goes by and capital continues to build, we expect to be able to apply capital to all four components of our capital allocation triage ladder. We're currently funding the organic growth of our insurance businesses. We've got ample capital to fund growth initiatives within our ventures operations. We're modestly adding to our publicly traded securities portfolio. We're open minded about potential acquisitions when opportunities arrive, all as they always do eventually and we are repurchasing our shares. We will continue to incur the small opportunity cost of carrying large cash balances until conditions change. We are not interested in locking in low long-term rates of return. We will continue to be opportunistic as we look at any investment decisions. To close, we're pleased with the progress we're reporting to you this morning. We've got demonstrated wonderful results in our insurance business, improving results in our reinsurance business, demonstrated wonderful results in our Markel Ventures operations, appropriate returns in our investment portfolio and gritted teeth determination to improve results in our insurance like securities operations. I love our culture and I like our hand. With that, we welcome the opportunity to answer your questions. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I think both of those are a little abnormal just as a result of what we're doing in terms of property and some of the other issues that happened in the quarter. I think the low 60s is probably about the right place in terms of an attritional loss ratio and maybe a tick higher on the expense ratio. We are pricing, I did say, this in my comments, the team is trying to price everything at a 90 or lower that they're putting on the books, but we're not going to see that show up in our results for a while. And two reasons, we're still earning premium that was put on books in prior years and maybe didn't have as strong rate increases. And secondly, just our conservatism, we want to be more likely redundant than deficient. We were coming off a few years of tough performance in reinsurance. We're going to be from Missouri in terms of the results for a while. So, while we're pricing it at less than 90, my goal would be something in the mid 90s in terms of what we could do this year. It would be my expectation that the actual inflation that's really taking place on the ground is more than what the headlines would report. So all of the managers who live and eat and sleep and breathe these businesses every day, they're doing the best they can to control their costs, to get their supply chains on and working and making sure that they're charging appropriately prices to earn a good margin of whatever product or service they're providing. That's true every day. That's true in the public securities portfolio of the companies we look at. And we're really looking for the same kind of behavior from the managers of our businesses at Markel Ventures, as we expect from the managers of the public traded companies that we're investing in. And that really doesn't change whether inflation is low or high. But I don't want to be caught asleep at the wheel and not aware of the heightened sensitivity and focus that I think should be applied to that line of thought these days. And to sum it up and I think I mentioned it in the comments. We think the dumbest thing you could do right now is to lock in low long-term rates of return. So we don't claim to be geniuses, or the smartest people in the room, but we try not to be the dumbest so as long as we don't do stupid things good things compound. Well, I think directionally, your numbers in the sensation of the portfolio prior to Lansing, top-line revenue numbers are correct. And I would describe a lot of that happened because of the shock that would have happened on March 13 when you shut the economy down. Through 2020, all of the businesses recovered as time goes by. So it got better as the year went on. To answer your second question, how cyclical are they?

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thank you, Jeremy and good morning everyone. A strong momentum from the last half of 2020 continued in the first quarter of '21 as we achieved a combined ratio of 94%, which includes four points of cat losses from winter storm Uri and one point of losses attributable to adverse development related to COVID-19. Obviously, compared to the unprecedented impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and results in the first quarter of 2020, we're pleased to be able to report a solid start to the year. You know there's an old golf saying that you can't win the tournament on the first day but you certainly can lose it. Despite starting the year with a slightly higher combined ratio due to the unprecedented winter storms, we believe we are still well positioned to win the tournament and achieve our previously stated underwriting profitability goals for the full year. Sure, I absolutely would have love to start the year on the right side of 90% combined but I feel like we're in striking distance. Many of the tailwinds, we've discussed in our last call remain in play with their ability to achieve meaningful rate increases across almost all insurance and reinsurance product lines, resulting in reductions in our first quarter 2021 attritional loss ratios. We continue to find areas to add new business and program opportunities and take full advantage of the current market environment, while also engaging in continuous portfolio management aimed at improving profitability and reducing overall volatility. Now I will discuss our insurance operations, which include our underwriting operations, state national program services operations and insurance linked securities operations. So let's get started with the insurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter in our insurance segment were up 224 million were 16% and earned premiums were up $137 million or 12% compared to 2020. Premium growth was driven by continued strong new business growth, along with the impact from rate increases across several product lines, most notably our professional liability, general liability, marine and energy and personal lines products. Virtually all of our growth continues to be in our preferred product offerings. We continue to see favorable rating environments within several of our product lines, with the exception of workers compensation and we look to continue to take advantage of these market opportunities. The combined ratio for the insurance segment for the first quarter was 91% versus 119% in the same period last year. The 28 point combined ratio decrease was primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 losses in 2020 compared to much smaller cat losses in 2021. We recognize 39 million or three points of losses in the first quarter of '21 related to winter storm Uri versus $293 million or 27 points related to losses from COVID-19 last year. Besides the impact from COVID and cat losses events within our ongoing operations, we also reported a three point reduction in our 2021 current accident year attritional loss ratio. This decrease was driven primarily by the impact of premium rate increases across several of the product lines I previously mentioned. In addition, we benefited from a two point reduction in our expense ratio, due to the impact of higher earned premiums, efficiency efforts and expense control. Turning to the reinsurance segment, gross written premiums for the quarter were up 19 million or 4% and earned premiums were up 28 million or 12% compared to last year. Premium growth was driven by new business due to significant new treaties in our general liability and professional liability lines, where we see attractive opportunities. As we've said in the past, individual contracts can have significant impacts on our premium writings. The growth that we saw in general liability and professional liability really related to three new contracts that we thought were good opportunities in the first quarter. This was partially offset by lower premiums in our property product line. As a reminder, during the first quarter of this year, we executed on our planned transition of our reinsurance property lines from a reinsurance underwriting operations to be managed by our Nephila ILS operations as part of our ongoing strategy to match risk to the most appropriate capital. We will continue to see impacts from the reinsurance treaty transition throughout the remainder of the year within the results of our reinsurance segment. The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment for the first quarter was up 2021 was 109% compared to 115% last year. The 2021 combined ratio was primarily driven by the impact of cap and COVID-19 losses, where we recognized 25 million or 10 points of losses related to Winter Storm Uri and 19 million or seven points of adverse prior accident year development related to COVID-19. The 2020 combined ratio included 32 million or 14 points related to losses from COVID-19. In addition, the 2021 combined ratio was favorably impacted by a decrease in our current accident year. Attritional loss ratio primarily within our property product lines and from a lower expense ratio due to the impact of higher earned premiums. While our reinsurance segment results are still not where they need to be, we achieved significant growth in our more profitable general liability and professional liability product lines this quarter and saw a favorable trends in both our current accident year attritional loss ratio and expense ratio compared to the same period a year ago. We are working hard to price all 2021 business to a 90% combined ratio or lower. The difference between the 2021 reported current accident year combined ratio and that pricing target is the result of earnings on business written in previous years and are consistent application of Markel's reserving philosophy, which is to set reserves at a level that are more likely redundant than deficient. Next I'll touch on our program services and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Gross written premium volume for our state national program services operation increased by 56% to $612 million versus $393 million a year ago. Premium growth was due to the expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. Premium in the first quarter of 2020 were impacted by one-time unfavorable adjustment of 55 million related to the enforced cancellation of a particular program. The overall increase in premiums under management also favorably impacted our operating revenues and margin in the quarter. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services operations is seeded. We continue to see a strong pipeline of program services opportunities in the current market. Next, I'll discuss our ILS operations. Our ILS operations consist of the results of Nephila plus startup expenses related to large five. For the quarter operating revenues within our ILS operations decreased due to lower investment management fees related to having lower assets under management versus the same period a year ago. Assets under management at Nephila were 9.5 billion as of March 31, 2021. Earnings also continued to be impacted by cost associated with building and supporting the growth of Nephila's two MGA platforms, as well as preparing for the launch of additional fund investment vehicles. Nephila continues to build and identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital and launch new investment opportunities. Finally, I'd like to point out that we made a change in our disclosures this quarter to recognize the runoff nature of the CATco operations by moving those results out of the ILS operating revenues and expenses and into other for all periods presented. CATco continues to make solid progress to the quarterly wind down if its operations and currently has approximately 900 million in AUM. I'll finish up with some market commentary. Trends in the first quarter were very similar to trends we discussed on our last call. We see continued pricing momentum in almost all lines. The glaring exception I guess is workers comp, our insurance and reinsurance rate increases averaged over -- average double digits in the first quarter. Reinsurance pricing, which as we've previously discussed has lagged primary insurance pricing closed the gap some more during the first quarter and during the January 1 renewals. But it's still not as strong as rates being achieved in the primary market. This continuing dynamic obviously explains our continued double-digit growth in insurance versus roughly flat in reinsurance. As we've discussed, while new entrants and incremental capital raises certainly have impacted the market around the edges, we believe that this pricing momentum will continue due to a multitude of factors such as low interest rates, the continued elevated cat activity, social inflation, further COVID-19 impacts and economic uncertainties that are likely to persist throughout 2021. We do note that there seems to be much discussion recently of a moderation of rate increases. While it certainly does appear to us that rates are not going up at the same pace that they have over the last several quarters. We really do not view this as a cause for alarm. We're in the third year of meaningful rate increases which creates a compounding impact. It would be unrealistic to think that rates could continue to accelerate indefinitely. Also, it's worth pointing out the dynamics of all lines are not the same. While D&O price increases are beginning to stabilize cyber prices are on the way up given recent loss events and as insurance and reinsurance capacity has decreased. In our view, the overall market picture remains extremely healthy. We're also starting to see the benefit to our business as the economy recovers from the impacts of COVID-19. People probably obviously saw first quarter GDP increasing at 6.4%. Small businesses, which is a meaningful part of our portfolio is starting to show signs of recovery and it is showing up in our premium writings. To sum up the first quarter, we're off to a solid start and are excited to continue to move our business steadily forward over the rest of the year. Thanks for your time today and now, I will turn it over to Tom. Hey, Jeff. It's Richie. I think it's a number of factors. I pointed out, we're in the third year of rate increases. It gets harder to sell continued double-digit rate increases after you do that a couple of times. So, I mean, there is a point at which things have to level off. So, I think that is part of it. We've been in through a couple of renewal cycles and continued double-digit rate increases get harder and harder to sell. There's certainly competition always is; and certainly as you know rates, as people start to see rates go up and they have their opinion as to where those are versus rate adequacy, obviously the higher they go, the more people feel like, hey, that's a good risk and I should maybe jump in on it. So, I think it's just the signs of a healthy market. I mean, that is what's going to happen. As I said, I mean, we really did not see, I mean, we were pretty flat, quite honestly, in the first quarter, looking at rate increases versus fourth quarter. I know some people talked about being down a bit. We were sort of flattish and that growth maybe we'll see that growth dip below flat in the second quarter but still double digits in both insurance and reinsurance. The rest of the year is going to -- we will have to see how it plays out. The issue with reinsurance given are relatively small portfolio roughly $1 billion is individual deals can really move the numbers around. And so, as I said we did three deals and they ebbed up to around $90 million. I mean, so in reinsurance, individual deals can be elephant hunting. So, we found three deals that we really liked in the first quarter, I can't be certain we'll find three deals in the second quarter or any deals in the third or fourth quarter, so we're going to be very opportunistic the rest of the year, and if we think there's good deals out there that we want to write, we'll put them on the books, but if not we could be down quarter-to-quarter. So this year is all about profitability and being opportunistic. So it's going to be a little hard to give you guidance on how the next three quarters play out in terms of premium volume. Yes, it is. Our retentions on our property business were lower because of the cat protection that we bought -- reinsurance protection that we bought. We tend to keep much more of our casualty, professional, and specialty business net, so those retentions should go up. That's a great question. I can tell you, we've been frustrated. We feel like we make two steps forward. And then there's a step backwards, Uri in the first quarter and we have losses and that obviously reduces AUM, reduces fees. It's been a tough four years in the ILS business with the cats. But we can't make excuses, we have to figure out a way to get our business moving forward. So certainly we project the business moving forward the rest of the year and certainly wanted to move forward in '22 and onward. But, we got work to do. And there's just no other way to say it, we've got work to do, to get where we want to be in ILS. And part of that is, hopefully fewer cats, but the bigger part of it is getting the right price for the exposure. So I and have a lot of other people believe prices need to continue to go up for cat risk. Well, certainly, as a reinsure, there's a bit of a delay in reporting. And obviously, COVID is a situation that's developing and it's the first time people have really seen the situation. So, it is taking a while for people to get their heads around how the losses might flow through the system. So I mean, what we're seeing is notifications that and mostly what we're seeing is notifications that people may be sending losses to us, I think there are very few instances of actual hard -- this is a loss that we're going to be putting to the treaty. So the great majority of what we have up today at the reinsurance operations is IBNR. My sense is, it's going to take quite a while for it all to play out, all the language has to be reviewed, there's probably going to be some negotiation between the cedents and the reinsurers. I wouldn't expect this to be resolved quickly. And, it's just prudent to hold the IBNR at this point. Yes. I can't comment on your numbers, John. And maybe we can sync up later and get on the same page. We would actually say the current accident, your combined ratio was lower than that. But the direction, the trend you're talking about is absolutely true. On the lost side, it is, as you said, three years of price increases and term improvements. And then, there is -- don't forget the expense ratio component. Over the last few years, it's probably approaching three points off the expense ratio. So, your trend is absolutely correct. I can't confirm your numbers and we can maybe catch up later and try to get that sorted. No, it is related to business interruption where I tell you the language, there's a lot of different language out there. And there's going to be a lot of negotiation on what is actually covered and what is not. But it would be instances where cedents believe they have an element of coverage for business interruption through their property reinsurance. And as I said, at this point, it's mostly notifications that we may have a loss that we're going to see to you very, very few hard and actual loss notifications. And so the great majority of the reserve is IBNR. And I do believe it's going to take quite a while for that all to be sorted out. I don't know, Mark, whether it's U.S. or international probably some of both. I'm sure it was more than one just reviewing notifications that have come in. Sure. Well, in terms of the underwriting side of Lodgepine that got off the ground immediately and had a great year in 2020. So they were in the market wrote business. And from a retro standpoint, retro writers, I think had a really good year in 2020, most of the losses were retained by the insurance companies, or made it into reinsurance, but not to retro. The difficulty has been and I think we've talked about this just in terms of the ILS market in general, raising capital. It has been with COVID, with recent results in ILS, it has been a very long ramp up to raise the capital. We feel like we're within a whisker of raising that capital and sort of launching the fun side of things. But it has taken considerably longer than we ever would have guessed. Yes. And I don't have details right in front of me right now, Mark, but if anything, we have been trying to shorten limits in a number of areas in the hardening market. It just makes sense try to get paid more for less exposure, if possible. So I would say I believe most of the growth that is out there, besides rate increases is going to be new policy count because as I said, in a number of areas, we are possible. We're asking underwriters to be very judicious with the amount of limit they're willing to put out. Yes. No, I think, first off, I want to say last year and the epidemic effect this business was swamped by the pandemic and set aside whatever journal entries or accounting you want, the human dimension of what was involved in those businesses and the effects on the people ever running them, there's just never been anything like it. And I'll remind you that it's over 15,000 people, mainly who work in factories doing field service distributed all around the country. Those are the frontline workers; they never missed a day of work. They were in the factory in the field every single day and the scrambling that took place to just keep everything on the rails, where you had to keep doing business in the way that you were doing it in many regards. For instance, one of the CEOs of Havco that makes the flooring in the back of a drive and trailer -- on the tractor trailer truck. He said, we can't make wood floors from home. So the impact of that business was immense and unprecedented. Clearly at the instant, where March 13 and the shutdown orders took place a lot of order books collapsed and you had shocks to the system. And again, I keep using the same two words amazed and grateful at how quickly both the management teams responded and figured out how to conduct and operate businesses and how fast the order books came back. And in fact started to top up and go further. So last year's results were very good. I think they represent sort of a phase shift and a change in the maturity and size and scale of what Markel Ventures is, relative to the total coming. But it's not something that's sort of a new baseline as you as we look in 2021 and 2022, we would expect the profitability that we saw last year to continue and to grow. And what gives me excitement is just to see the quality of the people that are running those businesses, how well they've done at a time of great testing and what kind of results they're putting on the board and how they're taking care of their customers and their people. It's just exciting to be part of it. So you pick up the right tone, in terms of optimism and bullishness and this is no longer a lab experiment. It's a big business matters. Yes, we got you. Yes. That's a great question. And I'm trying to think about how to answer it. I think it's fair to say, start with more likely redundant than deficient, we are going to try always to be more likely redundant than deficient. And we're going to be slow to recognize good news. Fast to recognize bad news. That's what we've always tried to do in terms of running our insurance businesses. I do not believe just because of how we think, I do not believe all of the rate increases that have been received in excess of claims inflation. I do not believe they're all baked into our combined ratio at this point. I can't tell you, I think it's 20% in there and 80%. To come 50:50, I don't know exactly. In good markets, things tend to get better than you expected, in bad markets, things to get worse than you expected. I do -- I guess the thing -- the best thing I can tell you is, I do not believe we have baked in to our attritional loss ratios at this point, all of the rate that we've been achieving. Yes. I would tell you, the first quarter is difficult to parse. It really is. Because of the wealth, the current accident, your loss ratio for -- we still had earned premiums from cat in the first quarter that had Uri in it. The thing I can tell you, we can go away and try to kind of think through pulling apart the numbers. The thing I can tell you is, on a go forward basis, we think the specialty, casualty professional book should be somewhere in the 60s. And I won't give a specific number, but that's what we're shooting for in terms of how we're pricing that business. So the first quarter had some anomalies in it with the transfer of the business -- some of the business over to the Nephila, the underwriting results of Lodgepine being in there, and just Uri, the losses on Uri being in there. So it is a little hard to pull apart."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. As Tom said what a difference a year makes. Our first-quarter 2021 results showcased the benefits that come from operating our diverse three-engine model with our insurance, investments, and ventures operations, each performing well and adding value in the quarter. Looking at our operating results, gross written premiums were $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of 13%. This increase was largely attributable to our insurance segment, which reported gross written premiums of $1.6 billion, an increase of 16% compared to the same period of 2020. Our increased premium volume reflects both strong growth in new business as well as ongoing favorable pricing trends, both of which are most prominent within our professional liability and general liability product lines, but also experienced within our personal lines and marine and energy product lines. Within our reinsurance segment, gross written premiums increased 4% to $533 million. Also reflecting growth in our general liability and professional liability product lines, partially offset by lower premium volume on our property product lines, given our decision to transfer this portfolio to Nephila late last year. Retention in gross written premiums was 87% in 2021, which is up two points from the same period last year, primarily driven by changes in the mix of business within our reinsurance segment. Earned premiums increased 13% to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same period last year, primarily due to higher written premium volume in our insurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2021 was 94, which included $64 million or four points of losses attributable to a winter storm Uri and $19 million or one point of adverse development arising from a change in our estimates of the COVID-19 ultimate losses. This compares to a 118 combined ratio for the same period last year, which included 24 points of losses attributed to the COVID-19. Excluding the loss impacts of winter storm Uri and COVID-19 in both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2021 was an 88 compared to a 94 in the same period of 2020. This improvement reflects a four point improvement in our attritional loss ratio and a two-point improvement in our expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior-year loss reserves developed favorably by $91 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $104 million in the first quarter 2020. Favorable development on prioryear actuary loss reserves in the first quarter of 2021 was net of the $19 million of adverse development related to COVID-19 that I just mentioned, all of which was within our reinsurance segment on our property product line arising from updated and new loss information from cedents. Turning to our investment results, net investment gains included in net income were $527 million in the first quarter 2021 and were primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2020 attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by unfavorable market value movements resulting from the onset of the pandemic. As I've mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability, and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, we may continue to see volatility in the equity markets. With regards to net investment income, we reported $97 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $88 million in the same period last year. The increase this quarter reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments in the first quarter of last year, partially offset by lower short-term investment income due to lower short-term interest rates during the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter 2020. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $214 million net of taxes during the first quarter of 2021, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates during the first quarter of 2021. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues for Markel Ventures increased $707 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $511 million in the comparable quarter last year. This increase reflects the contributions of revenues from our April 2020 acquisition of Lansing Building Products. Excluding the contributions of Lansing in the first quarter of 2021, operating revenues in our Markel Ventures operations decreased compared to 2020 as a result of lower sales volumes, primarily our transportation related and consulting services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $81 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $67 million during the same period last year. The year-over-year increases attributed to a gain recognized in connection with the sale of a portion of one of our healthcare businesses. EBITDA from our other Markel Ventures operations decreased due to the impact of lower operating revenues at our transportation-related and consulting services businesses this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2020. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 20% compared to 21% in the first quarter a year ago. We reported net income to common shareholders of $574 million for the first quarter of this year, compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $1.4 billion in the same period a year ago. Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first quarter of this year was $359 million, compared to a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.4 billion first quarter a year ago. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows capital on our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $318 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $66 million for the first quarter last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2021 reflecting the impact of higher premium volume as we continue to see strong growth in our insurance segment. Invested assets of the holding company were $4 billion at the end of March compared to $4.1 billion at the end of the year. Total shareholders equity stood at $13.2 billion at the end of March, up from $12.8 billion at the end of the year. During the quarter we repurchased just under 20,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. Overall, a very pleasing quarter from both a top and bottom-line within each of our three engines. Financial condition of the company remains strong and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses. Yes, there is. And we are doing that. Yes. The gain would be at the EBITDA line, it would not be in the revenue line. It was just within the business that was underperforming. We sold something that had $22 million gain on it. So you might be confused, but I hope you're at least happy. The results are better. We can hear you. Hey, Phil. It's Jeremy. I will also maybe jump in there as well. I think that's an important point that Richie is making. It's going to take a little while for their earnings tail to run off. So our earned premium in property lines was so a comparable year-over-year. And some of that is because we are purchasing less reinsurance. So that benefits as well. So when you take the actual cat experience out, and you look at that attritional loss ratio, it's very low on the property lines, that still has earned premium that's going to fade away as we get into the year. And importantly, as we approach the mid-year, we really start cutting off risk in property as well. So we should have less exposure and less volatility. And you'll start seeing the blended result in the reinsurance segment really being the combination of our casualty professional and specialty line. And that will blend to be as Richie was commenting earlier, slightly higher than what we see on an attritional basis in the first quarter."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Gayner: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As Brian-Doyle Murray said in Groundhog Day, \u201crise and shine, campers, don\u2019t forget your booties because it\u2019s coooold outside.\u201d Happy Groundhog Day from Richmond, Virginia, where we\u2019re getting our first snow of the season, doesn\u2019t happen very often around here. So, I just couldn\u2019t let the occasion pass without saying something. This is Tom Gayner, not Brian-Doyle Murray. I\u2019m your CEO, and it\u2019s my pleasure to welcome you to the Markel Corporation year-end conference call. I\u2019m joined today by Brian Costanzo, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance operations. On today\u2019s call, Brian will give you a rundown on the financial results we just reported and Jeremy will follow with some comments on our insurance operations. I\u2019ll come back after them with a few thoughts about our ventures and investment operations, and then we will open the floor for any questions you might have. As a public company, the cadence of these calls is every 90 days. Each quarter, we share our financial results with you as we hold this call. While we update you one quarter at a time, let me assure you that is not the cadence we follow in managing Markel. Our North Star remains the dual time horizon of forever and right now. We believe that the combination of the long-term time horizon embodied by the concept of forever, coupled with the discipline and urgency of the right now provides a balance that serves us well. Quarters are like the rings inside the trunk of a mighty sequoia tree that give you a useful piece of information about one small chapter in the life of the tree, but any given ring is just one in a sequence of many. Given our long-term focus, one of the ways we monitor our results is to look at some key numbers in five-year buckets. We use five-year increments to gain perspective. We also tie our incentive compensation calculations for executive management to five-year results to demonstrate our commitment to long-term performance. For your consideration, here are some of the five-year numbers for the year that just ended: One, from 2018 to 2022, we reported total revenues of just over $50 billion, up from $26.5 billion in the previous five-year period. That\u2019s an increase of roughly 90%. Two, we reported earned premiums from our insurance operations of $29.5 billion, up from $19 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 55%. Three, we reported underwriting profits of $1.8 billion, up from $821 million. That\u2019s an increase of 116%. Four, we reported ILS and program services revenues of $1.7 billion, up from $44 million. That\u2019s an increase of 3,763.64%, and I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate that particular number if I were in your shoes. Five, we reported Markel Ventures revenues of just over $15 billion, up from just over $5 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 200%. Sixth, we reported Markel Ventures EBITDA of $1.7 billion, up from $600 million. That\u2019s an increase of 183%. Seven, we reported net investment income of $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion. That\u2019s an increase of about 18%. Eight, we reported comprehensive income of $3.7 billion, up from $3.5 billion. That\u2019s an increase of 6%. And finally, nine, the price per share ended at $1,317 up from $1,139 five years ago. That\u2019s an increase of about 15%. I hope you would share my sense of forward progress at Markel of meaningful amounts measured in meaningful amounts of time. We\u2019re excited and pleased with most, but not all of those numbers, and we\u2019re optimistic that as we grew the next five-year batch, we\u2019ll be pleased with each line of that report. In the next five years, if we make the same sort of progress on the first eight items on the list, I\u2019ll be surprised if the ninth line doesn\u2019t follow. With that update and comment on the five-year numbers, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the 2022 results.\nBrian Costanzo: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m happy to be with you all this morning to report the numbers from our 2022 results. Our insurance and Markel Ventures operations delivered strong operating results while navigating a complex macroeconomic environment, and we\u2019re pleased with the steady growth we\u2019re seeing in the investment income generated on the investment portfolio. While the volatility in the equity and bond markets created unrealized losses in the portfolio this year, we remain focused on long-term investment performance, which better reflects the quality and durability of our investment portfolio. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums surpassed $9.8 billion for the year compared to $8.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 16%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, strong policy retention levels, continued increases in rates and expanded product offerings. Our professional liability and general liability product lines continue to lead the way, but we\u2019ve also achieved meaningful growth across many of our other product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio was 92% in 2022, which included $46 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian and $36 million of net losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict for a combined 1 point impact to the combined ratio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our initial estimate for losses attributed to Hurricane Ian by $24 million. Our estimate for net losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognized in the first quarter and remain unchanged throughout the year. In 2021, our consolidated combined ratio was 90%, which included $195 million or 3 points of losses on natural catastrophes. Excluding these event losses from both years, our consolidated combined ratio in 2022 was 91% compared to an 87% for 2021. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $167 million in 2022 compared to $480 million in 2021. In 2022, we experienced adverse development on certain of our general liability and professional liability product lines within our insurance segment in the 2016 through 2019 accident years, primarily arising from unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity trends. As discussed in the third quarter, the impacts of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims, particularly on our longer tail product lines. And as a result, we are approaching reductions to prior year loss reserves cautiously, particularly on more recent accident years. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increased loss reserves following indications of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our expectations. Whereas in instances where claim trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we are often waiting to reduce our loss reserves, and we\u2019ll evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. Turning next to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income were $1.6 billion in 2022 and were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the year. This compares to net investment gains of $2 billion in 2021 attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market movements. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, and we continue to maintain our investing discipline, understanding that periodic declines in the equity markets are to be expected and will result in variability in the timing of investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of December, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $4.6 billion. With regards to net investment income, we reported $447 million in 2022 compared to $367 million in 2021. It\u2019s worth noting that these amounts are now comprised entirely of our recurring interest and dividend income from the investment portfolio. Previously, net investment income also included the income or loss recognized on our equity method investments, which are managed separately from the rest of the investment portfolio, the results from which are now included in other revenues. The increase in net investment income in 2022 reflects the benefit of higher interest rates on our short-term investments and cash equivalents during the last half of the year as yields on these investments have increased sharply from nearly 0% a year ago. We are also beginning to see the benefit of higher interest rates within our fixed maturity portfolio through recent purchases at higher yield rates. That impact will become more meaningful in future periods as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases of fixed maturity securities began to exceed the average book yield on the portfolio. Net unrealized investment losses included in our comprehensive income in 2022 totaled $1.1 billion net of taxes, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. As a reminder, we typically hold our fixed maturity securities until maturity, and we generally expect unrealized losses or gains to reverse in future periods as the bonds mature. Our portfolio has an average rating of AAA, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now, I\u2019ll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 31% to $4.8 billion in 2022 compared to $3.6 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont, and increased contribution from Buckner, which was acquired in August 2021 as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses, most notably at our construction service businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $506 million for the year compared to $403 million last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results across several businesses as well as the contribution of Metromont. EBITDA for 2022 was impacted by increased costs of material and labor across many of our businesses, which reflect the impact of broader economic conditions, including the impact of inflation on our operations during the year. Looking next at our consolidated results for 2022. Our effective tax rate was 32%. However, this is not indicative of our ongoing effective tax rate, rather, it\u2019s a result of having a few immaterial items that combined for a net tax benefit that is being magnified by our small pretax loss for the year. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $250 million in 2022 compared to net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion in 2021, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $2.1 billion in 2021, driven by changes in both, the fixed maturity and public equity valuations. It\u2019s worth highlighting, once again, that given the magnitude of our equity portfolio, we believe generally accepted accounting principles, which require that we include unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and net income, creates volatility in revenues and net income that can obscure the strong operating performance of our businesses. Finally, I\u2019ll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion in 2022 compared to $2.3 billion in 2021. Operating cash flows in 2022 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines but most significantly within our underwriting operations given the strong premium volume in recent periods. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $13.1 billion at the end of the year compared to $14.7 billion at the end of 2021. Again, this decline is driven by declines in both, fixed maturity and public equity investments, as I previously discussed. During 2022, we repurchased 233,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program versus 153,000 shares last year. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to be with you this morning to recap our 2022 insurance engine results. In short, we had a tremendous year, premium production in our underwriting divisions totaling just under $10 billion for the year and total revenues within the insurance engine eclipsing $8 billion. Although our combined ratio of 92% is slightly higher than our goal at the start of the year, overall, I am very pleased given the events and the economic uncertainties that played out over the course of the last year and continue today. Now, I\u2019ll discuss our full year results across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, State National program services operations and Nephila insurance-linked securities operations. Looking first at our Insurance segment. Within our insurance operations, we produced a combined ratio of a 92%, while growing gross written premiums by 19%. Growth in premium production has remained strong in the fourth quarter and we continue to take advantage of new business opportunities in the specialty insurance marketplace as well as maintaining strong premium retention levels and capturing rate. We set out at the beginning of 2021 with our 10-5-1 goal within our global insurance underwriting operations to deliver $10 billion in annual gross written premiums in five years, targeting $1 billion in annual underwriting profits, or simplistically speaking, achieving a 90% or better combined ratio. We are well on our way. From a production standpoint, we have capitalized on strong market conditions to significantly grow our premium base in our preferred product classes. While our 2022 combined ratio was slightly above our target, the primary reason for this was related to prior accident year loss development from the softer years of the last insurance cycle. Despite these trends, we were able to produce just under $550 million of underwriting profits within our global insurance underwriting operations for 2022. And while this was an outstanding result, we are not planning to rest on these achievements. Our insurance leadership teams remain focused on profitable growth strategies and obtaining adequate pricing for our products in order to continue to deliver our market-leading capabilities and products to our clients. This disciplined approach is key to achieving our production and profitability goals in 2023 and beyond. Our underwriting profitability in 2022 benefited from our efforts to reduce volatility. 2022 will be one of the costliest years on record for natural catastrophe losses in addition to exposures we faced from the war in Ukraine, which once again validates our efforts in recent years to reduce our exposure to property catastrophe risk. Additionally, in 2022, we lowered our expense ratio by 2 more points, thanks to ongoing productivity efforts and leveraging the increased scale of our operations. That all being said, we saw a lower benefit from favorable development on prior year\u2019s loss reserves in 2022 compared to a year ago, particularly over the second half of the year. This was most notable within certain subclasses of our longer tail professional liability and general liability lines, where we have recognized adverse development past few quarters. Over the course of 2022, we faced significant headwinds in the form of economic and social inflation, and it became more evident that our claims trend patterns were impacted by delays in the reopening of the U.S. court system following the COVID pandemic. In reaction to these trends during the fourth quarter, we undertook a detailed actuarial and claims review around our brokerage contractors book within our general liability product line and our risk-managed E&O and D&O books in the U.S. within our professional liability product line. We\u2019ve seen an increase in claims frequency and severity in these books in recent quarters, in particular across the 2016 to 2019 accident years, the incidence of claims being reported exceeding our expectations. Additionally, in the case of our risk-managed professional liability lines, where we deploy larger-than-average limits, we have experienced a higher-than-expected number of losses piercing through our attachment points, coupled with increased loss severity on these claims. Our professional and general liability product lines are being adversely impacted by the heightened levels of inflation currently being experienced, including increased social inflation. Litigation and defense costs are increasing as are the cost of settlements and jury awards. Further, as has been broadly reported, the delay in course reopening post the pandemic has introduced a change in development patterns, which are now becoming more fully understood. It is worth noting that most of the increase to reserves in the fourth quarter is sitting in IBNR. As we have discussed in earlier quarters, we continue to update and incorporate assumptions around inflation into our pricing, loss reserving and underwriting. We remain cautious given some of the uncertainty that exists around our longer tail product lines as these books of business take years to develop. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we\u2019re responding quickly to increased loss reserves following the indications of increased claim frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. I would also highlight that the increased reserves and claims reporting patterns in question were predominantly associated with the tail end of the last soft market. Since 2019, we\u2019ve experienced material rate increases, seen a tightening in terms and conditions; optimized our portfolios through underwriting action and risk selection; adjusted attachment points; managed limits and diversified our portfolios. While we are seeing size of these underwriting actions producing more positive loss experience, coupled with a decline in the number of security class action filings in recent years, we remain cautious in recognizing those benefits considering the uncertainties around the longer-term impacts of inflation. Overall, we feel we are very well positioned heading into 2023. Despite the challenging economic environment, we are pleased with our overall results for the past two years and remain focused on delivering consistent top financial performance to contribute to the growth and the value of the overall Markel Corporation. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. We showed significant improvement this year, producing a 92% combined for the year compared to 105% a year ago. Our reinsurance team has done a fantastic job of re-underwriting our book and reducing volatility over the last few years, to focus on long-term profitability within our core casualty, professional and specialty product lines. We\u2019re starting to see more of the better priced business earned through the results. Gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment were only down 1% for the year, demonstrating our ability to remix the portfolio away from property, which we serve through Nephila and growing our preferred lines. Ultimately, we\u2019re not focused on growth for the sake of growth within our reinsurance operations, but rather our energy is aimed at being a profitable, durable reinsurer that is relevant to the clients we support. Next, I\u2019ll touch on program services and fronting operations, and our insurance-linked securities operations, both of which are recorded as part of our other operations. Our State National program services and Nephila ILS teams continue to remain focused on capturing market opportunities and partnering with our underwriting divisions to take advantage of synergies available within our multifaceted insurance platform. As a reminder, almost all of our gross written premium within our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $3.4 billion for the year versus $3 billion a year ago. Premium growth was due to both expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. It was also due to growing within our other fronting operations generated from the transition of our Global Reinsurance division\u2019s property business to Nephila and opportunities we see in the property cat space more broadly. Fee revenues were up 19% from a year ago, and the operations continued to produce strong operating margins. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market. In our Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the year were down due to the impact of selling our Velocity and Volante MGA operations in 2022. The net loss from operations in our ILS unit was driven largely by the costs incurred at Volante from launching a Lloyd\u2019s syndicate prior to disposition. A highlight this year from our ILS operations was our successful execution of the sale of Nephila\u2019s two MGA entities during the year, realizing gains of totaling $226 million and unlocking significant value created since our acquisition of Nephila in 2018. Assets under management in Nephila were $7.2 billion at the end of 2022. As we have previously discussed, the past several years of cat activity have been particularly difficult on both Nephila and the ILS market as a whole. The multiple years of event losses, coupled with recent volatility in the capital markets have impacted investor decisions to allocate capital to ILS, reducing our level of assets under management. Additionally, increases in the cost of capital during 2022, driven by a higher interest rate environment, further impacted the estimated fair value of our fund management operations. The combination of these factors ultimately resulted in a partial impairment of goodwill attributed to our fund management operations in the fourth quarter of $8 million. We remain confident that Nephila will produce more favorable results over the long term. Pricing in the property catastrophe market is strong and Nephila achieved significant rate increases at the 1/1 renewals and expects to continue to capitalize on improving pricing as the year progresses, which will lead to an improved outlook for investor returns. Our team in Nephila continues to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital to address the evolving areas of risk management needs, including the expansion of our climate and specialty product offerings. We also continue to look for opportunities to achieve synergies amongst our various insurance platforms, underwriting program services and ILS to provide customized insurance solutions, best matching capital risk to meet the needs of our customers. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities remained strong in the fourth quarter end at 1/1. Despite ongoing concerns around the economic slowdown and the broader macroeconomic backdrop, there\u2019s a strong need for insurance protection and risk management solutions across the wide array of products we offer. During the fourth quarter, we saw rate increases moderate in pockets of our broad portfolio. For example, financial institutions and large account risk managed excess casualty. We also experienced modest rate decreases in our public D&O portfolio. However, most lines maintained the level of increase experienced over the year. And within our property lines, as you might suspect, rates have begun to increase meaningfully given the recent loss activity, a supply-demand mismatch and higher reinsurance costs. As we\u2019ve been assessing in recent quarters, we have entered a more nuanced space of a broader insurance market cycle where different product lines have different patterns, and we continue to face uncertainty pertaining to inflation in all its forms. As such, we remain laser-focused on rate adequacy in each account that we write, looking at -- to our underwriter stack with discipline. Fortunately, there are a number of opportunities to grow profitably given our broad product range capabilities, global footprint, exceptional talent and strong trading relationships across multiple distribution channels. Therefore, it\u2019s incumbent upon us to be discerning and only write business that meets our profitability targets. With regards to our outward ceded reinsurance placements, we anticipated a challenging environment that was experienced in the fourth quarter ended 1/1. Our team did an exceptional job putting together our placements. We avoided any surprises and importantly any delays in placement or gaps in our programs. Coverage, attachment and pricing were all within expectations, despite some changes year-over-year. We\u2019re well positioned to pass costs along and don\u2019t anticipate any meaningful changes to our margins or underlying underwriting strategies. In summary, I feel good about how we are positioned heading into 2023. We\u2019ll continue to focus on the things we can control, and be aware of and react to the things we cannot. I want to take a moment to thank my 5,000 colleagues across our insurance businesses. Without their efforts and passion to serve our customers, these results would not be possible. Because of them, it is a joy for me to come and to work. Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn things back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. As Brian reported earlier, reported revenues of $4.8 billion at Markel Ventures, up from $3.6 billion a year ago, and EBITDA reached a new record of $506 million, up from $403 million. I am delighted with the accomplishments of the team at Markel Ventures, and I hope you are as well. Between the ongoing pressures and strains of supply chain issues, tight labor markets, inflation and every other sort of challenge you can imagine, the people of Markel Ventures continue to serve their customers and each other and produce excellent financial results. We continue to diligently search for additional opportunities to grow by acquisition at Markel Ventures, but we did not add any new platform companies in 2022. I hope you see this as an example of the discipline with which we allocate capital. The rise in interest rates and the disruption in the equity and fixed income markets has caused the number of inbound calls we\u2019re receiving to start to go up as 2022 progressed, and I\u2019m hopeful that we will find attractive opportunities in 2023 and beyond. Rest assured, we will remain disciplined as we see new opportunities and only deploy capital when we expect to earn attractive returns doing so. Our array of businesses at Markel Ventures gives us interesting insights and observation points about general economic conditions. Supply chain and inflation issues remain, and they continue to present challenges. I hope you share my sense that the results of 2022 provide yet another year of evidence that we have a talented team on the field and that they will continue to operate the businesses of Markel Ventures with excellence. In our investment operations, you can see the effects of higher interest rates and lower equity prices and the results that Brian reported to you a few minutes ago. I\u2019m very optimistic about our circumstances now. First, our recurring investment income continues to rise at a meaningful pace. Each day, when we invest the cash flows from our operations, we\u2019re getting higher interest income than what is currently on our books. We also enjoy a position of capital strength such that we are regularly and systematically adding to our equity portfolio at more and more attractive prices. We also continue to repurchase Markel shares during the year at what we believe to be attractive prices. While we reported declines in the mark-to-market prices of our equity and fixed income holdings, due to the increase in interest rates and equity market declines, we did outperform the relevant indices. The long-term returns produced by our long-standing investment discipline remain outstanding, and I\u2019m optimistic that will continue to be the case. Interest income and dividend income, specifically, rose 22% in 2022 from the combination of higher earning fixed income securities, higher dividend payments and steady investment of our cash flows into additional equity and fixed income holdings. In fact, our repurchases of 233,000 shares, up from 166,000 last year and our purchases of equity securities were almost completely funded by these recurring cash flow streams. Those factors bode well for future results. Our three engines of insurance, ventures and investments provide diversification and resilience to Markel. We prepare -- we are prepared to operate in whatever environment we encounter and to continue to make forward progress over long periods of time as we do so. We thank you for your commitment as long-term shareholders. We look forward to seeing you at our annual meeting in May -- May 17th, and we now welcome your questions. If you could open the floor for questions, please?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go first to Mark Hughes at Truist.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. You suggested in the insurance business, most lines have maintained the pricing level that you\u2019d seen for most of the year. Could you maybe provide some specific, where do you see pricing, and how does that compare to loss cost increases?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Sure, Mark, it\u2019s Jeremy. So, a few comments on that maybe to build off what I shared. So, I would say that in the fourth quarter across the total portfolio, the level of rate increases would have slightly dipped below the level of the trend that we\u2019re applying. So that was a development. But driven by some of the lines that I called out specifically, like public D&O, like financial institutions, like risk-managed excess casualty, those sorts of lines. Many of the trends that have been talked about, say, for example, workers\u2019 compensation, have been pretty consistent with regards to sort of modest levels of sort of price decreases. And many other areas of the portfolio have broadly held on to the rate, property and certainly one that\u2019s been improving. So, we\u2019re starting to see different cycles and patterns, if you will, across each of our products. And while I think that is an interesting unfoldment of point to look at level of rate increases and to look at sort of how we\u2019re thinking about trend in those product lines, I think what we are most focused on within each of our product lines is where we are with regards to rate adequacy. And that\u2019s sort of what we incorporate into our thinking with regards to how we come into 2023 and operate throughout this year. And we\u2019ll see. I mean, I think with regards to take casualty, more broadly speaking, I think that\u2019s one for the industry to watch very carefully. I think we should be very sensitive to what\u2019s happening with regards to rate and trend in that space.\nMark Hughes: When you say dip below the trend that you\u2019re applying, the inflation trend, is that what you\u2019re saying that pricing is below loss cost trend?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Yes, exactly. So level of rate increase relative to loss cost trend.\nMark Hughes: Okay.\nJeremy Noble: And those two things were moving the opposite direction. Over the course of 2022 loss cost trends, we were incorporating were increasing over the course of 2020, broadly speaking, and again, we write over 100 major product lines. The levels of rate increases were declining a little bit.\nMark Hughes: And then, the adverse you saw in 2015 through 2019, do you think -- I assume that\u2019s a broader issue. You seem to be maybe a little more at the forefront in recognizing that. Do you think others will follow suit? What\u2019s your sense on how you sit compared to your peers?\nJeremy Noble: Well, I can\u2019t possibly comment on what others may see. And what I would say for us -- two stories, right? So, if we take general liability with NGL, we had a specific look at our brokerage contractors primary casualty book. Last few quarters, we were seeing actual claims experience exceed what we expected in our models, and we\u2019ve been reacting along the way. And we decided to take a deeper look in the fourth quarter given there seems to be that trend emerging. Our main takeaway is that the ultimate claims reporting pattern may be a little bit longer than we initially anticipated. I think -- some of those causes can be the growth in the book that we experienced over the past 10 years. There\u2019s some larger project work in that book. And ultimately, that may take longer to settle. And then there\u2019s no doubt that the court closures with the pandemic length in the tail. Those factors get exacerbated by the unfavorable legal environment that we face and a rising cost of inflation. And that is not going to be unique to us, but I can\u2019t speak to what others are sort of doing in that space. We were very cautious. We put up additional IBNR across those maturing accident years. We\u2019ll see how things play out over time. In Professional, we\u2019re speaking to our large risk-managed E&O and D&O accounts in the U.S. where we offer larger limits. We tend to play in an excess position in the years in question. We would often be in high access positions. What we\u2019ve begun to have some concern around is an emergence of a pattern where it may be more likely that our layers get implicated than we previously anticipated. And we\u2019re seeing some of that already. We\u2019ve seen that in recent quarters. The good news is, right, in that quote, there\u2019s not much of a claim reporting tale. We\u2019re talking a claims-made book of business. It\u2019s a finite claims universe. And so, we got our underwriting claims and actuarial teams together in the fourth quarter, took a deep dive, ultimately concluded that we would take a more pessimistic view with regards to how many claims we could be exposed to. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind the rising costs to defend, increasing settlement amounts are linked with a more inflationary environment we\u2019re experiencing, and that\u2019s the impetus for our development. Again, that isn\u2019t going to be unique to us, but I can\u2019t speak to how others are handling that. The years in question as well on the professional side, they correspond at the peak years for security class action filings, lower court dismissals and now that\u2019s kind of playing out. Importantly, I think across our books of business, those were experiencing on the tail end of the last soft insurance market cycle. Since then, we\u2019ve had the better part of four years of rate increases, and we\u2019ve done a lot on the underwriting side, terms, conditions, limits profiles, attachments. We\u2019ve seen retentions increase from clients. So, we\u2019ve taken a lot of underwriting action and now we\u2019ll just take a very sort of cautious view on the most recent years, and we\u2019ll see how that plays out. As you know us, we react to bad news very quickly, and we\u2019re pretty cautious with regards to the economic backdrop at the moment.\nMark Hughes: Yes, sure. But on the reinsurance side, what\u2019s your appetite to grow as you see pricing here in your target line?\nJeremy Noble: Well, I think that\u2019s the part. It\u2019s a little bit down to the appetite. So, we certainly have the ability to grow and the capital to deploy supporting growth if we\u2019re happy with the pricing and the terms and condition and the environment. I mean it is the case that while property got a lot of the headlines around 1/1, casualty, professional specialty lines where we play, definitely were firmer acting as a more disciplined market and we will see improvements with regards to coverage attachment and pricing in our portfolio as we move this year. We will opportunistically take advantage where it makes sense in that space.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move next to Scott Heleniak at RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Good morning. I just had a few quick ones here. I wanted to ask about the other services unit that had higher revenues than normal. And I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything related to ILS or performance fees or anything in there. So, it was higher revenue and then higher operating income. Just trying to kind of break down what\u2019s going on there, just to look at what\u2019s -- any kind of unusual or non-recurring type items to get kind of a run rate there, if you have any additional color on that?\nBrian Costanzo: Sure. And there\u2019s tables that will sort of break some of that detail out, Scott. So I mean, the -- I probably touched on some of the more unusual one-off nonrecurring items, like gains from the disposition of businesses or like -- moves. On the core operating earnings, driven more by our State National program services side and that\u2019s linked to just the profitability of that business. On the fund management side, I commented on sort of expenses -- revenue trends with regards to the sale of MGAs being in the period last year versus this year. Broadly speaking, our fund management operations are slightly profitable on the cat side -- property cat side, offset by being slightly unprofitable where we\u2019re investing in sort of the climate and specialty space. But most of what you\u2019re seeing in that space is coming through the strong performance on our program services side.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. And then the -- you mentioned the property rate increases, which is everyone\u2019s been talking about that that\u2019s improving. So, I know on the reinsurance side, but on the insurance side, is that something you\u2019re going to have a significant appetite to start ramping up? How are you feeling about the property side of it, given where pricing is now?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. We worked really hard in the last few years to reduce -- so property has multiple stories to it, right? I mean there\u2019s obviously the catastrophe side and sort of the non-catastrophe side. We worked really hard over the last few years to manage our total aggregate exposure to natural catastrophes, our PMLs in that space. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to change or revisit that position to any great extent. But we do play in that space. We do have a meaningful property portfolio. We will benefit from the rate increases in our property portfolio, where we deploy capacity without a doubt. We can see and strategically grow in that area a little bit. And I think we\u2019ll also benefit from even on the attritional side, it\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the rate increases. So, we\u2019re really focused on sort of managing our aggregate exposure. We\u2019ll opportunistically use this as a time to optimize our portfolio. I would not anticipate or expect any significant change in our underlying strategy with regards to property.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That\u2019s what I figured, but I also figured I\u2019d ask. The other question is switching gears a little bit, just on the venture side, pretty strong quarter in terms of revenue and bottom line. Any areas of strength you can call? I think you had mentioned construction in there, but anything else you can call out? And then, also in terms of just -- it seemed like the profitability was much better than it had been in the past few quarters, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything that drove that just kind of rate increases and maybe cost manager or anything else that\u2019s kind of played out there?\nTom Gayner: Well, what I would call out is try to get a restaurant reservation, try to get a flight, try to get a hotel room, try to buy a car. And the economy is doing pretty well. The demand is out there. And I just think our managers do a very good job of running their businesses. And fortunately, no, it\u2019s not some cost-cutting program or regime or big layoffs or anything like that. We don\u2019t have that going on. We have people who run their businesses every day, and they\u2019re pretty good at it.\nScott Heleniak: Just one last one, too, just on the expense ratio. You made significant improvement in 2022. And should you think we should expect any further improvement on that, or is it -- do you think it\u2019s sort of leveled out there? I know a lot of that is driven by premium leverage.\nBrian Costanzo: Yes, you nailed it right there at the end, Scott. You\u2019ll have to see and observe it as we go through the year, it will depend on sort of the trend, I think, with regards to net earned premium, which will follow the trend with regards to how we see gross written premium play out. And a lot of that story for 2023 is going to be looking at kind of the pricing environment and the trend that we were talking about before. So, we are really pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve been making in the expense ratio, focused on productivity and the ability to scale off our expense base as we\u2019ve grown. I think we can continue to do that. I don\u2019t know it will be at the rate that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll take a follow-up from Mark Hughes at Truist.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. I wonder, any thoughts on the 2020 and 2021 accident years, how those -- have those been subject to the same forces? I know the initial frequency and severity was low as a result of COVID, or I assume you would see it that way? I\u2019m just sort of curious whether they are also developing adversely maybe from a much better position to start with.\nBrian Costanzo: A couple of things I\u2019d point to, Mark. So, when you start talking about in the longer tail lines, accident years like 2020 and 2021, and then clearly, the current one with regards to \u201822, right? It takes a while to see an emergence of claims activity. So, we\u2019re not kind of at that sort of seasoning yet. So, we\u2019re not seeing unexpected claims activity. Additionally, as I mentioned before, the improvement in the broader sort of specialty insurance marketplace, with regards to pricing, terms and conditions, underwriting actions, right, that\u2019s a contrast with the hardening and the improvement in the insurance market that started to take place in 2019 and carried through 2022. So, that creates, I think, a different dynamic on the more recent years in the past year. What I would suggest, and even sort of what we talked about this year with regards to the current accident year loss ratio, we\u2019re taking a very cautious view, right, given the sort of the economic backdrop. We\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s unexpected or unpleasant on the most recent years.\nMark Hughes: Understood. And then what was the impact of your Hagerty investment on the P&L in the quarter?\nTom Gayner: Not very much.\nMark Hughes: Okay. Your total equities at the end of the quarter was at $4.6 billion?\nTom Gayner: No, that\u2019s cumulative unrealized gain. Yes. That\u2019s what we bought -- $4.6 billion more than we paid for it.\nMark Hughes: Yes, yes. What was the total balance on your equities at the end of the quarter?\nTom Gayner: Looks like 7.6 publicly traded equities.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to hearing from you on the next call and seeing you in Richmond at our annual meeting on May 17th. Thank you so much. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. As Brian-Doyle Murray said in Groundhog Day, \u201crise and shine, campers, don't forget your booties because it's coooold outside.\u201d Happy Groundhog Day from Richmond, Virginia, where we're getting our first snow of the season, doesn't happen very often around here. So, I just couldn't let the occasion pass without saying something. This is Tom Gayner, not Brian-Doyle Murray. I'm your CEO, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to the Markel Corporation year-end conference call. I'm joined today by Brian Costanzo, our Chief Accounting Officer; and Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance operations. On today's call, Brian will give you a rundown on the financial results we just reported and Jeremy will follow with some comments on our insurance operations. I'll come back after them with a few thoughts about our ventures and investment operations, and then we will open the floor for any questions you might have. As a public company, the cadence of these calls is every 90 days. Each quarter, we share our financial results with you as we hold this call. While we update you one quarter at a time, let me assure you that is not the cadence we follow in managing Markel. Our North Star remains the dual time horizon of forever and right now. We believe that the combination of the long-term time horizon embodied by the concept of forever, coupled with the discipline and urgency of the right now provides a balance that serves us well. Quarters are like the rings inside the trunk of a mighty sequoia tree that give you a useful piece of information about one small chapter in the life of the tree, but any given ring is just one in a sequence of many. Given our long-term focus, one of the ways we monitor our results is to look at some key numbers in five-year buckets. We use five-year increments to gain perspective. We also tie our incentive compensation calculations for executive management to five-year results to demonstrate our commitment to long-term performance. For your consideration, here are some of the five-year numbers for the year that just ended: One, from 2018 to 2022, we reported total revenues of just over $50 billion, up from $26.5 billion in the previous five-year period. That's an increase of roughly 90%. Two, we reported earned premiums from our insurance operations of $29.5 billion, up from $19 billion. That's an increase of 55%. Three, we reported underwriting profits of $1.8 billion, up from $821 million. That's an increase of 116%. Four, we reported ILS and program services revenues of $1.7 billion, up from $44 million. That's an increase of 3,763.64%, and I wouldn't extrapolate that particular number if I were in your shoes. Five, we reported Markel Ventures revenues of just over $15 billion, up from just over $5 billion. That's an increase of 200%. Sixth, we reported Markel Ventures EBITDA of $1.7 billion, up from $600 million. That's an increase of 183%. Seven, we reported net investment income of $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion. That's an increase of about 18%. Eight, we reported comprehensive income of $3.7 billion, up from $3.5 billion. That's an increase of 6%. And finally, nine, the price per share ended at $1,317 up from $1,139 five years ago. That's an increase of about 15%. I hope you would share my sense of forward progress at Markel of meaningful amounts measured in meaningful amounts of time. We're excited and pleased with most, but not all of those numbers, and we're optimistic that as we grew the next five-year batch, we'll be pleased with each line of that report. In the next five years, if we make the same sort of progress on the first eight items on the list, I'll be surprised if the ninth line doesn't follow. With that update and comment on the five-year numbers, I'll turn it over to Brian for his comments on the 2022 results. Thank you, Jeremy. As Brian reported earlier, reported revenues of $4.8 billion at Markel Ventures, up from $3.6 billion a year ago, and EBITDA reached a new record of $506 million, up from $403 million. I am delighted with the accomplishments of the team at Markel Ventures, and I hope you are as well. Between the ongoing pressures and strains of supply chain issues, tight labor markets, inflation and every other sort of challenge you can imagine, the people of Markel Ventures continue to serve their customers and each other and produce excellent financial results. We continue to diligently search for additional opportunities to grow by acquisition at Markel Ventures, but we did not add any new platform companies in 2022. I hope you see this as an example of the discipline with which we allocate capital. The rise in interest rates and the disruption in the equity and fixed income markets has caused the number of inbound calls we're receiving to start to go up as 2022 progressed, and I'm hopeful that we will find attractive opportunities in 2023 and beyond. Rest assured, we will remain disciplined as we see new opportunities and only deploy capital when we expect to earn attractive returns doing so. Our array of businesses at Markel Ventures gives us interesting insights and observation points about general economic conditions. Supply chain and inflation issues remain, and they continue to present challenges. I hope you share my sense that the results of 2022 provide yet another year of evidence that we have a talented team on the field and that they will continue to operate the businesses of Markel Ventures with excellence. In our investment operations, you can see the effects of higher interest rates and lower equity prices and the results that Brian reported to you a few minutes ago. I'm very optimistic about our circumstances now. First, our recurring investment income continues to rise at a meaningful pace. Each day, when we invest the cash flows from our operations, we're getting higher interest income than what is currently on our books. We also enjoy a position of capital strength such that we are regularly and systematically adding to our equity portfolio at more and more attractive prices. We also continue to repurchase Markel shares during the year at what we believe to be attractive prices. While we reported declines in the mark-to-market prices of our equity and fixed income holdings, due to the increase in interest rates and equity market declines, we did outperform the relevant indices. The long-term returns produced by our long-standing investment discipline remain outstanding, and I'm optimistic that will continue to be the case. Interest income and dividend income, specifically, rose 22% in 2022 from the combination of higher earning fixed income securities, higher dividend payments and steady investment of our cash flows into additional equity and fixed income holdings. In fact, our repurchases of 233,000 shares, up from 166,000 last year and our purchases of equity securities were almost completely funded by these recurring cash flow streams. Those factors bode well for future results. Our three engines of insurance, ventures and investments provide diversification and resilience to Markel. We prepare -- we are prepared to operate in whatever environment we encounter and to continue to make forward progress over long periods of time as we do so. We thank you for your commitment as long-term shareholders. We look forward to seeing you at our annual meeting in May -- May 17th, and we now welcome your questions. If you could open the floor for questions, please? Well, what I would call out is try to get a restaurant reservation, try to get a flight, try to get a hotel room, try to buy a car. And the economy is doing pretty well. The demand is out there. And I just think our managers do a very good job of running their businesses. And fortunately, no, it's not some cost-cutting program or regime or big layoffs or anything like that. We don't have that going on. We have people who run their businesses every day, and they're pretty good at it. Not very much. No, that's cumulative unrealized gain. Yes. That's what we bought -- $4.6 billion more than we paid for it. Looks like 7.6 publicly traded equities. Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to hearing from you on the next call and seeing you in Richmond at our annual meeting on May 17th. Thank you so much. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Brian Costanzo",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be with you all this morning to report the numbers from our 2022 results. Our insurance and Markel Ventures operations delivered strong operating results while navigating a complex macroeconomic environment, and we're pleased with the steady growth we're seeing in the investment income generated on the investment portfolio. While the volatility in the equity and bond markets created unrealized losses in the portfolio this year, we remain focused on long-term investment performance, which better reflects the quality and durability of our investment portfolio. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums surpassed $9.8 billion for the year compared to $8.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 16%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, strong policy retention levels, continued increases in rates and expanded product offerings. Our professional liability and general liability product lines continue to lead the way, but we've also achieved meaningful growth across many of our other product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio was 92% in 2022, which included $46 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian and $36 million of net losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict for a combined 1 point impact to the combined ratio. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our initial estimate for losses attributed to Hurricane Ian by $24 million. Our estimate for net losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognized in the first quarter and remain unchanged throughout the year. In 2021, our consolidated combined ratio was 90%, which included $195 million or 3 points of losses on natural catastrophes. Excluding these event losses from both years, our consolidated combined ratio in 2022 was 91% compared to an 87% for 2021. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $167 million in 2022 compared to $480 million in 2021. In 2022, we experienced adverse development on certain of our general liability and professional liability product lines within our insurance segment in the 2016 through 2019 accident years, primarily arising from unfavorable claim settlements and increased claim frequency and severity trends. As discussed in the third quarter, the impacts of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims, particularly on our longer tail product lines. And as a result, we are approaching reductions to prior year loss reserves cautiously, particularly on more recent accident years. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increased loss reserves following indications of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our expectations. Whereas in instances where claim trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we are often waiting to reduce our loss reserves, and we'll evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. Turning next to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income were $1.6 billion in 2022 and were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the year. This compares to net investment gains of $2 billion in 2021 attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, and we continue to maintain our investing discipline, understanding that periodic declines in the equity markets are to be expected and will result in variability in the timing of investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of December, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $4.6 billion. With regards to net investment income, we reported $447 million in 2022 compared to $367 million in 2021. It's worth noting that these amounts are now comprised entirely of our recurring interest and dividend income from the investment portfolio. Previously, net investment income also included the income or loss recognized on our equity method investments, which are managed separately from the rest of the investment portfolio, the results from which are now included in other revenues. The increase in net investment income in 2022 reflects the benefit of higher interest rates on our short-term investments and cash equivalents during the last half of the year as yields on these investments have increased sharply from nearly 0% a year ago. We are also beginning to see the benefit of higher interest rates within our fixed maturity portfolio through recent purchases at higher yield rates. That impact will become more meaningful in future periods as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases of fixed maturity securities began to exceed the average book yield on the portfolio. Net unrealized investment losses included in our comprehensive income in 2022 totaled $1.1 billion net of taxes, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. As a reminder, we typically hold our fixed maturity securities until maturity, and we generally expect unrealized losses or gains to reverse in future periods as the bonds mature. Our portfolio has an average rating of AAA, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 31% to $4.8 billion in 2022 compared to $3.6 billion last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont, and increased contribution from Buckner, which was acquired in August 2021 as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses, most notably at our construction service businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures was $506 million for the year compared to $403 million last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results across several businesses as well as the contribution of Metromont. EBITDA for 2022 was impacted by increased costs of material and labor across many of our businesses, which reflect the impact of broader economic conditions, including the impact of inflation on our operations during the year. Looking next at our consolidated results for 2022. Our effective tax rate was 32%. However, this is not indicative of our ongoing effective tax rate, rather, it's a result of having a few immaterial items that combined for a net tax benefit that is being magnified by our small pretax loss for the year. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $250 million in 2022 compared to net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion in 2021, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $2.1 billion in 2021, driven by changes in both, the fixed maturity and public equity valuations. It's worth highlighting, once again, that given the magnitude of our equity portfolio, we believe generally accepted accounting principles, which require that we include unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and net income, creates volatility in revenues and net income that can obscure the strong operating performance of our businesses. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.7 billion in 2022 compared to $2.3 billion in 2021. Operating cash flows in 2022 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines but most significantly within our underwriting operations given the strong premium volume in recent periods. Total shareholders' equity stood at $13.1 billion at the end of the year compared to $14.7 billion at the end of 2021. Again, this decline is driven by declines in both, fixed maturity and public equity investments, as I previously discussed. During 2022, we repurchased 233,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program versus 153,000 shares last year. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance businesses. Sure. And there's tables that will sort of break some of that detail out, Scott. So I mean, the -- I probably touched on some of the more unusual one-off nonrecurring items, like gains from the disposition of businesses or like -- moves. On the core operating earnings, driven more by our State National program services side and that's linked to just the profitability of that business. On the fund management side, I commented on sort of expenses -- revenue trends with regards to the sale of MGAs being in the period last year versus this year. Broadly speaking, our fund management operations are slightly profitable on the cat side -- property cat side, offset by being slightly unprofitable where we're investing in sort of the climate and specialty space. But most of what you're seeing in that space is coming through the strong performance on our program services side. Yes, you nailed it right there at the end, Scott. You'll have to see and observe it as we go through the year, it will depend on sort of the trend, I think, with regards to net earned premium, which will follow the trend with regards to how we see gross written premium play out. And a lot of that story for 2023 is going to be looking at kind of the pricing environment and the trend that we were talking about before. So, we are really pleased with the progress that we've been making in the expense ratio, focused on productivity and the ability to scale off our expense base as we've grown. I think we can continue to do that. I don't know it will be at the rate that we've seen in the last couple of years. A couple of things I'd point to, Mark. So, when you start talking about in the longer tail lines, accident years like 2020 and 2021, and then clearly, the current one with regards to \u201822, right? It takes a while to see an emergence of claims activity. So, we're not kind of at that sort of seasoning yet. So, we're not seeing unexpected claims activity. Additionally, as I mentioned before, the improvement in the broader sort of specialty insurance marketplace, with regards to pricing, terms and conditions, underwriting actions, right, that's a contrast with the hardening and the improvement in the insurance market that started to take place in 2019 and carried through 2022. So, that creates, I think, a different dynamic on the more recent years in the past year. What I would suggest, and even sort of what we talked about this year with regards to the current accident year loss ratio, we're taking a very cautious view, right, given the sort of the economic backdrop. We're not seeing anything that's unexpected or unpleasant on the most recent years."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you this morning to recap our 2022 insurance engine results. In short, we had a tremendous year, premium production in our underwriting divisions totaling just under $10 billion for the year and total revenues within the insurance engine eclipsing $8 billion. Although our combined ratio of 92% is slightly higher than our goal at the start of the year, overall, I am very pleased given the events and the economic uncertainties that played out over the course of the last year and continue today. Now, I'll discuss our full year results across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, State National program services operations and Nephila insurance-linked securities operations. Looking first at our Insurance segment. Within our insurance operations, we produced a combined ratio of a 92%, while growing gross written premiums by 19%. Growth in premium production has remained strong in the fourth quarter and we continue to take advantage of new business opportunities in the specialty insurance marketplace as well as maintaining strong premium retention levels and capturing rate. We set out at the beginning of 2021 with our 10-5-1 goal within our global insurance underwriting operations to deliver $10 billion in annual gross written premiums in five years, targeting $1 billion in annual underwriting profits, or simplistically speaking, achieving a 90% or better combined ratio. We are well on our way. From a production standpoint, we have capitalized on strong market conditions to significantly grow our premium base in our preferred product classes. While our 2022 combined ratio was slightly above our target, the primary reason for this was related to prior accident year loss development from the softer years of the last insurance cycle. Despite these trends, we were able to produce just under $550 million of underwriting profits within our global insurance underwriting operations for 2022. And while this was an outstanding result, we are not planning to rest on these achievements. Our insurance leadership teams remain focused on profitable growth strategies and obtaining adequate pricing for our products in order to continue to deliver our market-leading capabilities and products to our clients. This disciplined approach is key to achieving our production and profitability goals in 2023 and beyond. Our underwriting profitability in 2022 benefited from our efforts to reduce volatility. 2022 will be one of the costliest years on record for natural catastrophe losses in addition to exposures we faced from the war in Ukraine, which once again validates our efforts in recent years to reduce our exposure to property catastrophe risk. Additionally, in 2022, we lowered our expense ratio by 2 more points, thanks to ongoing productivity efforts and leveraging the increased scale of our operations. That all being said, we saw a lower benefit from favorable development on prior year's loss reserves in 2022 compared to a year ago, particularly over the second half of the year. This was most notable within certain subclasses of our longer tail professional liability and general liability lines, where we have recognized adverse development past few quarters. Over the course of 2022, we faced significant headwinds in the form of economic and social inflation, and it became more evident that our claims trend patterns were impacted by delays in the reopening of the U.S. court system following the COVID pandemic. In reaction to these trends during the fourth quarter, we undertook a detailed actuarial and claims review around our brokerage contractors book within our general liability product line and our risk-managed E&O and D&O books in the U.S. within our professional liability product line. We've seen an increase in claims frequency and severity in these books in recent quarters, in particular across the 2016 to 2019 accident years, the incidence of claims being reported exceeding our expectations. Additionally, in the case of our risk-managed professional liability lines, where we deploy larger-than-average limits, we have experienced a higher-than-expected number of losses piercing through our attachment points, coupled with increased loss severity on these claims. Our professional and general liability product lines are being adversely impacted by the heightened levels of inflation currently being experienced, including increased social inflation. Litigation and defense costs are increasing as are the cost of settlements and jury awards. Further, as has been broadly reported, the delay in course reopening post the pandemic has introduced a change in development patterns, which are now becoming more fully understood. It is worth noting that most of the increase to reserves in the fourth quarter is sitting in IBNR. As we have discussed in earlier quarters, we continue to update and incorporate assumptions around inflation into our pricing, loss reserving and underwriting. We remain cautious given some of the uncertainty that exists around our longer tail product lines as these books of business take years to develop. Consistent with our reserving philosophy, we're responding quickly to increased loss reserves following the indications of increased claim frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. I would also highlight that the increased reserves and claims reporting patterns in question were predominantly associated with the tail end of the last soft market. Since 2019, we've experienced material rate increases, seen a tightening in terms and conditions; optimized our portfolios through underwriting action and risk selection; adjusted attachment points; managed limits and diversified our portfolios. While we are seeing size of these underwriting actions producing more positive loss experience, coupled with a decline in the number of security class action filings in recent years, we remain cautious in recognizing those benefits considering the uncertainties around the longer-term impacts of inflation. Overall, we feel we are very well positioned heading into 2023. Despite the challenging economic environment, we are pleased with our overall results for the past two years and remain focused on delivering consistent top financial performance to contribute to the growth and the value of the overall Markel Corporation. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. We showed significant improvement this year, producing a 92% combined for the year compared to 105% a year ago. Our reinsurance team has done a fantastic job of re-underwriting our book and reducing volatility over the last few years, to focus on long-term profitability within our core casualty, professional and specialty product lines. We're starting to see more of the better priced business earned through the results. Gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment were only down 1% for the year, demonstrating our ability to remix the portfolio away from property, which we serve through Nephila and growing our preferred lines. Ultimately, we're not focused on growth for the sake of growth within our reinsurance operations, but rather our energy is aimed at being a profitable, durable reinsurer that is relevant to the clients we support. Next, I'll touch on program services and fronting operations, and our insurance-linked securities operations, both of which are recorded as part of our other operations. Our State National program services and Nephila ILS teams continue to remain focused on capturing market opportunities and partnering with our underwriting divisions to take advantage of synergies available within our multifaceted insurance platform. As a reminder, almost all of our gross written premium within our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $3.4 billion for the year versus $3 billion a year ago. Premium growth was due to both expansion of existing programs and the addition of new programs. It was also due to growing within our other fronting operations generated from the transition of our Global Reinsurance division's property business to Nephila and opportunities we see in the property cat space more broadly. Fee revenues were up 19% from a year ago, and the operations continued to produce strong operating margins. Despite increasing competition in this segment, we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market. In our Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the year were down due to the impact of selling our Velocity and Volante MGA operations in 2022. The net loss from operations in our ILS unit was driven largely by the costs incurred at Volante from launching a Lloyd's syndicate prior to disposition. A highlight this year from our ILS operations was our successful execution of the sale of Nephila's two MGA entities during the year, realizing gains of totaling $226 million and unlocking significant value created since our acquisition of Nephila in 2018. Assets under management in Nephila were $7.2 billion at the end of 2022. As we have previously discussed, the past several years of cat activity have been particularly difficult on both Nephila and the ILS market as a whole. The multiple years of event losses, coupled with recent volatility in the capital markets have impacted investor decisions to allocate capital to ILS, reducing our level of assets under management. Additionally, increases in the cost of capital during 2022, driven by a higher interest rate environment, further impacted the estimated fair value of our fund management operations. The combination of these factors ultimately resulted in a partial impairment of goodwill attributed to our fund management operations in the fourth quarter of $8 million. We remain confident that Nephila will produce more favorable results over the long term. Pricing in the property catastrophe market is strong and Nephila achieved significant rate increases at the 1/1 renewals and expects to continue to capitalize on improving pricing as the year progresses, which will lead to an improved outlook for investor returns. Our team in Nephila continues to identify new areas of opportunity to deploy capital to address the evolving areas of risk management needs, including the expansion of our climate and specialty product offerings. We also continue to look for opportunities to achieve synergies amongst our various insurance platforms, underwriting program services and ILS to provide customized insurance solutions, best matching capital risk to meet the needs of our customers. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities remained strong in the fourth quarter end at 1/1. Despite ongoing concerns around the economic slowdown and the broader macroeconomic backdrop, there's a strong need for insurance protection and risk management solutions across the wide array of products we offer. During the fourth quarter, we saw rate increases moderate in pockets of our broad portfolio. For example, financial institutions and large account risk managed excess casualty. We also experienced modest rate decreases in our public D&O portfolio. However, most lines maintained the level of increase experienced over the year. And within our property lines, as you might suspect, rates have begun to increase meaningfully given the recent loss activity, a supply-demand mismatch and higher reinsurance costs. As we've been assessing in recent quarters, we have entered a more nuanced space of a broader insurance market cycle where different product lines have different patterns, and we continue to face uncertainty pertaining to inflation in all its forms. As such, we remain laser-focused on rate adequacy in each account that we write, looking at -- to our underwriter stack with discipline. Fortunately, there are a number of opportunities to grow profitably given our broad product range capabilities, global footprint, exceptional talent and strong trading relationships across multiple distribution channels. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to be discerning and only write business that meets our profitability targets. With regards to our outward ceded reinsurance placements, we anticipated a challenging environment that was experienced in the fourth quarter ended 1/1. Our team did an exceptional job putting together our placements. We avoided any surprises and importantly any delays in placement or gaps in our programs. Coverage, attachment and pricing were all within expectations, despite some changes year-over-year. We're well positioned to pass costs along and don't anticipate any meaningful changes to our margins or underlying underwriting strategies. In summary, I feel good about how we are positioned heading into 2023. We'll continue to focus on the things we can control, and be aware of and react to the things we cannot. I want to take a moment to thank my 5,000 colleagues across our insurance businesses. Without their efforts and passion to serve our customers, these results would not be possible. Because of them, it is a joy for me to come and to work. Thank you. And I'll turn things back over to Tom. Yes. Sure, Mark, it's Jeremy. So, a few comments on that maybe to build off what I shared. So, I would say that in the fourth quarter across the total portfolio, the level of rate increases would have slightly dipped below the level of the trend that we're applying. So that was a development. But driven by some of the lines that I called out specifically, like public D&O, like financial institutions, like risk-managed excess casualty, those sorts of lines. Many of the trends that have been talked about, say, for example, workers' compensation, have been pretty consistent with regards to sort of modest levels of sort of price decreases. And many other areas of the portfolio have broadly held on to the rate, property and certainly one that's been improving. So, we're starting to see different cycles and patterns, if you will, across each of our products. And while I think that is an interesting unfoldment of point to look at level of rate increases and to look at sort of how we're thinking about trend in those product lines, I think what we are most focused on within each of our product lines is where we are with regards to rate adequacy. And that's sort of what we incorporate into our thinking with regards to how we come into 2023 and operate throughout this year. And we'll see. I mean, I think with regards to take casualty, more broadly speaking, I think that's one for the industry to watch very carefully. I think we should be very sensitive to what's happening with regards to rate and trend in that space. Yes. Yes, exactly. So level of rate increase relative to loss cost trend. And those two things were moving the opposite direction. Over the course of 2022 loss cost trends, we were incorporating were increasing over the course of 2020, broadly speaking, and again, we write over 100 major product lines. The levels of rate increases were declining a little bit. Well, I can't possibly comment on what others may see. And what I would say for us -- two stories, right? So, if we take general liability with NGL, we had a specific look at our brokerage contractors primary casualty book. Last few quarters, we were seeing actual claims experience exceed what we expected in our models, and we've been reacting along the way. And we decided to take a deeper look in the fourth quarter given there seems to be that trend emerging. Our main takeaway is that the ultimate claims reporting pattern may be a little bit longer than we initially anticipated. I think -- some of those causes can be the growth in the book that we experienced over the past 10 years. There's some larger project work in that book. And ultimately, that may take longer to settle. And then there's no doubt that the court closures with the pandemic length in the tail. Those factors get exacerbated by the unfavorable legal environment that we face and a rising cost of inflation. And that is not going to be unique to us, but I can't speak to what others are sort of doing in that space. We were very cautious. We put up additional IBNR across those maturing accident years. We'll see how things play out over time. In Professional, we're speaking to our large risk-managed E&O and D&O accounts in the U.S. where we offer larger limits. We tend to play in an excess position in the years in question. We would often be in high access positions. What we've begun to have some concern around is an emergence of a pattern where it may be more likely that our layers get implicated than we previously anticipated. And we're seeing some of that already. We've seen that in recent quarters. The good news is, right, in that quote, there's not much of a claim reporting tale. We're talking a claims-made book of business. It's a finite claims universe. And so, we got our underwriting claims and actuarial teams together in the fourth quarter, took a deep dive, ultimately concluded that we would take a more pessimistic view with regards to how many claims we could be exposed to. There's no doubt in my mind the rising costs to defend, increasing settlement amounts are linked with a more inflationary environment we're experiencing, and that's the impetus for our development. Again, that isn't going to be unique to us, but I can't speak to how others are handling that. The years in question as well on the professional side, they correspond at the peak years for security class action filings, lower court dismissals and now that's kind of playing out. Importantly, I think across our books of business, those were experiencing on the tail end of the last soft insurance market cycle. Since then, we've had the better part of four years of rate increases, and we've done a lot on the underwriting side, terms, conditions, limits profiles, attachments. We've seen retentions increase from clients. So, we've taken a lot of underwriting action and now we'll just take a very sort of cautious view on the most recent years, and we'll see how that plays out. As you know us, we react to bad news very quickly, and we're pretty cautious with regards to the economic backdrop at the moment. Well, I think that's the part. It's a little bit down to the appetite. So, we certainly have the ability to grow and the capital to deploy supporting growth if we're happy with the pricing and the terms and condition and the environment. I mean it is the case that while property got a lot of the headlines around 1/1, casualty, professional specialty lines where we play, definitely were firmer acting as a more disciplined market and we will see improvements with regards to coverage attachment and pricing in our portfolio as we move this year. We will opportunistically take advantage where it makes sense in that space. Yes. We worked really hard in the last few years to reduce -- so property has multiple stories to it, right? I mean there's obviously the catastrophe side and sort of the non-catastrophe side. We worked really hard over the last few years to manage our total aggregate exposure to natural catastrophes, our PMLs in that space. And I don't think we're going to change or revisit that position to any great extent. But we do play in that space. We do have a meaningful property portfolio. We will benefit from the rate increases in our property portfolio, where we deploy capacity without a doubt. We can see and strategically grow in that area a little bit. And I think we'll also benefit from even on the attritional side, it's what's happening in the rate increases. So, we're really focused on sort of managing our aggregate exposure. We'll opportunistically use this as a time to optimize our portfolio. I would not anticipate or expect any significant change in our underlying strategy with regards to property."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Let me add my welcome to the Markel Corporation third quarter conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to our quarterly call. I'm joined this morning by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. They will update you on our overall financial results and our insurance operations in just a minute. But before they do, and as they say in the news business, don't swallow the headline. Well, here's the headline. Things are going very well at Markel. I'm delighted to share these results with you full stop. Now I recognize that when you look at the headline numbers that may not be your immediate reaction. So please let me share a few points of you that might help you enjoy the same sense of progress and optimism that I have. First, our insurance operations are solidly profitable and growing at the same time. Richie and Jeremy will give you more numbers and details on this. But from my point of view, during these sorts of underwriting profits and to be growing and to continue to report favorable reserve development in the face of ongoing large-scale natural catastrophes such as Ian and ongoing inflationary pressures, whether CPI flavor or social flavor is fantastic. I am so proud of and grateful for our insurance operations and the results they are posting. We've had some bumps along the way and pieces and parts of our insurance operations in the last few years, but I think these results validate the hard work, the hard decisions, the discipline and the dedication of the people of our insurance operations. I also think these results bode well for the future. Second, our reinsurance operations posted solid profitability in the face of all of the challenging factors I just noted. The ongoing high levels of property catastrophe losses for the industry would normally correlate the tough results in our reinsurance business. We've spoken for the last several years about what we've done to improve our reinsurance results, and I hope these numbers provide you with some assurance that we're on the right track. More importantly, I think these reinsurance results speak to something very important about our culture. There's no question that reinsurance results were far from optimal in recent years. As is always the case around every aspect of Markel, we did our best to figure out what was wrong, what we needed to improve and then we went about the work, the hard work of making things better. As is always the case, we didn't deny there was a problem and we didn't run away from it. We just went to work every day and concentrated on making it better. We've sensed internally the things have been better in our reinsurance operations for a while now, but with the time lags involved in insurance accounting, it takes a while for those results to be visible in our financial reporting. Additionally, in which should emphasize the improvement, consider the asset test of the modest impact of Ian on our results. In Sherlock Holmes terms, Ian was the dog that didn't bite. I hope that you can now share our confidence that we're on the right track in reinsurance and that it will be a valuable contributor to our overall results going forward. Third, Markel Ventures continues to set new records in revenues and profitability. Markel Ventures provides doses of resiliency, optionality, culture and cash to the Markel Corporation. The people of Ventures continue to operate in challenging environments of supply chain challenges, tough labor markets, inflationary pressures and increasing regulatory burdens. Despite these ongoing challenges, the Ventures teams continue to set new records. I can't thank them enough for their ongoing and unrelenting commitment to excellence. Fourth, our State National and Nephila operations continue to make progress. The performance of State National continues to go from strength to strength. There are also two important items of note at Nephila that I hope encourage you. One is that we've received proceeds of over $300 million from the sales of the two MGA operations or part of Nephila. Secondly, as we roll through another difficult year of industry catastrophe losses, the performance of the Nephila funds demonstrates the underwriting process is creating investment results that track expectations. The impact of storms like Ian and other industry losses are developing along the lines expected by our modeling and loss expectation methodology, and that bodes well for the future. Fourth, investments. Wait, what? On the surface, the well-known decline to both equity and bond markets are penalizing current reported returns. That's true. But what does that mean? The answer is it depends. If markets were going down, and we had to sell our investments at the same time, that would be awful. If markets were going down and we just stood past, that would probably be okay but not wonderful. If markets were going down and we were steadily buying more equity securities and bonds with higher interest income and our own stock at lower prices. That would be fantastic. I'm delighted to report to you that our circumstances today are exactly that. We're buying. That adds to the overall earning power of Markel over time. Fifth, so far this year, we've repaid $350 million of senior long-term debt, and we repurchased $208 million of Markel stock. That amount almost doubles what we repurchased in the first nine months of last year. Sixth, our recurring, recurring net investment income of the interest income and dividends you receive continue to grow. During the quarter, that line item grew 18% from $91 million to $108 million. I think we can reasonably expect to see ongoing increases in recurring, recurring investment income for the foreseeable future. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Jeremy, I like our hand. You, as our shareholders, own a profitable insurance operation that has grown. We're investing this profits at positive long-term rates of return in additional insurance opportunities, publicly-traded securities, Ventures operations and our own shares. You're hungry for good returns from your investment and so are we. You can picture Markel as a pizza. The size of the overall pizza is growing, and we're cutting it into fewer slices. Seems to me like the value of each slice is growing. I'm guessing the market will see it that way in the fullness of time. With that, we'll shift away from the talk of pizza, and I'll turn it now to Jeremy to provide more color and details on the financial results. Jeremy?\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We often talk of win-win wins and of the importance of being an organization for which others are better off for being associated with. It's events like Ian that remind us of this virtue and where we must follow through. I'm incredibly proud of our associates who are tirelessly supporting our customers and the local communities that have been impacted. Whether we look to our settling of claims to get people back on their feet with the supply of building materials to help restore, Markel is actively working to improve the situation, and our thoughts continue to be with people of Florida at this time. We remain pleased with the strong performance of our insurance and Markel Ventures operations. We are confident in the quality and durability of our investment portfolio as we as well as our ability to execute against our operating plans within our Insurance and Ventures businesses. We continue to find opportunities to allocate capital across our three engines, and we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value. Overall, it's been a pretty solid first three quarters of the year. Looking first to our underwriting results, gross written premiums surpassed $7.5 billion for the first nine months of 2022 compared to $6.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 19%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, strong policy retention levels, more favorable rates and expanded product offerings. Our professional liability and general liability product lines continue to lead the way, but we also achieved meaningful growth across many of our other product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio was 91 for the first nine months of both 2022 and 2021. Our 2022 combined ratio included $70 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian, and $35 million attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which combined added two points to the year-to-date combined ratio. All losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognized in the first quarter and our initial estimates associated with this event remain unchanged. In 2021, we incurred $182 million or four points of net losses from natural catastrophes in the first nine months. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of the year was an 89% compared to 87% for the same period one. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $204 million in the first nine months of this year compared to $366 million in the first nine months of last year. In 2022, among the reasons we experienced lower favorable development was due to greater-than-anticipated claims settlements and increased claims frequency and severity trends in certain of our professional liability product lines within our Insurance segment. The impact of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims, particularly on our longer tail product lines such as professional liability and general liability. As a result, we are approaching reductions in prior year loss reserves cautiously, particularly on more recent accident years. As I've stated last quarter and consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increased loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. In instances where claims trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we're often waiting to reduce our loss reserves, and we'll evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income were $2.2 billion in the first nine months of the year were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the period. This compares to net investment gains of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of last year, attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance. We continue to maintain our investing discipline, understanding the periodic cost and the equity markets are to be expected and will result in the variability and timing of the investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of September, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $3.9 billion. With regards to net investment income, we reported $274 million in the first nine months of this year compared to $284 million in the same period last year. The decrease reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments this year compared to income from equity method investments last year. Net investment income on our fixed maturity securities this year was up slightly compared to last year. The impact of higher average holdings and fixed maturity securities this -- in the current year was mostly offset by lower yield compared to the same period a year ago. We're beginning to see the benefit of higher interest rates on our net investment income through recent purchases of higher-yielding fixed maturity securities. That impact will become more meaningful in future periods as lower-yielding securities mature and continue to be replaced with higher-yielding securities. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases began to exceed the average book yield of our portfolio. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $1.3 billion net of taxes during the first nine months of this year, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. As a reminder, we typically hold our fixed maturities until immature. We generally expect these unrealized losses to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our portfolio has an average rating of AAA and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 31% to $3.5 billion for the first nine months of 2022 compared to $2.7 billion for the same period last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont, and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as organic growth across many of our other businesses, most notably in our Construction Services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $353 million for the first nine months of this year compared to $304 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results across several businesses as well as the contribution of Metromont. Looking at our consolidated results for the first nine months of this year. Our year-to-date results demonstrate how well our core operations are navigating the current economic environment and executing at a high level. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $922 million for the first nine months of this year compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.5 billion for the same period a year ago. This was largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first nine months was $2.2 billion compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $1.3 billion in the first nine months of last year. Again, this was driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. It's worth highlighting that given the magnitude of our equity portfolio, we believe generally accepted accounting principles, which require that we include unrealized gains and losses on equity securities in net income, create volatility in revenues and net income, which can obscure the strong operating performance of our businesses. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion in the first nine months of this year compared to $1.6 billion in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2022 reflected strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders' equity stood at $12.3 billion at the end of September compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. Again, this decline is driven by declines in both the fixed maturity and public equity valuations, as I previously discussed. July 1, we retired $315 million to 4.9% unsecured senior notes. And during the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased 163,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance business.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. We produced another strong quarter of operating results within our insurance businesses benefiting from reduced volatility within our underwriting operations. This was partially achieved through adjustments in our property catastrophe underwriting strategy and appetite over the past few years. Our combined ratio for the quarter of 93 includes Hurricane Ian, a significant industry catastrophe event. Ian added four points of underwriting loss to our third quarter combined ratio. In previous years, the impact of a catastrophe event of this size would have had a more adverse impact on our underwriting results. We continue to see strong top line growth across our product lines achieving 19% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date periods within our underwriting operations. Total underwriting premium production passed $7.5 billion for the nine months. This exceeds the total underwriting production volume for the full year just two years ago in 2020. While we continue to benefit from mid- to high single-digit rate increases across our underwriting operations, our production growth has also been significantly influenced by new business growth, the development of new products and the on-boarding of new program relationships. Our focus on expense discipline and scaling our operations produced a year-to-date expense ratio of 33%, representing a two-point improvement from a year ago. Consistent with my comments last quarter and Jeremy's comments, we remain cautious in our approach to recognizing prior year loss reserve takedowns in keeping with our conservative reserving philosophy. While we are seeing favorable actual versus expected loss trends in many of our product lines in the most recent accident years, we are being cautious about realizing these potential benefits until the impact from various forms of inflation and core processing delays are more fully understood. Now, I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, program services and fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. So let's dive into the Insurance segment first. Gross written premiums and earned premiums in the Insurance segment were up 21% for the first nine months of this year. We realized 15% or higher premium growth across all our major product lines with the exception of workers' compensation which while growing continues to face small rate decreases. Premium growth was most notable in our general liability and professional liability product lines. The combined ratio for the first nine months of the year in the Insurance segment was 91% compared to 88% last year. The current year combined ratio included $90 million or just under two points of net losses related to Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine war versus $89 million or just over two points of net losses last year, related to 2021 catastrophes. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio increased by three points due to less favorable development on prior year losses, partially offset by a lower expense ratio due to benefit from higher earned premiums and relatively flat operating expenses. The lower favorable development on prior accident year losses was driven by lower takedowns in our longer-tail product lines, such as our U.S. general liability and professional liability books. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking a conscious approach in our reserving process to realizing prior accident year loss takedowns. And at the same time, we are reacting quickly to pockets of adverse development. We also increased our attritional current accident year loss ratio in the third quarter within these product lines to reflect the claims trends we have been seeing in the past few quarters including responding to general inflationary trends. On a year-to-date basis, our current accident year attritional loss ratio remains down slightly versus the prior year as pricing and underwriting actions are modestly ahead of claims trend. Turning next to our reinsurance segment. Gross written and earned premiums within the segment were up 5% for the first nine months of the year. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines from both new business and higher renewals due to import to more favorable rates along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments in our general liability and credit and surety lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers' compensation lines due to non-renewals. Our property line continues to run off as part of our catastrophe strategy with the transition of our reinsurance property line to Nephila and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. The reduction in workers' compensation was due to the non-renewal of a large quota share treaty in the first quarter. The combined ratio for the first nine months of the year within the Reinsurance segment is 93% versus 108% a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $15 million or two points of net losses from the Ukraine war compared to $93 million or 12 points of net losses last year related to 2021 catastrophe events. The transition of our reinsurance property lines and the exit of retro reinsurance lines resulted in reduced volatility, which significantly benefited our Reinsurance segment's underwriting results. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased by five points from a year ago, primarily due to favorable development on prior accident year losses this year versus adverse development last year. The segment had two points of favorable loss development this year due to favorable loss development in our credit and surety and property product lines, partially offset by the impact from favorable prior year premium adjustments. Last year, the segment was impacted by four points of adverse development, primarily within our property product lines including three points of adverse development related to losses attributed to COVID-19. We continue to make progress towards our combined ratio target of 90%. Excluding cat and specific events, year-to-date, we're sitting at a 91% versus 93% a year ago. Significant efforts made by Jed Rhoads and our reinsurance team around re-underwriting a reinsurance portfolio are starting to show through in the financial results. As we announced last quarter, Jed is going to be retiring at the end of the year after an incredible 40-plus years in the reinsurance industry. We thank him for all of his contributions to Markel, including successfully repositioning our global reinsurance operations for sustainable, profitable growth. Next, I'll touch on our program services and other funding operations in our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Our program services and other funding operations continue to grow with total premium production of $2.6 billion this year versus $2.3 billion last year and produced total revenues of $105 million this year, up 18% from a year ago. Margins in this area of our business remain strong, as does our new business pipeline. Within our Nephila operations, operating revenue from the year were down versus last year due primarily to the disposition of our Velocity MGA operations in February. We recognized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter of this year associated with that transaction. Further, we finalized the sale of our Volante MGA in October for an estimated cash consideration of $155 million, the gain from which will be recognized in our fourth quarter results. Nephila's assets under management were $7.8 billion as of September 30, 2022. While Hurricane Ian had a significant impact on investor returns, we invested the estimated losses were consistent with Nephila's expectations for an event of this magnitude. Nevertheless, the significant Ian loss and investor fatigue around recent cat activity will continue to adversely impact assets under management. I'll end with a few comments about market conditions and outlook as we look to finish the year strong. As I think everyone knows, we are currently transitioning leadership of our insurance engine over to Jeremy Noble. And he and I will be happy to take questions during Q&A. As I noted earlier and as noted on many of our peers' earnings calls, rates continue to gradually moderate in most lines. Exceptions continue to be cat exposed property in lines such as aviation, terrorism, war and political violence, which has been impacted by the Ukraine war and other large events, including Hurricane Ian. We continue to see strong submissions, new business opportunities and total premium writings despite uncertain financial markets and fears related to a potential economic slowdown. Inflation in all its forms continues to be a significant focus for us and the industry. As I discussed last quarter, going into '22, we had already baked more inflation into our pricing and loss reserving. During the third quarter, we adopted an even more cautious approach, which impacted both our prior accident year reserve releases and our current accident year loss picks. As has always been our philosophy, we will respond quickly to potential adverse trends and will be slow to recognize positive trends until they can be confirmed. Most of our products pricing bases are impacted by inflation, and this helps to some extent to offset claims trend. However, we are not prepared to rely on this to maintain rate adequacy. While overall market conditions remain favorable, we have been disappointed to see more price competition in certain lines of business. We see absolutely no justification for price decreases given all the risk factors we have previously discussed. We are going to continue to push for what we believe are must-have rate increases and we are prepared to walk away from business that is not adequately priced. Fortunately, we feel we're well positioned to both act with discipline and grow profitably given our broad product diversification and market-leading capabilities. Interestingly, we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter this year in a remarkably similar position to 2021. We need a strong finish to the year to achieve our profitability goals of a 90% combined ratio or better. We know our team will continue to work hard in pursuit of this goal. Thank you for your time today. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. I hope that I conveyed my optimism and gratitude for how all three of our engines are firing these days and our overall circumstances at Markel opening comments. I think the best I can do at this point is just to open the floor for questions. So with that, Regina?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yes. I wonder what you can say in terms of signals you're getting about the economy when you look at your insurance operations, also the Ventures, you say construction is doing pretty well and curious whether you're seeing any kind of signs of things may be slowing?\nTom Gayner: Yes. Thanks Mark. It is an incredible value to have the windows that we have both through what each individual underwriter would see and what we see through the various businesses that we're in across the economy. And what I'll tell you is, it's hard and it's challenging. And every single business is dealing with labor issues, supply issues and inflationary pressures. But at the same time, we continue to increase prices in response to increased cost, and there's plenty of business to be done. So it keeps on keeping on.\nMark Hughes: Very good. I think when you look at the Reinsurance segment, obviously, post property is hardening up. Is that spilling over into other lines? And is that going to create opportunity within reinsurance or insurance in the Insurance segment as well?\nJeremy Noble: Mark, it's Jeremy. Maybe I'll start on that. I think you're right to point out, and there's property is certainly part of the story. I think marine and aviation lines because of this year's events are also part of the story. So, we see it if we're on the table relative to our outworks programs, and we see where we're at the table from our inwards programs. The conversations are definitely a little more intense. And I think capacity is a little more scarce, and I think that is creating a little bit of a firming opportunity. So I would anticipate that, that has broader implications across casualty and specialty lines as well. So, we're going to see you learn a lot more, I think, in the next few months. But we've seen a little bit of a gap differential over the last couple of years between house where the primary insurance base is working in the reinsurance space. And I would say it's certainly hardening more right now in the reinsurance space.\nMark Hughes: Can really think about your growth in insurance, the 21% in written this quarter? I hear your description of in pockets of price competition, you've been careful about inflation. You also say the pricing increases are moderating, but you're still seeing -- in looking at the written premium growth that you're seeing a lot of good opportunity. Any way to kind of square all of that? The optimism in the P&L versus the caution in the language and description here?\nTom Gayner: I think the way to square it is, is your right, Mark, things are good and language in the way we speak, we're inherently conservative people. We always have been. We always will be. So we never want to take things for granted. We never want to surge good things, but things are pretty good.\nJeremy Noble: And Mark, maybe, Jeremy, I'll add to that. I mean I think this is a demonstration of the work that we've been hard at across our insurance operations for quite some time. So I think we benefit from broad product diversification, global capabilities, strong trading relationships, a multi-distribution platform. We are achieving rate. We got new product innovation. So that's allowing us to grow, but what we're laser focused on is growing profitably. So at the same time, I think we have the ability to act with a high degree of discipline. That squares comments about the importance around rate adequacy, the importance of discipline and the importance of knowing when we got to push away from the table or put the bend down with the opportunity for us to grow at present as well as what I think that portends for future quarters. And that's what we've been hard at work at.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Let me start with an accounting question. The $53.4 million of reserve release that related to CATCo. Am I correct understanding that you guys were effectively just a pass-through for that? It passed through one line and then back out through the minority interest? Or was there any other plus or minus that was caught up somewhere else in the results that may not have been obvious?\nJeremy Noble: Mark, it's Jeremy. Well, you make a great account. So yes, you're exactly right. It's really just geography. So, that is a straight pass-through any. We continue to wind down the reserves. We continue to execute computations where we can, where there are savings that passes through to the benefit of the original investors. We see that the sort of the benefit come through as favorable in the other expenses. The offset is a non-controlling interest kind of below the line. Just be aware of that.\nMark Dwelle: Right. Okay. And my old accounting professor would be proud that I retained any of it. So anyway, the second question that I have and this may be probably for Jeremy and Richie. I mean you've talked about your increasing caution on the reserving and on the loss picks. Yet, we've got some pretty decent pricing still, and we obviously have inflation. Can you just talk kind of -- for year-to-date, we're still an improved accident year margin. Can you just talk about kind of the evolution of your thinking on that over the course of the year? And I guess all else equal, I mean, could it -- I guess it could have been better had inflation not been as severe as it's been. Is that the right way to think?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, Mark, I'll start and maybe Rich will jump in. I think that is a good way to think and won't necessarily get into numbers or certainly a line by line of view. But overall, I think we feel that rate and underwriting actions are keeping just ahead of trend. And that expands to our acknowledgment that in an inflationary environment, exposure has an effect of acting like rate to a certain degree as well. So, that is why we are incredibly focused on rate adequacy. If we were in an elevated inflationary environment, without a doubt, the results would even be stronger. I think you know us well and Richie touched upon this earlier, we have a very long-standing philosophy with regards to how to approach reserves, focused on more likely redundant than deficient, focused on reacting to bad news, if you will, very quickly and taking a much more measured view to good news.  That's anywhere over time where we are in a cycle, but I think that's even more so the case now. So feel like despite a patio environment, right, we can take those actions that Richie and I were mentioning. We can still generate favorable prior year development. We can, in fact, maintain or improve our confidence in our loss reserves, and we can still generate certainly on an ex-cat basis, a combined 90 year but that's a pretty good place, I think, for us to be at this stage.\nRichie Whitt: Yes. I'll just add a -- just real quickly, Mark, I'll just add. It's been a while since anybody has seen inflationary pressures like the ones we've seen recently. And so, we're having to kind of reeducate underwriters, actuaries, accountants, everybody. I mean, Tom and I have seen this kind of inflation, but a lot of the rest of the people around here have not. So, it's safety first at Markel, and it always has been that way in terms of the reserves. And we'll -- we're more than happy to make sure the reserves are at the confidence level that we want. And if that means there's potentially some reserve decreases down the road, that's great. But I think that's how we're trying to view this current situation.\nMark Dwelle: I appreciate those comments. And I guess with that in mind, it kind of raises two maybe follow-up questions directly to that point. So if you're kind of at conservative plus in terms of thinking about accident year picks and reserving, what are the signposts you're looking for that would move you back to just merely conservative? That would be the first question. And then the second, I mean, as you weigh up the pricing environment now, the inflationary trends that you're seeing, would it still be the case that more likely than not accident year margins would improve next year? Or you're not willing to go that far?\nRichie Whitt: I think it's hard to say whether things -- accident market -- margins improve because we got a lot of unknown variables, right? We don't know what the rate increases are going to be next year, and we also don't know what the true rate of inflation is. I know you're going to hate this answer, but the true thing that we need to be able to start potentially reducing our loss picks and increasing prior year releases is time. We need to see it. So I think it's just a matter -- it's going to be a matter of time. And given current risk factors, I think it will take more time.\nTom Gayner: Yes. I'll jump in just, Mark, with some formal accounting comments here. You remember the movie, My Cousin Vinny, was a scene in there where the character that was played by Joe Pesci was hustling some pull and he got into a little bit of a match with some of the locals there, and they wanted to bet. And he said, \"Well, where's your month to back up that bet.\" You asked them to show them the cash of the states that they wanted to be for. And of course, they didn't happen. And it was a recurring risk it came back and they had a big lot of money and he says, \"Well, how do I know that isn't just a bunch of ones for the 20 wrapped around it and turn that's exactly what it was.\" Well, the good news when we're debating and trying to think about how this reserve -- how the reserves might develop over time, remember, we did collect the premiums upfront. We do have the cash for what we're talking about. Now we'll see how they develop over time. But we do hold the cash. And we are investing the cash at higher and higher rates of return. So we continue to operate in the belief that we want our reserves to be more likely to be redundant and efficient. And we have the cash while we're waiting for, as Richard said, time, just to say to claim the level, it's done, we know. In the meantime, economically, we're earning the returns from our capital.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. I think that's the first in 20 years of doing this. That's the first My Cousin Vinny reference I've ever gotten in response to a question that I've asked. But that way, I won't have to ask you whether -- if Markel is a pizza, if you're a New York style or a Chicago style, I think you've shown your colors on that one.\nMark Hughes: I don't know. I know what we're eating for lunch now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management.\nJohn Fox: Yes. First, congratulations on the reinsurance results. I have a number of questions for Tom. Tom, you've been holding on to about $2 billion of short-term investments for quite some time and another $3 billion of cash. And there's been no opportunity cost for doing that. But today, there is although short-term rates, you can make a decent return. Can you talk about the opportunity cost today? And would you invest some of that cash and short-term investments and increase the yield going forward?\nTom Gayner: Well, the good news is, while there's a lot of chatter and conversation about that issue over the last year or so. With hindsight, in retrospect, it looks in a pretty good decision. So the rates of return on that cash are going up. And we are deploying it, as we talked about in terms of buying equities and repurchasing our own stock. And given the profitability of the capital position, what we'll do is to continue to invest in a methodical and disciplined way. I'm not going to chuck it into the market all at once. We'll do the same thing we always do, just steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, incremental, incremental, incremental, iterate, iterate, iterate to a better return. But avenue market forecast, I have no crystal ball. Well, we're going the month work.\nJohn Fox: Yes. I guess billion of short-term investments, right? Could that be $1.2 billion and $600 million of corporates where you could earn 5%, 6% on pretty short duration, like are you thinking about that? Or we're moving to 4%, 4.5% on short term, and that's okay.\nTom Gayner: Yes. It's not awful, especially compared to what it had.\nJohn Fox: That's very clear.\nTom Gayner: Yes, John, I can call a conversation with you many, many years ago where you made the comment about Mark House. They may not always do what you want them to do, but they will always do what they say they will do. So you and I are in agreement, and we might pace it a little differently than you would if our roles will reverse, but we're doing the same thing.\nJohn Fox: Your answer is very clear. The other point on investment income and sometimes on these calls, we get an interesting lecture on account. And I would say that -- and I like your reaction to this. I think your net investment income is actually doing better than you suggested. If I read the Q correctly, the $108 million of net investment income includes about $5 million of marks from Hagerty.\nTom Gayner: Yes, I think it's actually more than that. So the equity method investing and believe me, that's one of those in that starts around here with -- I used to be an accountant and those conversations ever. So, yes, both -- so for instance, there was one investment that we made probably 10 or 12 years ago, and I cannot recall with Precision whether it was $25 million or $50 million, but it was one of those two numbers. And I think we've recognized cumulative gains and losses of well over $100 million each way of gains and loss over time, depending on the mark-to-market that quarter. It's the same thing that happened when we grow to the credit default swap that we end up having a wonderful experience with long time ago. The quarterly swings that come through equity method accounting do indeed obscure what's really happening in fundamental economics. So you're reading the queue right, and that's why I used the new term of recurring, recurring net investment income this year. I think through the first nine months, the number is about $50 million in total on the equity method things. If you took that out of the mix and with the recurring, recurring net investment income, it is going up at a faster rate than what was reported in this quarter's results.\nJeremy Noble: John, it's Jeremy. Just to piggyback, John, here just to piggyback off Tom's comments. All of our equity method investments are included in that line item. So it's not just Hagerty. So, I want to make that point. And then Tom is exactly right. The year-over-year shift is $50 million. So instead of on a nine-month basis being down $10 million, we'll be up $40 million.\nJohn Fox: Right. That's my point, right.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Exactly.\nJohn Fox: The recurring investment income from the portfolio is growing and increasing the return on equity. Is that the right way to think about it?\nJeremy Noble: Yes.\nJohn Fox: And to add insult to injury on the Hagerty piece, it's worth about $0.5 billion more than what's on the financial statements, right?\nTom Gayner: That is correct.\nJohn Fox: Okay. And then...\nTom Gayner: Yes, so call it $0.5 billion. The only thing we've ever recognized is our losses.\nJohn Fox: Right. Okay. And then, Tom, final question for you. On the venture side, if I look at the products, I take the products revenue and subtracted expenses, it's about a 1% margin, which is, I'm sure, not reflecting a reality. Could you talk about anything that went on there in the third quarter? Is there anything unusual? Or is that seasonality?\nTom Gayner: Yes. I don't know. I know one of the things that would be going on in terms of the EBITDA profitability of the book and the set of businesses is to the extent that we have distribution businesses, those are high volume, low margin, but a wonderful return on capital. And the mix is skewing a bit that way at the moment, but I have to look at and think about the exact thing you're asking about, don't know.\nJohn Fox: Okay. Great. And then, Richie, for you. Typically, ILS has had a big fourth quarter. That's been their best quarter for profitability, I guess as things get trued up from the investment year. Do you expect that to happen again this year? Or with the hurricane? Is that off the table?\nRichie Whitt: I guess I'd have to say, John, I don't know. The fourth quarter is usually when you look hard at the side pockets and see if they can be released and that releases trapped fees. I don't know where that will stand this year just simply because of -- like you say, Ian, I think there's going to be quite a bit of focus on making sure you get reserves correct for Ian also in terms of this is the cap time that you do capital raising. So I guess, sorry, the answer is I don't know.\nJohn Fox: Okay. That's fine. I appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you for joining us. Be well. We'll talk to you again in about another 90 days.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Let me add my welcome to the Markel Corporation third quarter conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, and it's my pleasure to welcome you to our quarterly call. I'm joined this morning by my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. They will update you on our overall financial results and our insurance operations in just a minute. But before they do, and as they say in the news business, don't swallow the headline. Well, here's the headline. Things are going very well at Markel. I'm delighted to share these results with you full stop. Now I recognize that when you look at the headline numbers that may not be your immediate reaction. So please let me share a few points of you that might help you enjoy the same sense of progress and optimism that I have. First, our insurance operations are solidly profitable and growing at the same time. Richie and Jeremy will give you more numbers and details on this. But from my point of view, during these sorts of underwriting profits and to be growing and to continue to report favorable reserve development in the face of ongoing large-scale natural catastrophes such as Ian and ongoing inflationary pressures, whether CPI flavor or social flavor is fantastic. I am so proud of and grateful for our insurance operations and the results they are posting. We've had some bumps along the way and pieces and parts of our insurance operations in the last few years, but I think these results validate the hard work, the hard decisions, the discipline and the dedication of the people of our insurance operations. I also think these results bode well for the future. Second, our reinsurance operations posted solid profitability in the face of all of the challenging factors I just noted. The ongoing high levels of property catastrophe losses for the industry would normally correlate the tough results in our reinsurance business. We've spoken for the last several years about what we've done to improve our reinsurance results, and I hope these numbers provide you with some assurance that we're on the right track. More importantly, I think these reinsurance results speak to something very important about our culture. There's no question that reinsurance results were far from optimal in recent years. As is always the case around every aspect of Markel, we did our best to figure out what was wrong, what we needed to improve and then we went about the work, the hard work of making things better. As is always the case, we didn't deny there was a problem and we didn't run away from it. We just went to work every day and concentrated on making it better. We've sensed internally the things have been better in our reinsurance operations for a while now, but with the time lags involved in insurance accounting, it takes a while for those results to be visible in our financial reporting. Additionally, in which should emphasize the improvement, consider the asset test of the modest impact of Ian on our results. In Sherlock Holmes terms, Ian was the dog that didn't bite. I hope that you can now share our confidence that we're on the right track in reinsurance and that it will be a valuable contributor to our overall results going forward. Third, Markel Ventures continues to set new records in revenues and profitability. Markel Ventures provides doses of resiliency, optionality, culture and cash to the Markel Corporation. The people of Ventures continue to operate in challenging environments of supply chain challenges, tough labor markets, inflationary pressures and increasing regulatory burdens. Despite these ongoing challenges, the Ventures teams continue to set new records. I can't thank them enough for their ongoing and unrelenting commitment to excellence. Fourth, our State National and Nephila operations continue to make progress. The performance of State National continues to go from strength to strength. There are also two important items of note at Nephila that I hope encourage you. One is that we've received proceeds of over $300 million from the sales of the two MGA operations or part of Nephila. Secondly, as we roll through another difficult year of industry catastrophe losses, the performance of the Nephila funds demonstrates the underwriting process is creating investment results that track expectations. The impact of storms like Ian and other industry losses are developing along the lines expected by our modeling and loss expectation methodology, and that bodes well for the future. Fourth, investments. Wait, what? On the surface, the well-known decline to both equity and bond markets are penalizing current reported returns. That's true. But what does that mean? The answer is it depends. If markets were going down, and we had to sell our investments at the same time, that would be awful. If markets were going down and we just stood past, that would probably be okay but not wonderful. If markets were going down and we were steadily buying more equity securities and bonds with higher interest income and our own stock at lower prices. That would be fantastic. I'm delighted to report to you that our circumstances today are exactly that. We're buying. That adds to the overall earning power of Markel over time. Fifth, so far this year, we've repaid $350 million of senior long-term debt, and we repurchased $208 million of Markel stock. That amount almost doubles what we repurchased in the first nine months of last year. Sixth, our recurring, recurring net investment income of the interest income and dividends you receive continue to grow. During the quarter, that line item grew 18% from $91 million to $108 million. I think we can reasonably expect to see ongoing increases in recurring, recurring investment income for the foreseeable future. To summarize, before I turn the call over to Jeremy, I like our hand. You, as our shareholders, own a profitable insurance operation that has grown. We're investing this profits at positive long-term rates of return in additional insurance opportunities, publicly-traded securities, Ventures operations and our own shares. You're hungry for good returns from your investment and so are we. You can picture Markel as a pizza. The size of the overall pizza is growing, and we're cutting it into fewer slices. Seems to me like the value of each slice is growing. I'm guessing the market will see it that way in the fullness of time. With that, we'll shift away from the talk of pizza, and I'll turn it now to Jeremy to provide more color and details on the financial results. Jeremy? Thank you, Richie. I hope that I conveyed my optimism and gratitude for how all three of our engines are firing these days and our overall circumstances at Markel opening comments. I think the best I can do at this point is just to open the floor for questions. So with that, Regina? Yes. Thanks Mark. It is an incredible value to have the windows that we have both through what each individual underwriter would see and what we see through the various businesses that we're in across the economy. And what I'll tell you is, it's hard and it's challenging. And every single business is dealing with labor issues, supply issues and inflationary pressures. But at the same time, we continue to increase prices in response to increased cost, and there's plenty of business to be done. So it keeps on keeping on. I think the way to square it is, is your right, Mark, things are good and language in the way we speak, we're inherently conservative people. We always have been. We always will be. So we never want to take things for granted. We never want to surge good things, but things are pretty good. Yes. I'll jump in just, Mark, with some formal accounting comments here. You remember the movie, My Cousin Vinny, was a scene in there where the character that was played by Joe Pesci was hustling some pull and he got into a little bit of a match with some of the locals there, and they wanted to bet.

So you and I are in agreement, and we might pace it a little differently than you would if our roles will reverse, but we're doing the same thing. Yes, I think it's actually more than that.

It's the same thing that happened when we grow to the credit default swap that we end up having a wonderful experience with long time ago. The quarterly swings that come through equity method accounting do indeed obscure what's really happening in fundamental economics. So you're reading the queue right, and that's why I used the new term of recurring, recurring net investment income this year. I think through the first nine months, the number is about $50 million in total on the equity method things. If you took that out of the mix and with the recurring, recurring net investment income, it is going up at a faster rate than what was reported in this quarter's results. That is correct. Yes, so call it $0.5 billion. The only thing we've ever recognized is our losses. Yes. I don't know. I know one of the things that would be going on in terms of the EBITDA profitability of the book and the set of businesses is to the extent that we have distribution businesses, those are high volume, low margin, but a wonderful return on capital. And the mix is skewing a bit that way at the moment, but I have to look at and think about the exact thing you're asking about, don't know. Thank you for joining us. Be well. We'll talk to you again in about another 90 days."

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. We produced another strong quarter of operating results within our insurance businesses benefiting from reduced volatility within our underwriting operations. This was partially achieved through adjustments in our property catastrophe underwriting strategy and appetite over the past few years. Our combined ratio for the quarter of 93 includes Hurricane Ian, a significant industry catastrophe event. Ian added four points of underwriting loss to our third quarter combined ratio. In previous years, the impact of a catastrophe event of this size would have had a more adverse impact on our underwriting results. We continue to see strong top line growth across our product lines achieving 19% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date periods within our underwriting operations. Total underwriting premium production passed $7.5 billion for the nine months. This exceeds the total underwriting production volume for the full year just two years ago in 2020. While we continue to benefit from mid- to high single-digit rate increases across our underwriting operations, our production growth has also been significantly influenced by new business growth, the development of new products and the on-boarding of new program relationships. Our focus on expense discipline and scaling our operations produced a year-to-date expense ratio of 33%, representing a two-point improvement from a year ago. Consistent with my comments last quarter and Jeremy's comments, we remain cautious in our approach to recognizing prior year loss reserve takedowns in keeping with our conservative reserving philosophy. While we are seeing favorable actual versus expected loss trends in many of our product lines in the most recent accident years, we are being cautious about realizing these potential benefits until the impact from various forms of inflation and core processing delays are more fully understood. Now, I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, program services and fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. So let's dive into the Insurance segment first. Gross written premiums and earned premiums in the Insurance segment were up 21% for the first nine months of this year. We realized 15% or higher premium growth across all our major product lines with the exception of workers' compensation which while growing continues to face small rate decreases. Premium growth was most notable in our general liability and professional liability product lines. The combined ratio for the first nine months of the year in the Insurance segment was 91% compared to 88% last year. The current year combined ratio included $90 million or just under two points of net losses related to Hurricane Ian and the Russia-Ukraine war versus $89 million or just over two points of net losses last year, related to 2021 catastrophes. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio increased by three points due to less favorable development on prior year losses, partially offset by a lower expense ratio due to benefit from higher earned premiums and relatively flat operating expenses. The lower favorable development on prior accident year losses was driven by lower takedowns in our longer-tail product lines, such as our U.S. general liability and professional liability books. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking a conscious approach in our reserving process to realizing prior accident year loss takedowns. And at the same time, we are reacting quickly to pockets of adverse development. We also increased our attritional current accident year loss ratio in the third quarter within these product lines to reflect the claims trends we have been seeing in the past few quarters including responding to general inflationary trends. On a year-to-date basis, our current accident year attritional loss ratio remains down slightly versus the prior year as pricing and underwriting actions are modestly ahead of claims trend. Turning next to our reinsurance segment. Gross written and earned premiums within the segment were up 5% for the first nine months of the year. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines from both new business and higher renewals due to import to more favorable rates along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments in our general liability and credit and surety lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers' compensation lines due to non-renewals. Our property line continues to run off as part of our catastrophe strategy with the transition of our reinsurance property line to Nephila and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. The reduction in workers' compensation was due to the non-renewal of a large quota share treaty in the first quarter. The combined ratio for the first nine months of the year within the Reinsurance segment is 93% versus 108% a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $15 million or two points of net losses from the Ukraine war compared to $93 million or 12 points of net losses last year related to 2021 catastrophe events. The transition of our reinsurance property lines and the exit of retro reinsurance lines resulted in reduced volatility, which significantly benefited our Reinsurance segment's underwriting results. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased by five points from a year ago, primarily due to favorable development on prior accident year losses this year versus adverse development last year. The segment had two points of favorable loss development this year due to favorable loss development in our credit and surety and property product lines, partially offset by the impact from favorable prior year premium adjustments. Last year, the segment was impacted by four points of adverse development, primarily within our property product lines including three points of adverse development related to losses attributed to COVID-19. We continue to make progress towards our combined ratio target of 90%. Excluding cat and specific events, year-to-date, we're sitting at a 91% versus 93% a year ago. Significant efforts made by Jed Rhoads and our reinsurance team around re-underwriting a reinsurance portfolio are starting to show through in the financial results. As we announced last quarter, Jed is going to be retiring at the end of the year after an incredible 40-plus years in the reinsurance industry. We thank him for all of his contributions to Markel, including successfully repositioning our global reinsurance operations for sustainable, profitable growth. Next, I'll touch on our program services and other funding operations in our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Our program services and other funding operations continue to grow with total premium production of $2.6 billion this year versus $2.3 billion last year and produced total revenues of $105 million this year, up 18% from a year ago. Margins in this area of our business remain strong, as does our new business pipeline. Within our Nephila operations, operating revenue from the year were down versus last year due primarily to the disposition of our Velocity MGA operations in February. We recognized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter of this year associated with that transaction. Further, we finalized the sale of our Volante MGA in October for an estimated cash consideration of $155 million, the gain from which will be recognized in our fourth quarter results. Nephila's assets under management were $7.8 billion as of September 30, 2022. While Hurricane Ian had a significant impact on investor returns, we invested the estimated losses were consistent with Nephila's expectations for an event of this magnitude. Nevertheless, the significant Ian loss and investor fatigue around recent cat activity will continue to adversely impact assets under management. I'll end with a few comments about market conditions and outlook as we look to finish the year strong. As I think everyone knows, we are currently transitioning leadership of our insurance engine over to Jeremy Noble. And he and I will be happy to take questions during Q&A. As I noted earlier and as noted on many of our peers' earnings calls, rates continue to gradually moderate in most lines. Exceptions continue to be cat exposed property in lines such as aviation, terrorism, war and political violence, which has been impacted by the Ukraine war and other large events, including Hurricane Ian. We continue to see strong submissions, new business opportunities and total premium writings despite uncertain financial markets and fears related to a potential economic slowdown. Inflation in all its forms continues to be a significant focus for us and the industry. As I discussed last quarter, going into '22, we had already baked more inflation into our pricing and loss reserving. During the third quarter, we adopted an even more cautious approach, which impacted both our prior accident year reserve releases and our current accident year loss picks. As has always been our philosophy, we will respond quickly to potential adverse trends and will be slow to recognize positive trends until they can be confirmed. Most of our products pricing bases are impacted by inflation, and this helps to some extent to offset claims trend. However, we are not prepared to rely on this to maintain rate adequacy. While overall market conditions remain favorable, we have been disappointed to see more price competition in certain lines of business. We see absolutely no justification for price decreases given all the risk factors we have previously discussed. We are going to continue to push for what we believe are must-have rate increases and we are prepared to walk away from business that is not adequately priced. Fortunately, we feel we're well positioned to both act with discipline and grow profitably given our broad product diversification and market-leading capabilities. Interestingly, we find ourselves at the end of the third quarter this year in a remarkably similar position to 2021. We need a strong finish to the year to achieve our profitability goals of a 90% combined ratio or better. We know our team will continue to work hard in pursuit of this goal. Thank you for your time today. And now I'd like to turn it back over to Tom. Yes. I'll just add a -- just real quickly, Mark, I'll just add. It's been a while since anybody has seen inflationary pressures like the ones we've seen recently. And so, we're having to kind of reeducate underwriters, actuaries, accountants, everybody. I mean, Tom and I have seen this kind of inflation, but a lot of the rest of the people around here have not. So, it's safety first at Markel, and it always has been that way in terms of the reserves. And we'll -- we're more than happy to make sure the reserves are at the confidence level that we want. And if that means there's potentially some reserve decreases down the road, that's great. But I think that's how we're trying to view this current situation. I think it's hard to say whether things -- accident market -- margins improve because we got a lot of unknown variables, right? We don't know what the rate increases are going to be next year, and we also don't know what the true rate of inflation is. I know you're going to hate this answer, but the true thing that we need to be able to start potentially reducing our loss picks and increasing prior year releases is time. We need to see it. So I think it's just a matter -- it's going to be a matter of time. And given current risk factors, I think it will take more time. I guess I'd have to say, John, I don't know. The fourth quarter is usually when you look hard at the side pockets and see if they can be released and that releases trapped fees. I don't know where that will stand this year just simply because of -- like you say, Ian, I think there's going to be quite a bit of focus on making sure you get reserves correct for Ian also in terms of this is the cap time that you do capital raising. So I guess, sorry, the answer is I don't know."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. We often talk of win-win wins and of the importance of being an organization for which others are better off for being associated with. It's events like Ian that remind us of this virtue and where we must follow through. I'm incredibly proud of our associates who are tirelessly supporting our customers and the local communities that have been impacted. Whether we look to our settling of claims to get people back on their feet with the supply of building materials to help restore, Markel is actively working to improve the situation, and our thoughts continue to be with people of Florida at this time. We remain pleased with the strong performance of our insurance and Markel Ventures operations. We are confident in the quality and durability of our investment portfolio as we as well as our ability to execute against our operating plans within our Insurance and Ventures businesses. We continue to find opportunities to allocate capital across our three engines, and we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value. Overall, it's been a pretty solid first three quarters of the year. Looking first to our underwriting results, gross written premiums surpassed $7.5 billion for the first nine months of 2022 compared to $6.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 19%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, strong policy retention levels, more favorable rates and expanded product offerings. Our professional liability and general liability product lines continue to lead the way, but we also achieved meaningful growth across many of our other product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio was 91 for the first nine months of both 2022 and 2021. Our 2022 combined ratio included $70 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian, and $35 million attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which combined added two points to the year-to-date combined ratio. All losses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were recognized in the first quarter and our initial estimates associated with this event remain unchanged. In 2021, we incurred $182 million or four points of net losses from natural catastrophes in the first nine months. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of the year was an 89% compared to 87% for the same period one. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $204 million in the first nine months of this year compared to $366 million in the first nine months of last year. In 2022, among the reasons we experienced lower favorable development was due to greater-than-anticipated claims settlements and increased claims frequency and severity trends in certain of our professional liability product lines within our Insurance segment. The impact of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims, particularly on our longer tail product lines such as professional liability and general liability. As a result, we are approaching reductions in prior year loss reserves cautiously, particularly on more recent accident years. As I've stated last quarter and consistent with our reserving philosophy, we are responding quickly to increased loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. In instances where claims trends are more favorable than we previously anticipated, we're often waiting to reduce our loss reserves, and we'll evaluate our experience over additional periods of time. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income were $2.2 billion in the first nine months of the year were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the period. This compares to net investment gains of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of last year, attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance. We continue to maintain our investing discipline, understanding the periodic cost and the equity markets are to be expected and will result in the variability and timing of the investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of September, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $3.9 billion. With regards to net investment income, we reported $274 million in the first nine months of this year compared to $284 million in the same period last year. The decrease reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments this year compared to income from equity method investments last year. Net investment income on our fixed maturity securities this year was up slightly compared to last year. The impact of higher average holdings and fixed maturity securities this -- in the current year was mostly offset by lower yield compared to the same period a year ago. We're beginning to see the benefit of higher interest rates on our net investment income through recent purchases of higher-yielding fixed maturity securities. That impact will become more meaningful in future periods as lower-yielding securities mature and continue to be replaced with higher-yielding securities. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases began to exceed the average book yield of our portfolio. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $1.3 billion net of taxes during the first nine months of this year, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. As a reminder, we typically hold our fixed maturities until immature. We generally expect these unrealized losses to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our portfolio has an average rating of AAA and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 31% to $3.5 billion for the first nine months of 2022 compared to $2.7 billion for the same period last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont, and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as organic growth across many of our other businesses, most notably in our Construction Services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $353 million for the first nine months of this year compared to $304 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results across several businesses as well as the contribution of Metromont. Looking at our consolidated results for the first nine months of this year. Our year-to-date results demonstrate how well our core operations are navigating the current economic environment and executing at a high level. We reported a net loss to common shareholders of $922 million for the first nine months of this year compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.5 billion for the same period a year ago. This was largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for the first nine months was $2.2 billion compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $1.3 billion in the first nine months of last year. Again, this was driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. It's worth highlighting that given the magnitude of our equity portfolio, we believe generally accepted accounting principles, which require that we include unrealized gains and losses on equity securities in net income, create volatility in revenues and net income, which can obscure the strong operating performance of our businesses. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.9 billion in the first nine months of this year compared to $1.6 billion in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2022 reflected strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders' equity stood at $12.3 billion at the end of September compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. Again, this decline is driven by declines in both the fixed maturity and public equity valuations, as I previously discussed. July 1, we retired $315 million to 4.9% unsecured senior notes. And during the first nine months of 2022, we repurchased 163,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance business. Mark, it's Jeremy. Maybe I'll start on that. I think you're right to point out, and there's property is certainly part of the story. I think marine and aviation lines because of this year's events are also part of the story. So, we see it if we're on the table relative to our outworks programs, and we see where we're at the table from our inwards programs. The conversations are definitely a little more intense. And I think capacity is a little more scarce, and I think that is creating a little bit of a firming opportunity. So I would anticipate that, that has broader implications across casualty and specialty lines as well. So, we're going to see you learn a lot more, I think, in the next few months. But we've seen a little bit of a gap differential over the last couple of years between house where the primary insurance base is working in the reinsurance space. And I would say it's certainly hardening more right now in the reinsurance space. And Mark, maybe, Jeremy, I'll add to that. I mean I think this is a demonstration of the work that we've been hard at across our insurance operations for quite some time. So I think we benefit from broad product diversification, global capabilities, strong trading relationships, a multi-distribution platform. We are achieving rate. We got new product innovation. So that's allowing us to grow, but what we're laser focused on is growing profitably. So at the same time, I think we have the ability to act with a high degree of discipline. That squares comments about the importance around rate adequacy, the importance of discipline and the importance of knowing when we got to push away from the table or put the bend down with the opportunity for us to grow at present as well as what I think that portends for future quarters. And that's what we've been hard at work at. Mark, it's Jeremy. Well, you make a great account. So yes, you're exactly right. It's really just geography. So, that is a straight pass-through any. We continue to wind down the reserves. We continue to execute computations where we can, where there are savings that passes through to the benefit of the original investors. We see that the sort of the benefit come through as favorable in the other expenses. The offset is a non-controlling interest kind of below the line. Just be aware of that. Yes, Mark, I'll start and maybe Rich will jump in. I think that is a good way to think and won't necessarily get into numbers or certainly a line by line of view. But overall, I think we feel that rate and underwriting actions are keeping just ahead of trend. And that expands to our acknowledgment that in an inflationary environment, exposure has an effect of acting like rate to a certain degree as well. So, that is why we are incredibly focused on rate adequacy. If we were in an elevated inflationary environment, without a doubt, the results would even be stronger. I think you know us well and Richie touched upon this earlier, we have a very long-standing philosophy with regards to how to approach reserves, focused on more likely redundant than deficient, focused on reacting to bad news, if you will, very quickly and taking a much more measured view to good news.  That's anywhere over time where we are in a cycle, but I think that's even more so the case now. So feel like despite a patio environment, right, we can take those actions that Richie and I were mentioning. We can still generate favorable prior year development. We can, in fact, maintain or improve our confidence in our loss reserves, and we can still generate certainly on an ex-cat basis, a combined 90 year but that's a pretty good place, I think, for us to be at this stage. John, it's Jeremy. Just to piggyback, John, here just to piggyback off Tom's comments. All of our equity method investments are included in that line item. So it's not just Hagerty. So, I want to make that point. And then Tom is exactly right. The year-over-year shift is $50 million. So instead of on a nine-month basis being down $10 million, we'll be up $40 million. Yes. Exactly. Yes."

This is Tom Gayner and I'm pleased to welcome you to the Markel Corporation's second quarter 2022 conference call. I'm joined this morning as usual by my co-CEO, Richie Whitt who will update you on our insurance engine and our CFO, Jeremy Noble, who will speak to the overall financial results at Markel. We are pleased with our ongoing economic performance. The first half results in our insurance and ventures engines show continued growth in revenues and earnings. The investment results require a little bit more analysis and thought to see the progress we're making, but I'm pleased with our results and our process. I'll speak more specifically about investments and ventures after Ritchie in a few minutes. We always look forward to sharing our results with you.

We thank you for your steadfast support of this journey. As the old saying goes Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is Marcel. The people who built Rome worked every day and so do we. This call is our 90-day update on this lifelong project and we look forward to your thoughtful questions and comments. With that I'll turn things over to Jeremy to share our financial results.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. As Tom's comments suggest, the first half of 2022 continues to highlight the benefits that come from our diversified three-engine architecture here at Markel. While growth in our insurance and Markel Ventures operations drove meaningful contributions to our operating results, the volatility within the public equity markets and the effects of rising interest rates on our bond portfolio significantly impacted our investment results this year. Looking first at our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $5 billion for the first half of 2022 compared to $4.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 18%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume more favorable rates and expanded product offerings and was achieved across many of our product lines. The most notable growth came from our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2022 and 2021 was in 90 [ph]. The 2022 combined ratio included $35 million or 1 point of net loss and loss adjustment expenses and $12.3 million of ceded reinstatement premiums attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. All of this was recognized in the first quarter and our initial estimates associated with this event remain unchanged. This compares to $68 million or two points of losses attributable to Winter Storm Uri and $19 million of adverse development arising from a change in our estimate of COVID-19 ultimate losses included in our 2021 combined ratio. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2022 was an 89% compared to 88% for the same period in 2021. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves with our insurance segment this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio and lower attritional loss ratio within our insurance segment.  Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $123 million in the first half of 2022 compared to $226 million in the first half of 2021. In 2022, we experienced adverse development on certain professional liability product lines, primarily arising from unfavorable claims settlement and increased claims frequency. Additionally, for both our professional liability and general liability product lines the impact of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on these long-tail product lines. As a result, we are approaching reductions to prior year's loss reserves cautiously. In general, on long-tail lines we are responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. Whereas in instances where claims are trending more favorable than we previously anticipated, we will often wait to reduce our loss reserves until we have sufficient confidence that such reductions are warranted. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income of $1.9 billion in the first half of 2022. This was primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the period. This compares to net investment gains of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021 attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before we focus on long-term performance. We continue to maintain our investing discipline understanding the periodic declines in the equity markets are to be expected and will result in variability in the timing of investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regards to net investment income, we reported $166 million in the first half of '22 compared to $193 million in the same period last year. The decrease reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments this year compared to income on equity method investments last year. Net investment income our fixed maturity securities in 2022 was consistent with last year. The impact of higher average holdings of fixed maturity securities this year was largely offset by lower yield compared to the same period a year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases of fixed maturity securities began to exceed the average book yield on our portfolio. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $837 million net of taxes during the first half of 2022. This reflects the decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from increases in interest rates during the first half of 2022. As a reminder, we tend to hold substantially all of our fixed maturities until they mature and our portfolio has an average rating of AAA. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 30% to $2.3 billion in the first half of 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in the same period last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses. Most notably, at tour construction services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $250 million for the first half of this year, compared to $220 million for the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our Construction Services and Consulting Services businesses, as well as a contribution of Metromont.  Looking at our consolidated results for the first half of the year, we reported a net loss to common shareholders of $987 million for the first half of the year, compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.3 billion in the same period a year ago. This was largely attributed to year-over-year swing in changes in the public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss for shareholders for the first half 2022 was $1.8 billion, compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021, again this was driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. Finally, I will make some few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $921 million for the first half of 2022 compared to $813 million in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2022 strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders equity stayed at $12.8 billion at the end of June compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. And this decline is driven by the clients in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as I\u2019ve previously discussed. On July 1st we retired $350 million of 4.9% unsecured senior notes, which we pre-funded and held in trust at the end of June. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased 96,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, which was just under $670 million remained at the end of June. Overall, we're pleased with the solid performance delivered by our insurance at Markel Ventures operations as we weather the impact of volatility in the public equity and bond markets. We are confident in the quality and durability of our investment portfolio and on our ability to execute against our operating plans within our insurance and Ventures businesses. We remain focused on building long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. As Jeremy said, I'll be discussing our insurance engine second quarter and year-to-date results. At the halfway point of the year, we are in a position to attain our 2022 goals for both production volume and profitability. Business production continues to be strong. We achieved 18% growth in our underwriting operations with total gross written premiums surpassing $5 billion for the first half of the year. Within our program services and funding operations, we also had continued growth and are seeing expanding opportunities. While we're still benefiting from a generally overall favorable premium rate environment, we have been seeing for the past few quarters some tempering rate increases across certain product classes compared to a year ago. In addition to rate increases, our production growth has been significantly influenced by new business growth, development of new products and the onboarding of new program relationships, all while maintaining our focus on underwriting discipline. Our first half combined ratio of 90% is consistent with our 2022 underwriting profitability targets.  Hit our overall target, despite a decrease in our prior accident year loss takedowns in the first half of the year. We are cautiously and consistently applying our conservative reserving philosophy, as we and the entire insurance industry contend with the potential economic impacts of various forms of inflation. Our focus on expense discipline, while we scale our operations, continues to benefit our expense ratio with our first half expense ratio hitting 33%, a 2-point improvement from a year ago. Now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, program services and fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. So, getting started with the insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the insurance segment were up 21% for the first half of the year with just over $4 billion in premium writings, while earned premiums were up 20% for the first half of the year. We continue to realize double-digit growth rates across most of our major product lines in particular, within our professional liability, general liability and programs product lines within both our US and international operations. The combined ratio for the first half of the year in the insurance segment was 88 compared to 87 for the first half of last year. Current year combined ratio included $20 million or 1 point of net losses related to the Russia Ukraine war versus $43 million or 2 points of net losses last year related to winter storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio increased by 2 points, due to less favorable development on prior accident year losses partially offset by a lower current accident year attritional loss ratio and lower expense ratio. The 2022 current accident year attritional loss ratio decreased by 2 points spread across several product lines, but most notably in our general liability and professional liability lines due to the impact from favorable premium rates and our expanded premium writings in deferred product classes. The lower 2022 favorable development on prior accident year's losses was driven by adverse development in our professional liability lines, primarily in airs and emissions and financial institutions classes on accident years 2015 to 2019. Notably, these years were the bottom of the soft market, along with lower takedowns in our general liability book.  Due to the uncertain impacts from economic and social inflation, along with the potential delays in the litigation process with contested claims, we are taking a cautious approach to realizing prior accident year loss takedowns. In particular, within our longer tail general liability products where claims are developing in line with expectations, but where claims develop slowly. Higher earned premiums while maintaining a consistent overall direct and controllable expense spend for the first half of the year. had a favorable impact on their expense ratio, driving it down by two points versus the prior year. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. Gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment were up 7% for the first half of the year, while earned premiums were up 6%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, from both new business, and higher renewals due in part to more favorable rates along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments in our general liability and credit and surety lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers' compensation lines. Our property lines continue to run off as part of the transition of our Reinsurance property line to our Nephila ILS operations and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. The reduction in workers' compensation was due to the non-renewal of a large quota share treaty in the first quarter of 2022. Combined ratio for the first half of the year within the Reinsurance segment was 97% compared to 105% a year ago. These current year combined ratio included $15 million or three points of net losses from the Russia-Ukraine war compared to $25 million or five points of net losses last year related to winter storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased by six points from a year ago, primarily due to lower adverse development on prior accident year losses. Segment had three points of adverse loss development this year, driven by the impact of favorable prior year premium adjustments, offset in part by favorable loss development in our credit and surety property product lines. Last year, the segment was impacted by 10 points of adverse development, primarily within our property product lines, including four points of development related to losses attributed to COVID-19. Our ex-cat and specific events combined ratio of 94% within our Reinsurance segment for the first half of the year continues to move towards our goal of achieving a 90% or better combined ratio within the segment. We remain positive about our current portfolio and the business written in the most recent underwriting years, but with predominantly long tail portfolio, it's going to take time to prove that. Next, I'll touch on program services and other fronting operations and our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services and other funding operations is ceded. Our program services and other funding operations continue to grow with total premium production of $1.6 billion this year versus $1.4 billion last year and produced total revenues of $64 million this year, up 14% from a year ago. Margins in this area of the business remain very strong as does the new business pipeline. Our insurance-linked securities operations consist entirely of the Nephila operations. Operation -- operating revenues for the year were down versus the prior year due primarily to the disposition of Nephila Velocity MGA operations in February of this year. As a reminder, we recognized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter this year associated with this transaction. Post the sale, Velocity continues to partner with and produce significant premiums in support of the Nephila fund management operations, and we retain a minority interest in Velocity. Nephila assets under management within its fund management operations were $8.5 billion, as of June 30. I'll finish up with a few comments about market conditions and outlook for the second half of the year. As discussed earlier, rates continue to gradually moderate in most lines. Exceptions would be cat exposed property in lines such as aviation, terrorism, war and political violence, which have been impacted by the Russia, Ukraine war and other recent large events. Pleasingly, submissions, new business opportunities and total premium writings continue to be very strong. Inflation in all its forms continues to be a significant focus for us and the entire industry. As I discussed last quarter, going into 2022, we had already baked more inflation into our pricing and loss reserving. As we enter the second half of the year with continued signs of inflation, we have adopted an even more cautious approach. As has always been our philosophy, we will respond quickly to potential adverse trends and are going to be slow to recognize positive trends until they can be confirmed. Most of our products pricing bases are impacted by inflation, and this helps to some extent to offset claims trend. However, we are not prepared to rely on this to maintain rate adequacy. We are going to continue to push for what we believe are must-have rate increases. We believe we are going to have success pushing for these rate increases as all responsible and disciplined insurance market participants must pursue rate increases to stay ahead of claims inflation. Given everything that is happening right now, I now believe that favorable market conditions will continue through the second half of the year and in 2023. But we have entered without a question, a more nuanced phase of the current market cycle. We see overall market conditions as presenting opportunities, and we believe we're well positioned to execute in the second half of the year and beyond. Thanks for your time today and turn it over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie, and good morning. For those of you who are on the phone, we have the call that's proceeding as designed to do. We're getting reports that there are problems with the webcast -- we're looking into that, and we are proceeding to get this taped and recorded, and we will do our best to make sure that indeed took place and give a broadcast out as soon as we put Humpty Dumpty back together on that. So with that, Markel Ventures, let me shift back to the planned program. Markel Ventures produced record revenues of $2.3 billion, up from $1.8 billion and, more importantly, record EBITDA of $250 million, compared to $220 million last year. As you all know, we operate a diverse set of businesses that operate in many different industries. The diversification adds to the resilience and long-term success of Markel. I am very proud of our operators who continue to run the Markel Ventures companies, amidst the challenges of continued supply chain tangles, inflation, labor shortages and endless complexity. Every single item on that list is real, and I suspect that will continue to be the case for the indefinite future. I think their performance in the face of these unrelenting challenges speaks volumes about their talent and dedication. No one knew three years ago what it would be like to run a business through wave after wave of disruptions in every aspect of life. Despite the lack of for knowledge and a proven playbook, I can report to you that your team continues to find ways to serve their customers and their associates and report record financial results. I could not be more proud of them. While we always have some businesses with headwinds and some with tailwinds, I find the ongoing results produced by the Markel Ventures companies to be extremely gratifying. These results continue to validate and demonstrate the value of our decentralized and autonomous approach. We work hard to find the best people and businesses we can, and let them build their companies for the long-term. Over the last several years, I've spoken repeatedly about the high prices in the marketplace for businesses like those that comprise Markel Ventures. I've said that we might not be able to find great acquisitions in this environment, and yet we've been able to consistently add to the roster of Markel Ventures in recent years. I'll reiterate my comment about how hard it is to find acquisitions right now, but I will report to you that several of our companies are working on adding to their businesses from their base of knowledge of people and opportunities that they know. It's a great thing for Markel that people already on our team, proven winners who have deep industry expertise, can find and welcome additional people and businesses to the family. I'm excited about our ability to continue to grow and extend our Markel Ventures companies in a disciplined and economically fruitful way. Our culture and lengthening track record continue to spark conversations that should serve us well. On our investment engine, we reported losses during the first half of 2022. Jeremy, gave you the numbers, but I think it's worth the effort to unpack them just today. On the front of the income statement, we reported net investment losses of $1.9 billion through the first half of 2022, compared to a gain of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021. Both of those numbers are largely unrealized and just displayed the normal volatility we expect from both equity and fixed income markets. Even after the first half drama, of the worst first half for the S&P 500 -- 50 years, we still have an unrealized gain on our equity portfolio of $4.2 billion. While that gain is down from $6.2 billion at year-end 2021, I think it's fair to say that our long-term track record of earning excellent returns in our equity portfolio remains true. The rebound in equity markets in July might foreshadow the other part of what the word volatility means when we trail out the third quarter results. We'll see. Our first half negative return of 20.6% trailed the S&P 500 return of 20%, negative 20% by a smidge. Our returns compare very favorably to the NASDAQ 100 Index first half return of negative 29.2%, and our 30-plus year record continues to be excellent. As one additional point of reference, we talk a lot about long-term around Markel. Specifically, we often use a five-year time frame to measure ourselves, as well as calculated incentive compensation. Five years ago, the unrealized gain in the equity portfolio was $2.7 billion. Today, as we stated, it stands at $4.2 billion, even after the worst first half start for equity markets in 50 years. To add on here two other data points from the 2017 second quarter 10-Q. Our earned premium back then was a little over $2 billion during the first half of 2017 compared to $3.6 billion in the first half of 2022. We also reported revenues of $638 million in Markel Ventures in 2017 compared to the $2.6 billion we just reported for the first half of 2022. As the great philosopher, Sheryl Crow said, \u201cEveryday is a winding road\u201d. She's right, the road winds. But that Markel it seems to lead up and to the right over time. Equally, if not more important, the difference between realized and unrealized gains and losses often seems to get muddled with the way GAAP accounting works these days. The vast, vast majority of our reported gains in 2021 and reported losses in 2022 were unrealized. We don't uncork champagne when the numbers are extraordinarily good, as they were in 2021, nor do we despair the negative results of 2022. Another way of thinking about the distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses is to think about which of our equity holdings have hope compared to those that are hopeless. I remain hopeful about our high-quality portfolio of companies earning good returns on capital, run by managers with equal measures of talent and integrity, with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline at fair prices. We don't always get our analysis right, but we do always think about every equity we buy and own using this four-part test. We've consistently followed this time-tested method for decades. I think that the drop experienced in the first half of 2022 revealed that many companies should be deemed to be relatively helpless. The money is gone. Some high client stocks that wouldn't be categorized as meeting our four-part test came crashing back down to earth, and I wouldn't hold out too much hope, they'll make it back into orbit. We do not own any securities in that category. I categorize our portfolio as a part of congealed hope and not hot mess of hopelessness. I like our hand. In fact, we are not selling the high-quality equity securities, we're buying. When you put it all together, the market downturn we've experienced so far in 2022 brings a good economic opportunity for markdown. This is precisely the sort of environment where our three engine architecture really shines. Our insurance engine continues to produce solid profitability and cash. Our Ventures engine continues to produce solid profitability and cash. Also, our recurring stream of dividends and interest income actually increased to $198 million compared to $188 million a year ago. You can find those details in footnote 4D in the 10-Q if you'd like to tie out those numbers. Rising interest rates may cause an unrealized mark-to-market loss in our bond portfolio. That is simply a matter of math and timing. It will reverse flow following the same map and passage of time. There are no credit losses in the portfolio. The loss will amortize back to even as each bond matures. As to recurring interest income from our bond portfolio, rising interest rates, coupled with ongoing investment of the cash flows produced by our businesses are starting to power rising investment income. The yield on new bond purchases exceeds the yield on matured bonds now. It has been years since we've seen that fact. Similarly, our dividend income continues to grow driven by the combination of companies we own increasing their dividends and are continuing purchases of more equity securities. The combined thrust of our three engines powered our allocation of capital during the first half of 2022. We purchased roughly $200 million of additional equity securities. We also repurchased roughly $125 million of Markel common stock and we repaid $350 million of long-term debt. To summarize, I'm pleased with our recent results. We're enjoying excellent results in our insurance and ventures engines and I think we're creating solid results in our investment engine even though it might not look that way at the moment. Our three engines are producing cash and capital. We're combining those cash flows with courage and conviction by investing in all aspects of our business in ways to continue to build the growing value of the Markel Corporation. Thank you again for your ongoing support and commitment. We cannot build this company without you and we appreciate you. Now we welcome the chance to answer your questions. And with that I'll turn it back over to Andrea and hope we're still connected. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. Good morning \nRichie Whitt: Good morning\u2026\nMark Hughes: You're loud and clear on my end, but I dialed in. Your concern about inflation, I wonder if you could -- I think you've kind of touched on this, but I'd be interested if you could expand on it. How much is based on increasing costs that you're actually seeing within your own book or whether it's kind of broader inflationary pressures that are driving it, or whether there are kind of specific categories that you think might impact you overtime that you're focused on that are influencing your more conservative posture here? \nRichie Whitt: Mark, I'll take a shot at this. But I'll throw it open to the table here to see how I do. Yes. I mean we are concerned -- I mean the CPI inflation is one thing and we saw the 9.1% or whatever it was in this most recent month. And that clearly has an impact. The other thing that we have a close eye on and they're starting to become evidence of is the social inflation aspect which really, really addresses probably more of the severity aspect.  We're watching both and coming into the year, we were thinking hard about both and we sort of baked more inflation into our claims trend, depending on the line of business. We're doubling down on -- I don't know if we're doubling down on that but we are definitely going to be even more conservative as we go through the rest of the year, just given the signs that we're seeing out in the macro environment. We are probably on average and it depends by line but we're probably on average 6% plus in terms of what we're thinking in terms of trend right now. We haven't really seen current agent years misbehaving. The development that we saw in professional liability in particular E&O and financial institutions that was sort of in the trough of the soft market years the 15 to 19 years. But everything trends forward and so we have to keep an eye on the more current years and we're just going to be more conservative as we approach those years until we have a better sense of things. \nTom Gayner: And Mark this is Tom. I think to some degree part of your question would reflect is right how much you've seen in actual bills that you're paying in claims today versus what are you putting up there and factors for what we expect to happen in the future? And the answer is it's mix, but we would quantify it. But I think Rich's point and this is the kind of thing that we have communication with our frontline underwriters about all the time. Why are rate increases necessary when we've had these rate increases and our current bills perhaps don't show that quite so much. It's our job senior managers see round the corner a little bit and what we're communicating and working with our frontline underwriters with is look the storm is coming. So, just to make sure we get ahead of it rather than to try to catch up with it after the storm is already there. So, I don't have a quantification for how much is the current year bill versus what we paring to be cautious for going forward, but rest assured it's both. And that's on the insurance side. On the venture side the feedback loops are different. So, we do see current data of what a ton of steel cost is what an hourly wage rate is and we need to make sure that we work hard to preserve the margins to make sure we can continue to serve our customers. Because the whole point of the way this worked is we try to make our customers happy and we try to be there for them the day after that the day after that and the year after that. And in order to do that we need to run a profitable business. So, the timing and feedback loops are different in the insurance business compared to the pension businesses. But the point is this is a top of the page topic on both sides of the house.\nMark Hughes: Understood. Thanks for that. Can you talk about the rates continuing to gradually moderate in this environment. At the same time submissions new business still up strongly. What drives that? Should -- is that a little bit of a -- should those things be moving in tandem, or why is submission growth being pretty strong even as rates are moderating? \nRichie Whitt: Yes. It's -- I'll be honest it's a little surprising to me, particularly with signs now that the economy is starting to slow down a little bit given what's been happening with rates and the actions I look at it this way. We grew at roughly 20% in the first half of the year. We have the flexibility to -- and we'll be talking -- we are talking to our underwriters about this. 20% that's great, but 15% and getting rate increases is better. And so we're in an enviable position at the moment in that we are growing and we're going to be talking and are talking to our underwriters about really let's talk about rate adequacy rate margin in areas where we have solid rate adequacy and solid rate margin. Let's look to grow in areas where we believe that's getting closer to the sort of Mendoza line, we're going to be cutting back. I said it's a more nuanced part of the market and hard markets you're all out writing. That's not the market we're in now. We're going to be looking at rate adequacy at a very granular level. We'll continue to push forward in areas where we think that's attractive and in areas where we think it's getting too close we're going to be pulling back.\nMark Hughes: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Mark Dwelle of RBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Yes. Good morning. A few questions. Maybe first kind of building I guess on the last question kind of just talking about some of the nuance in the pricing environment. If the pricing is slowing, are you seeing that as an indicator that pricing has reached a degree of adequacy on a fairly broad basis, or is it that there are beginning to be competitors who are becoming more aggressive in trying to capture share or capture new volumes? \nRichie Whitt: Yes. I think you got to look at it line by line Mark. As I said, there's lines where there's clearly rate adequacy. And yes, certainly there's competition coming in and starting to compete away some of that adequacy, not all lines got to the same level of rate adequacy. If you look at things like commercial auto I would question if it ever got to rate adequacy. So it is going to be a line-by-line sort of analysis. And there's no question just the fact that rates were going up has brought people back into the market either making the assumptions or believing that there's rate adequacy where they're trying to compete. And I would say in some areas yes, there's certainly solid rate adequacy there in other areas. I don't see it and don't understand why people would be increasing competition in those areas. \nMark Dwelle: In Professional Liability where you added a little bit to reserves? Is that a line where rates are still below adequacy or the reserve add was more a byproduct of loss trend accelerating faster than you might have expected? \nRichie Whitt: The years that we saw the development were really the bottom of the soft market and financial institutions was one of the areas we mentioned. I don't know what the cumulative rate change would be on financial institutions from that point in time but it's significant. And I do think financial institutions and there's various classes even within financial institutions. I do believe for the most part that has gotten to rate adequacy. And so I'm not as concerned about the more current accident years but we are going to be watching carefully if rates come off in those areas. D&O. D&O was sort of the poster child for rates going up and rates are starting to soften there and come off in some places. We're going to be extremely careful in D&O to make sure we don't go below rate adequacy on that portfolio.\nMark Dwelle: That's helpful color. I appreciate that. The second question is during the quarter you engaged in some share buybacks. It's not that you've never done those before but it's definitely a little bit less common appearance. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about buybacks, kind of, what prompts you to get into the market? What prompts you to hang back really just a refresher because it's not something that we've seen real lately?\nTom Gayner: Sure. Mark this is Tom. And you're correct. The pace and amount of share repurchasing, we're doing is more than we've ever done at Markel before. And I'll talk -- again as you say refresh or the capital allocation triage and philosophy here is the first thing we want to do is invest in organic opportunities in the businesses we're already in. If we've got an insurance opportunity or ventures opportunity where we're already there and there's the opportunity to invest capital and grow good returns with proven winners inside the tent. We're going to do that first. The second thing we would look to do is acquisitions of additional ventures or insurance companies. Third thing we would do is to purchase public equity securities. And the fourth thing that we would do is when we look at all those opportunities and Markel stock meets that test of business producing good returns on capital run by management's equal measures of talent and integrity with capital discipline at a fair price, and Markel stock comes up meeting all those four things, we're going to do that too. And we can do all four of those things at the same time. We do them one, two, three, four, but it might be the circumstance where all four are happening simultaneously. And I would say we're in one of those environments right now. So we're just trying to be rational and make rational decisions and what a rational decision leads me to at the moment is to say, we are buying some Markel stock. So we did.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful on that. And then one last question. This is I guess particularly for you Tom, and it could well be that the answer will be very similar to what you just said. But you commented for several quarters that the pricing is very high to do acquisitions in the ventures realm. I know you've never sold a ventures unit. But should you consider being a seller? You've had many of these businesses for quite a long time. You bought them well. They've ripened nicely. Is there a time to harvest? Is there any -- is there ever a time to harvest? Maybe you can just talk about how you think about those?\nTom Gayner: Sure. The great news is harvest happens every day in the ongoing operations of the business and the cash flows they produce. So we're not buying things to turn around and sell them. We're buying things to operate them and build them and see them grow and produce more cash and that's indeed what they're doing. We do not sell the business and we don't look to, because we think one of the features of culture and ethos that we have. And one of the reasons why people want to join Markel is because they share the dream of building something wonderful for a long period of time as well not just trying to ring a bell and then everybody leaves and starts over somewhere else. The building of Markel is meant to be a generational thing, generation after generation. It's been three generations already. We're working on generation 4.0. We look forward 5.0 and 6.0 and that doesn't involve selling, because harvesting doesn't need to happen from selling harvesting happens from running a good business every day and putting the cash in the store house and then applying that cash to further growth opportunities.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That's helpful. That\u2019s all my question. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks. \nTom Gayner: Well, thank you very much. We appreciate you sticking with us through the technical difficulties of the webcast. We'll try to figure out what happened there and get that out in a replay fashion and look forward to connecting with you soon. Thank you so much. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you, Andrew. This is Tom Gayner and I'm pleased to welcome you to the Markel Corporation's second quarter 2022 conference call. I'm joined this morning as usual by my co-CEO, Richie Whitt who will update you on our insurance engine and our CFO, Jeremy Noble, who will speak to the overall financial results at Markel. We are pleased with our ongoing economic performance. The first half results in our insurance and ventures engines show continued growth in revenues and earnings. The investment results require a little bit more analysis and thought to see the progress we're making, but I'm pleased with our results and our process. I'll speak more specifically about investments and ventures after Ritchie in a few minutes. We always look forward to sharing our results with you. We continue to focus on building the long-term value of Markel in multiple dimensions. We continue to operate with the win, win, win focus where our customers are better off for having dealt with us. Our associates along with their families and communities are better off for being part of us and our shareholders earn excellent returns on the capital needed to run this business. While these quarterly updates occur every 90 days, we think and act with a much longer time frame. We think about years and decades and generations rather than quarters and we hope you share our long-term goals of building one of the world's great companies. We thank you for your steadfast support of this journey. As the old saying goes Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is Marcel. The people who built Rome worked every day and so do we. This call is our 90-day update on this lifelong project and we look forward to your thoughtful questions and comments. With that I'll turn things over to Jeremy to share our financial results. Thank you, Richie, and good morning. For those of you who are on the phone, we have the call that's proceeding as designed to do. We're getting reports that there are problems with the webcast -- we're looking into that, and we are proceeding to get this taped and recorded, and we will do our best to make sure that indeed took place and give a broadcast out as soon as we put Humpty Dumpty back together on that.

That is simply a matter of math and timing. It will reverse flow following the same map and passage of time. There are no credit losses in the portfolio. The loss will amortize back to even as each bond matures. As to recurring interest income from our bond portfolio, rising interest rates, coupled with ongoing investment of the cash flows produced by our businesses are starting to power rising investment income. The yield on new bond purchases exceeds the yield on matured bonds now. It has been years since we've seen that fact. Similarly, our dividend income continues to grow driven by the combination of companies we own increasing their dividends and are continuing purchases of more equity securities. The combined thrust of our three engines powered our allocation of capital during the first half of 2022. We purchased roughly $200 million of additional equity securities. We also repurchased roughly $125 million of Markel common stock and we repaid $350 million of long-term debt. To summarize, I'm pleased with our recent results. We're enjoying excellent results in our insurance and ventures engines and I think we're creating solid results in our investment engine even though it might not look that way at the moment. Our three engines are producing cash and capital. We're combining those cash flows with courage and conviction by investing in all aspects of our business in ways to continue to build the growing value of the Markel Corporation. Thank you again for your ongoing support and commitment. We cannot build this company without you and we appreciate you. Now we welcome the chance to answer your questions. And with that I'll turn it back over to Andrea and hope we're still connected. And Mark this is Tom. I think to some degree part of your question would reflect is right how much you've seen in actual bills that you're paying in claims today versus what are you putting up there and factors for what we expect to happen in the future? And the answer is it's mix, but we would quantify it. But I think Rich's point and this is the kind of thing that we have communication with our frontline underwriters about all the time. Why are rate increases necessary when we've had these rate increases and our current bills perhaps don't show that quite so much. It's our job senior managers see round the corner a little bit and what we're communicating and working with our frontline underwriters with is look the storm is coming. So, just to make sure we get ahead of it rather than to try to catch up with it after the storm is already there. So, I don't have a quantification for how much is the current year bill versus what we paring to be cautious for going forward, but rest assured it's both. And that's on the insurance side. On the venture side the feedback loops are different. So, we do see current data of what a ton of steel cost is what an hourly wage rate is and we need to make sure that we work hard to preserve the margins to make sure we can continue to serve our customers. Because the whole point of the way this worked is we try to make our customers happy and we try to be there for them the day after that the day after that and the year after that. And in order to do that we need to run a profitable business. So, the timing and feedback loops are different in the insurance business compared to the pension businesses. But the point is this is a top of the page topic on both sides of the house. Sure. Mark this is Tom. And you're correct. The pace and amount of share repurchasing, we're doing is more than we've ever done at Markel before. And I'll talk -- again as you say refresh or the capital allocation triage and philosophy here is the first thing we want to do is invest in organic opportunities in the businesses we're already in. If we've got an insurance opportunity or ventures opportunity where we're already there and there's the opportunity to invest capital and grow good returns with proven winners inside the tent. We're going to do that first. The second thing we would look to do is acquisitions of additional ventures or insurance companies. Third thing we would do is to purchase public equity securities. And the fourth thing that we would do is when we look at all those opportunities and Markel stock meets that test of business producing good returns on capital run by management's equal measures of talent and integrity with capital discipline at a fair price, and Markel stock comes up meeting all those four things, we're going to do that too. And we can do all four of those things at the same time. We do them one, two, three, four, but it might be the circumstance where all four are happening simultaneously. And I would say we're in one of those environments right now. So we're just trying to be rational and make rational decisions and what a rational decision leads me to at the moment is to say, we are buying some Markel stock. So we did. Sure. The great news is harvest happens every day in the ongoing operations of the business and the cash flows they produce. So we're not buying things to turn around and sell them. We're buying things to operate them and build them and see them grow and produce more cash and that's indeed what they're doing. We do not sell the business and we don't look to, because we think one of the features of culture and ethos that we have. And one of the reasons why people want to join Markel is because they share the dream of building something wonderful for a long period of time as well not just trying to ring a bell and then everybody leaves and starts over somewhere else. The building of Markel is meant to be a generational thing, generation after generation. It's been three generations already. We're working on generation 4.0. We look forward 5.0 and 6.0 and that doesn't involve selling, because harvesting doesn't need to happen from selling harvesting happens from running a good business every day and putting the cash in the store house and then applying that cash to further growth opportunities. Well, thank you very much. We appreciate you sticking with us through the technical difficulties of the webcast. We'll try to figure out what happened there and get that out in a replay fashion and look forward to connecting with you soon. Thank you so much. Goodbye."

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. As Jeremy said, I'll be discussing our insurance engine second quarter and year-to-date results. At the halfway point of the year, we are in a position to attain our 2022 goals for both production volume and profitability. Business production continues to be strong. We achieved 18% growth in our underwriting operations with total gross written premiums surpassing $5 billion for the first half of the year. Within our program services and funding operations, we also had continued growth and are seeing expanding opportunities. While we're still benefiting from a generally overall favorable premium rate environment, we have been seeing for the past few quarters some tempering rate increases across certain product classes compared to a year ago. In addition to rate increases, our production growth has been significantly influenced by new business growth, development of new products and the onboarding of new program relationships, all while maintaining our focus on underwriting discipline. Our first half combined ratio of 90% is consistent with our 2022 underwriting profitability targets.  Hit our overall target, despite a decrease in our prior accident year loss takedowns in the first half of the year. We are cautiously and consistently applying our conservative reserving philosophy, as we and the entire insurance industry contend with the potential economic impacts of various forms of inflation. Our focus on expense discipline, while we scale our operations, continues to benefit our expense ratio with our first half expense ratio hitting 33%, a 2-point improvement from a year ago. Now I'll discuss our year-to-date results within our insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, program services and fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. So, getting started with the insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the insurance segment were up 21% for the first half of the year with just over $4 billion in premium writings, while earned premiums were up 20% for the first half of the year. We continue to realize double-digit growth rates across most of our major product lines in particular, within our professional liability, general liability and programs product lines within both our US and international operations. The combined ratio for the first half of the year in the insurance segment was 88 compared to 87 for the first half of last year. Current year combined ratio included $20 million or 1 point of net losses related to the Russia Ukraine war versus $43 million or 2 points of net losses last year related to winter storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these event losses, the combined ratio increased by 2 points, due to less favorable development on prior accident year losses partially offset by a lower current accident year attritional loss ratio and lower expense ratio. The 2022 current accident year attritional loss ratio decreased by 2 points spread across several product lines, but most notably in our general liability and professional liability lines due to the impact from favorable premium rates and our expanded premium writings in deferred product classes. The lower 2022 favorable development on prior accident year's losses was driven by adverse development in our professional liability lines, primarily in airs and emissions and financial institutions classes on accident years 2015 to 2019. Notably, these years were the bottom of the soft market, along with lower takedowns in our general liability book.  Due to the uncertain impacts from economic and social inflation, along with the potential delays in the litigation process with contested claims, we are taking a cautious approach to realizing prior accident year loss takedowns. In particular, within our longer tail general liability products where claims are developing in line with expectations, but where claims develop slowly. Higher earned premiums while maintaining a consistent overall direct and controllable expense spend for the first half of the year. had a favorable impact on their expense ratio, driving it down by two points versus the prior year. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. Gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment were up 7% for the first half of the year, while earned premiums were up 6%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, from both new business, and higher renewals due in part to more favorable rates along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments in our general liability and credit and surety lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers' compensation lines. Our property lines continue to run off as part of the transition of our Reinsurance property line to our Nephila ILS operations and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. The reduction in workers' compensation was due to the non-renewal of a large quota share treaty in the first quarter of 2022. Combined ratio for the first half of the year within the Reinsurance segment was 97% compared to 105% a year ago. These current year combined ratio included $15 million or three points of net losses from the Russia-Ukraine war compared to $25 million or five points of net losses last year related to winter storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased by six points from a year ago, primarily due to lower adverse development on prior accident year losses. Segment had three points of adverse loss development this year, driven by the impact of favorable prior year premium adjustments, offset in part by favorable loss development in our credit and surety property product lines. Last year, the segment was impacted by 10 points of adverse development, primarily within our property product lines, including four points of development related to losses attributed to COVID-19. Our ex-cat and specific events combined ratio of 94% within our Reinsurance segment for the first half of the year continues to move towards our goal of achieving a 90% or better combined ratio within the segment. We remain positive about our current portfolio and the business written in the most recent underwriting years, but with predominantly long tail portfolio, it's going to take time to prove that. Next, I'll touch on program services and other fronting operations and our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium within our program services and other funding operations is ceded. Our program services and other funding operations continue to grow with total premium production of $1.6 billion this year versus $1.4 billion last year and produced total revenues of $64 million this year, up 14% from a year ago. Margins in this area of the business remain very strong as does the new business pipeline. Our insurance-linked securities operations consist entirely of the Nephila operations. Operation -- operating revenues for the year were down versus the prior year due primarily to the disposition of Nephila Velocity MGA operations in February of this year. As a reminder, we recognized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter this year associated with this transaction. Post the sale, Velocity continues to partner with and produce significant premiums in support of the Nephila fund management operations, and we retain a minority interest in Velocity. Nephila assets under management within its fund management operations were $8.5 billion, as of June 30. I'll finish up with a few comments about market conditions and outlook for the second half of the year. As discussed earlier, rates continue to gradually moderate in most lines. Exceptions would be cat exposed property in lines such as aviation, terrorism, war and political violence, which have been impacted by the Russia, Ukraine war and other recent large events. Pleasingly, submissions, new business opportunities and total premium writings continue to be very strong. Inflation in all its forms continues to be a significant focus for us and the entire industry. As I discussed last quarter, going into 2022, we had already baked more inflation into our pricing and loss reserving. As we enter the second half of the year with continued signs of inflation, we have adopted an even more cautious approach. As has always been our philosophy, we will respond quickly to potential adverse trends and are going to be slow to recognize positive trends until they can be confirmed. Most of our products pricing bases are impacted by inflation, and this helps to some extent to offset claims trend. However, we are not prepared to rely on this to maintain rate adequacy. We are going to continue to push for what we believe are must-have rate increases. We believe we are going to have success pushing for these rate increases as all responsible and disciplined insurance market participants must pursue rate increases to stay ahead of claims inflation. Given everything that is happening right now, I now believe that favorable market conditions will continue through the second half of the year and in 2023. But we have entered without a question, a more nuanced phase of the current market cycle. We see overall market conditions as presenting opportunities, and we believe we're well positioned to execute in the second half of the year and beyond. Thanks for your time today and turn it over to Tom. Good morning... Mark, I'll take a shot at this. But I'll throw it open to the table here to see how I do. Yes. I mean we are concerned -- I mean the CPI inflation is one thing and we saw the 9.1% or whatever it was in this most recent month. And that clearly has an impact. The other thing that we have a close eye on and they're starting to become evidence of is the social inflation aspect which really, really addresses probably more of the severity aspect.  We're watching both and coming into the year, we were thinking hard about both and we sort of baked more inflation into our claims trend, depending on the line of business. We're doubling down on -- I don't know if we're doubling down on that but we are definitely going to be even more conservative as we go through the rest of the year, just given the signs that we're seeing out in the macro environment. We are probably on average and it depends by line but we're probably on average 6% plus in terms of what we're thinking in terms of trend right now. We haven't really seen current agent years misbehaving. The development that we saw in professional liability in particular E&O and financial institutions that was sort of in the trough of the soft market years the 15 to 19 years. But everything trends forward and so we have to keep an eye on the more current years and we're just going to be more conservative as we approach those years until we have a better sense of things. Yes. It's -- I'll be honest it's a little surprising to me, particularly with signs now that the economy is starting to slow down a little bit given what's been happening with rates and the actions I look at it this way. We grew at roughly 20% in the first half of the year. We have the flexibility to -- and we'll be talking -- we are talking to our underwriters about this. 20% that's great, but 15% and getting rate increases is better. And so we're in an enviable position at the moment in that we are growing and we're going to be talking and are talking to our underwriters about really let's talk about rate adequacy rate margin in areas where we have solid rate adequacy and solid rate margin. Let's look to grow in areas where we believe that's getting closer to the sort of Mendoza line, we're going to be cutting back. I said it's a more nuanced part of the market and hard markets you're all out writing. That's not the market we're in now. We're going to be looking at rate adequacy at a very granular level. We'll continue to push forward in areas where we think that's attractive and in areas where we think it's getting too close we're going to be pulling back. Yes. I think you got to look at it line by line Mark. As I said, there's lines where there's clearly rate adequacy. And yes, certainly there's competition coming in and starting to compete away some of that adequacy, not all lines got to the same level of rate adequacy. If you look at things like commercial auto I would question if it ever got to rate adequacy. So it is going to be a line-by-line sort of analysis. And there's no question just the fact that rates were going up has brought people back into the market either making the assumptions or believing that there's rate adequacy where they're trying to compete. And I would say in some areas yes, there's certainly solid rate adequacy there in other areas. I don't see it and don't understand why people would be increasing competition in those areas. The years that we saw the development were really the bottom of the soft market and financial institutions was one of the areas we mentioned. I don't know what the cumulative rate change would be on financial institutions from that point in time but it's significant. And I do think financial institutions and there's various classes even within financial institutions. I do believe for the most part that has gotten to rate adequacy. And so I'm not as concerned about the more current accident years but we are going to be watching carefully if rates come off in those areas. D&O. D&O was sort of the poster child for rates going up and rates are starting to soften there and come off in some places. We're going to be extremely careful in D&O to make sure we don't go below rate adequacy on that portfolio."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning everyone. As Tom's comments suggest, the first half of 2022 continues to highlight the benefits that come from our diversified three-engine architecture here at Markel. While growth in our insurance and Markel Ventures operations drove meaningful contributions to our operating results, the volatility within the public equity markets and the effects of rising interest rates on our bond portfolio significantly impacted our investment results this year. Looking first at our underwriting results. Gross written premiums were $5 billion for the first half of 2022 compared to $4.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 18%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume more favorable rates and expanded product offerings and was achieved across many of our product lines. The most notable growth came from our professional liability and general liability product lines in both our insurance and reinsurance segments. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2022 and 2021 was in 90 [ph]. The 2022 combined ratio included $35 million or 1 point of net loss and loss adjustment expenses and $12.3 million of ceded reinstatement premiums attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. All of this was recognized in the first quarter and our initial estimates associated with this event remain unchanged. This compares to $68 million or two points of losses attributable to Winter Storm Uri and $19 million of adverse development arising from a change in our estimate of COVID-19 ultimate losses included in our 2021 combined ratio. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2022 was an 89% compared to 88% for the same period in 2021. The increase reflects the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves with our insurance segment this year compared to last year, partially offset by a lower expense ratio and lower attritional loss ratio within our insurance segment.  Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $123 million in the first half of 2022 compared to $226 million in the first half of 2021. In 2022, we experienced adverse development on certain professional liability product lines, primarily arising from unfavorable claims settlement and increased claims frequency. Additionally, for both our professional liability and general liability product lines the impact of economic and social inflation have created more uncertainty around the ultimate losses that will be incurred to settle claims on these long-tail product lines. As a result, we are approaching reductions to prior year's loss reserves cautiously. In general, on long-tail lines we are responding quickly to increase loss reserves following any indication of increased claims frequency or severity in excess of our previous expectations. Whereas in instances where claims are trending more favorable than we previously anticipated, we will often wait to reduce our loss reserves until we have sufficient confidence that such reductions are warranted. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses included in net income of $1.9 billion in the first half of 2022. This was primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by significant declines in the public equity markets during the period. This compares to net investment gains of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021 attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before we focus on long-term performance. We continue to maintain our investing discipline understanding the periodic declines in the equity markets are to be expected and will result in variability in the timing of investment gains and losses. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regards to net investment income, we reported $166 million in the first half of '22 compared to $193 million in the same period last year. The decrease reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments this year compared to income on equity method investments last year. Net investment income our fixed maturity securities in 2022 was consistent with last year. The impact of higher average holdings of fixed maturity securities this year was largely offset by lower yield compared to the same period a year ago. Beginning in the second quarter of this year, the book yield on new purchases of fixed maturity securities began to exceed the average book yield on our portfolio. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $837 million net of taxes during the first half of 2022. This reflects the decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from increases in interest rates during the first half of 2022. As a reminder, we tend to hold substantially all of our fixed maturities until they mature and our portfolio has an average rating of AAA. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 30% to $2.3 billion in the first half of 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in the same period last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses. Most notably, at tour construction services businesses. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $250 million for the first half of this year, compared to $220 million for the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our Construction Services and Consulting Services businesses, as well as a contribution of Metromont.  Looking at our consolidated results for the first half of the year, we reported a net loss to common shareholders of $987 million for the first half of the year, compared to net income to common shareholders of $1.3 billion in the same period a year ago. This was largely attributed to year-over-year swing in changes in the public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive loss for shareholders for the first half 2022 was $1.8 billion, compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $1.2 billion in the first half of 2021, again this was driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. Finally, I will make some few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $921 million for the first half of 2022 compared to $813 million in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2022 strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders equity stayed at $12.8 billion at the end of June compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. And this decline is driven by the clients in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as I've previously discussed. On July 1st we retired $350 million of 4.9% unsecured senior notes, which we pre-funded and held in trust at the end of June. During the first six months of 2022, we repurchased 96,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, which was just under $670 million remained at the end of June. Overall, we're pleased with the solid performance delivered by our insurance at Markel Ventures operations as we weather the impact of volatility in the public equity and bond markets. We are confident in the quality and durability of our investment portfolio and on our ability to execute against our operating plans within our insurance and Ventures businesses. We remain focused on building long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our insurance businesses."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Andrea. Good morning. This is indeed Tom Gayner and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the first quarter Markel Corporation conference call. I am joined today by our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. As always, our objective is to share the news from some of our most recent financial statements, and more importantly, answer any questions you might have about Markel and the circumstances of your company. We always look forward to your thoughtful questions. In addition to this call, we have got two other events coming up that have offered up as chances to spend meaningful time with management. First, this weekend, we will be heading back to Omaha to attend the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting as we have done for decades. We will be hosting our annual Sunday brunch at 10 a.m. at the Marriott next to the convention center and if you can join us, we would love to see you. We take questions for a couple of hours that day and we absolutely love the chance to spend time with fellow long-term investors in Omaha during Berkshire weekend. Second, the Markel Annual Meeting will be at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 11th, at the Virginia Credit Union LIVE! Concert Arena at the Richmond Raceway. We invite you all to attend and we would welcome the chance to spend time with you at our upcoming annual meeting. As to the financial results of the first quarter, I am very pleased with our performance and I hope you share our sense of accomplishment and optimism. The first quarter is a short 90-day view of Markel. We enjoyed three engines of Insurance, Markel Ventures and investments. While it is lovely that all three engines provide positive thrust, Markel is designed to succeed, even if not all three are firing. In one dimension, i.e., that of the last 90 days, you can accurately say that only two of our three engines fired. That is correct. Since in the first quarter we earned excellent returns in our Insurance and ventures operations, but experienced negative mark-to-market swings in our investment portfolio. If I put myself in your shoes as an owner of Markel here what I would expect over time. There should be no surprises to you in our Insurance operations when we report the results of any one quarter. You, as observers of the world can know through regularly reported news whether major loss events like natural catastrophes, pandemics, wars, wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes or other big events took place or not. Given what you already know from general awareness of the news, I suspect you as reasonably informed and thoughtful owners would have some sense of how our Insurance operations might perform. Richard will give you more details in a minute, but I am pleased to be able to report to you that we enjoyed excellent results in our Insurance operations and I don\u2019t think we are reporting anything that should surprise you. Similarly, in our Ventures operations, we have put together a diversified and robust set of businesses that have demonstrated their excellence for many years and through incredibly varied conditions, including the pandemic supply chain issues, inflation, trade tensions, technological change and all of those factors I listed when I was talking about Insurance. I am pleased to report ongoing meaningful growth and profitability for Markel Ventures as we begin 2022. Jeremy will give you the numbers in just a minute. Finally, while the first 90 days saw mark-to-market declines in our publicly traded portfolio of stocks and bonds, I think you as investors would agree that we are likely to regularly experience the most reported volatility with our investment engine as compared to the others. Given that reality, longer term measurements matter way more than those of any given quarter. We regularly measure things in five-year time increments, including how we calculate incentive compensation for senior management and I thought it might be helpful to take a quick glance at what the investment engine produced over the last five years as opposed to the last 90 days. On March 31, 2017, our equity portfolio stood at roughly $5 billion. Five years later, it stands at $8.7 billion, an increase of 74%. On March 31, 2017, our equity portfolio had an unrealized gain of roughly $2.5 billion. Five years later, it stands at $5.8 billion, an increase of 132% over that time. On March 31, 2017, each share of Markel sold for $978. Five years later, each share sold for $1,492, an increase of 53%. Those last five years included the pandemic, wildfires, tsunamis and just about any other challenge you could imagine or even ones you couldn\u2019t imagine. While we necessarily report quarterly financial results as a publicly traded company, we think about and manage Markel over much longer timeframes. Financially, we tie our compensation of senior management to five-year rolling results, and in reality, we think in even longer timeframes, such as decades and generations as we run this business. With that as a preamble, I\u2019d now like to turn things over to Jeremy to provide you with the details from the first quarter.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Tom mentioned, the first quarter of 2022 highlights the benefits that come from our diversified three-engine architecture at Markel. Volatility within the public equity markets and the effects of rising interest rates on our bond portfolio while weighing down our investment returns during the quarter were somewhat mitigated by strong operating results within our Insurance and Markel Ventures operations. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $2.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of 16%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, more favorable rates and expanded product offerings across many of our product lines, with the most notable growth coming from our professional liability and general liability product lines, both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 86% in 2022, which is down 1 point from the same period last year. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2022 was an 89%, which included $35 million or 2 points of net losses in loss adjustment expenses and $12.3 million of ceded reinstatement premiums attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This compares to a 94% combined ratio for the same period last year, which included $64 million or 4 points of losses attributable to Winter Storm Uri and $19 million or 1 point of adverse development arising from a change in our estimate of COVID-19 ultimate losses a year ago. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2022 was an 87%, compared to an 88% for the same period of 2021. This improvement reflects a lower attritional loss ratio within our Insurance segment and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by less favorable development on prior year loss reserves. Higher earned premiums in 2022 compared to 2021 had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior accident year\u2019s loss ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $96 million in the first quarter of this year, compared to $91 million in the first quarter of last year. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses were $358 million in the first quarter of 2022 and were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by unfavorable market value movements. This comparison net investment gains of $527 million in the first quarter of 2021, attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. As I have mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, and we typically measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regards to net investment income, we reported $73 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $97 million in the same period last year. The decrease this quarter reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments in the first quarter of this year, most notably, our investment in Hagerty. Net investment income on our fixed maturities in 2022 was consistent with 2021, as the impact of higher average holdings of fixed maturities in 2022 was largely offset by lower yields compared to the same period a year ago. As a reminder, for accounting purposes, we are deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Hagerty, and, therefore, account for our investment in Hagerty under the equity method rather than a fair value. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Hagerty was $239 million, which was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2022, the estimated value of our investment based on the closing stock price of Hagerty\u2019s Class A common shares was approximately $840 million. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $476 million net of taxes during the first quarter of this year, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates during the first quarter. As a reminder, we tend to hold substantially all of our fixed maturities until they mature. Now, I will cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 35% to $950 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $707 million for the comparable quarter last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses. EBITDA for Market Ventures was $96 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $81 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our Construction Services and Consulting Services businesses, as well as a contribution from Metromont. As a reminder, EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021 included a pretax disposition gain of $22 million in connection with the sale of a portion of one of our healthcare businesses. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27%, which results having a relatively small pretax loss during the period. The estimated annual effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2022. We reported a net loss of common share to common shareholders of $53 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to net income to common shareholders of $574 million in the same period a year ago, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Guidance of loss to shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $529 million, compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $359 million in the first quarter a year ago, again, driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. Finally, I will highlight a few transactions in the period and make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. First, in March of this year, we completed the previously announced buyout transaction related to Markel CATCo, accelerating the return of all remaining trapped capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. Under the terms of the transaction, we provided cash funding of $45 million to purchase substantially all of Markel capital funds\u2019 investments in Markel CATCo Re, which at present we anticipate being returned to us in time as remaining trust fund collateral is released. We also made $102 million in additional payments net of Insurance proceeds to or for the benefit of investors in exchange for releases of all claims related to the transaction, the CATCo businesses and investors\u2019 investments in the funds including any pending litigation, which was recognized as an expense during the first quarter of 2022. We expect that the remaining runoff of CATCo will have minimal effect on our future results. Second, within our Nephila ILS operations, there were two transactions worth touching upon. In February 2022, we sold the majority of our controlling interest in our Velocity Managing General Agent operations for total cash consideration $181 million, which resulted in a gain of $107 million. We continue to have a minority interest in Velocity after the sale and Velocity will continue to be a source of risk origination for our Nephila fund management operations. In March 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our controlling interest in our Volante Managing General Agent operations. This transaction is expected to close later this year in the third quarter and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Following the disposition of Nephila-Volante operations, our Nephila ILS operations will be solely comprised of its core fund management operations. Turning to cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $415 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $318 million for the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2022 reflected strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $14.1 billion at the end of March, compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 63,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. All-in-all, we are pleased with the start to the year, particularly with the strong results in our Insurance and Markel Ventures operations. We remain committed to building shareholder value over time. We believe we continue to advance this effort in the first quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance businesses.\nRichie Whitt: Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. I am excited today to discuss with you our Insurance engine\u2019s first quarter results. Obviously, it\u2019s only 90 days into the year, but we are off to a strong start to the year. Many of the trends that we discussed throughout last year continued in the first quarter. The pricing environment continues to hold up well and organic growth remains strong. As Jeremy said, we achieved an 89% combined ratio for the period despite 2 points of losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Business production continues to be robust, with 16% growth in our underwriting operations, with gross written premium surpassing $2.5 billion for the quarter and that that\u2019s the first time we have done that and 17% growth within our program services operations. While we continue to benefit from a favorable pricing environment, we are also seeing new business growth across most of our product lines, in particular within our professional and general liability products. As Jeremy mentioned, we also had an active quarter in the ILS space, completing the sale of our majority interest in the Velocity MGA operations and announcing the sale of our Volante MGA operations, which we expect to close some time later this year. Both of these transactions unlock significant value from our Nephila acquisition in 2018 and also allowed Nephila to devote full attention to the opportunities they see in the cat arena right now. Now I will discuss our first quarter results within our Insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, state and national program services operations, and Nephila Insurance-linked securities operations. So I will kick it off with the Insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the Insurance segment were up 19% in the quarter, with just under $2 billion in premium ridings, while earned premiums were up 16% for the period. We saw double-digit growth rates across all of our major product lines, in particular within the professional liability and general liability product lines, where we have identified new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations, and have benefited from new program opportunities. We continue to benefit from favorable rating environment within most of our Insurance product lines, although rate increases achieved continue to gradually moderate. The combined ratio for the quarter in the Insurance segment was 87%, compared to 91% last year. The current year combined ratio included $20 million or 1 point of net losses related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict versus $39 million or 3 points of net losses last year related to Winter Storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these events, the combined ratio decreased by just over 1 point due to a 2-point decrease in our attritional loss ratio across several product lines, reflecting the impact from rising rates and our ability to write more premium in our preferred product classes. This was partially offset by a decrease in favorable development from prior accident year\u2019s losses in the quarter. Higher earned premiums have a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior accident year\u2019s loss ratio. So next I will talk about the Reinsurance segment. Gross written premium within the Reinsurance segment were up 8% for the quarter, while earned premiums were up 12%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, from both, new business and higher renewals, due in part to more favorable rates, along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments within our credit and surety, professional liability and general liability product lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers\u2019 compensation lines. Our property lines continue to run off as part of our exit strategy with the transition of our Reinsurance property lines to Nephila and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. As of the end of the first quarter, in terms of Reinsurance property, we are fully off risk at this point. The reduction in worker\u2019s compensation was due to the non-renewal of one large quota share treaty. The combined ratio for the period within the Reinsurance segment was 95%, compared to 109% a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $15 million or 5 points of net losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared to $25 million or 10 points of losses last year related to Winter Storm Uri. Last year, the segment was also impacted by adverse development of $19 million related to losses from COVID-19. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased 2 points due to lower adverse development on prior accident years\u2019 losses, partially offset by a slightly higher current accident year attritional loss ratio. The segment had adverse -- had modest adverse loss development this quarter, driven entirely by the impact from favorable prior year premium adjustments, offset in part by favorable loss development in our property product lines. The current accident year attritional loss ratio increased due to mix of business since our discontinued property lines carried a lower attritional loss ratio, partially offset by decreases this year in attritional loss ratio within our general liability and general liability lines. Next, I will touch on program services and other fronting operations and our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. So as a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium from our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Our program services and other fronting operations continue their strong performance with program services producing $706 million in premiums during the period and total revenues from funding operations of $34 million with continued strong profit margins. Our ILS operations consist entirely of Nephila operations going forward. Operating revenues were flat to last year with higher revenues at our Volante MGA operations, offset by lower revenues at the Velocity MGA operations due to the sale of that unit in February. While Velocity will continue to partner with and produce significant premiums in support of Nephila funds, post-sale, the MGA\u2019s commission revenues obviously will no longer be included in Nephila\u2019s results. Nephila\u2019s assets under management within the fund management operations were $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2022. I will finish up with a few comments about market conditions and obviously happy to answer any questions during Q&A. As I said earlier in my comments, trends continue largely in line with what we discussed at year end. Rates have held up well and organic growth has remained solid. Rate increases continue to gradually moderate, but have held up better than we would have predicted a quarter or two ago. I believe that uncertainty around inflation, both economic and social, financial market volatility, including interest rate increases, recession concerns and the Russian-Ukraine conflict, have all played some role in supporting continued underwriting discipline in the market. There continues to be much discussion in the industry around inflation and its impact on claims cost. As you would expect, I think, we are baking more claims inflation into both our pricing and reserving and believe rate increases remain ahead of claims inflation. We will be watching each of our over 100 specialty lines very closely, and we will adjust underwriting and pricing strategies as needed to maintain profitability. Bottomline, we are right where we want to be at the end of the first quarter and I got to tell you, that feels great considering where we stood at the end of the first quarter in 2020 with COVID-19 and at the end of the first quarter in 2021 with Winter Storm Uri. Even better however, we are really excited about the opportunities for the rest of the year. Thanks for your time today and now I will turn things over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Richie. The people of Markel Ventures continue to make me grateful and amazed. Their absolute dedication to the -- to their customers and to their colleagues continues to show up month-after-month, quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. Today\u2019s numbers that Jeremy shared speaks volumes as to how the human values of Markel continue to manifest themselves in our financial results. The current environment remains challenging in finding people and supplies, but our managers continue to demonstrate their resilience and creativity. I find their results to be inspiring. On the acquisition front and adding new businesses to Markel Ventures, we continue to see elevated prices as a general statement. As such, I would not expect to add a new platform to Markel Ventures this year. For reference, I felt the same thing during the first quarter of the last several years. Despite that, attractive situations came up and we added wonderful businesses in each of the last several years. We will see how 2022 develops. Our managers and CEOs running the Markel Ventures businesses also continue to pursue opportunities to add to our existing businesses and I would expect some fruitful developments as a consequence. Also, fortunately, our existing array of businesses continue to perform well, generate cash, grow, and provide resilience and diversification to Markel. In our investment operations, the change in the value of our fixed income portfolio was due entirely to the increase in the overall level of interest rates. There were no credit losses in the portfolio and that continues a multiyear record of pristine results from fixed income. Reinvestment rates on maturities and in current cash flows continue to increase and that should yield increases in recurring investment income in upcoming quarters. We generally hold our fixed income securities to maturity and unrealized gains or losses, all tend to revert back to zero in the fullness of time. In our equity portfolio, our ratio of publicly-traded equities to our shareholders equity stood at 61% at the end of the first quarter. That\u2019s a conservative ratio. Given our Insurance profitability, capital position, ventures profitability, durability of recurring investment income and attractive purchase prices, we are continuing to buy common stocks and repurchase our own stock. We are also ready, willing and able to consider attractive acquisitions in the Insurance or ventures worlds. I\u2019d like to thank you again for your ongoing commitment to Markel. We can\u2019t build one of the world\u2019s great companies without fellow long-term owners who have the same goal. We believe that our win, win, win architecture of serving our customers and our fellow employees creates wonderful returns for our shareholders as well. We are delighted to connect with you to update you following these first quarter results and we look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming events shortly. With that, Andrea, if you would be so kind as to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJeff Schmitt: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could you talk about the loss environment, what do you see loss costs trends running at? And then any detail that you could provide on maybe the components, how much is related to social inflation versus CPI inflation? And I know social inflation can be tough to sort of isolate, but just curious, had CPI inflation sort of taken over or is that additive on loss cost, how are they running now?\nRichie Whitt: Jeff, this is Richie. I will take a shot and I will see if Jeremy or Tom want to add in. I think you got to start with recognizing that you are not seeing much in terms of the data at this point. When we talk to our claims folks, they are really not seeing a whole lot of claims inflation showing up in our numbers yet. However, we know with all the things that are going on out in the environment, both CPI inflation, litigation, finance, toward the erosion of tort reform over the years. We know that claims inflation is running higher than it historically has. I can\u2019t give you a precise number, and obviously, we write, as I said earlier, on the order of 100 different lines of business and so it would be different in each of those lines of business. But I do think it\u2019s more than what we have historically seen. But I still believe, when you look at the rate increases that we are still achieving, we are in the high-single digits in terms of rate increases. I still believe there\u2019s a margin on that versus what claims inflation is running at right now.\nJeff Schmitt: Got it. Got it. Okay. And then, on the competitive environment, obviously, it\u2019s holding up really well. I guess are you surprised that it\u2019s this disciplined after price, call three years rate [ph] increases, some people got in 30-plus percent cumulative rate increase. They are still holding up. I understand the cost pressures, whether it\u2019s been tough, interest rates are low. But are you surprised, are you starting to see some competitors start to get more aggressive on price, on terms and conditions, are you seeing any indication of that or is it staying pretty rational?\nRichie Whitt: I would say it is staying pretty rational. But, yes, I mean, clearly, we are seeing more competition as the rate of increase has decelerated. So I think some of the new entrants, both company and MGA, I think, they have had some impact on the margin. I do think, after three years and in some cases four years of rate increases, people\u2019s assessment of rate adequacy changes and so their appetite changes. So this market -- the cycle is no different than past cycles. We are probably past the peak of this cycle. But it is coming off very gradually and I think, I said in my comments, probably more gradually than I would have predicted a few quarters ago and I think it\u2019s some of the things that have been developing, the war, inflation, interest rates, you name it. I think there\u2019s enough things out there that give people pause and so it\u2019s been a very gradual gentle glide on the rates as opposed to maybe something faster that I might have predicted a few quarters ago.\nJeff Schmitt: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. If I could just one last one on the fixed income securities, I just wonder if you could discuss your philosophy there. They are all -- they are held as available to sale. You are saying you hold to maturity anyway, though. I am just wondering if there\u2019s any contemplating -- any changes with that strategy in this rising interest rate environment. I mean, can you switch those to hold the maturity and not have the mark-to-market changes or what are your thoughts on that?\nTom Gayner: Well, it\u2019s like Abraham Lincoln once said, how many legs does the dog have if you call a tail a leg? The answer is four. So calling the tail a leg doesn\u2019t make it a leg, whether the accounting terms are available for sale or held to maturity, whichever one you use, the mark-to-market value is a real economic number that\u2019s out there. We think about things in real economic terms. So we really don\u2019t expect to have any changes in what we are doing or the way that we label the accounting. Now there\u2019s another sort of accounting nuance that\u2019s very important to remember is that. The philosophy on fixed income is that we buy fixed income to match against the reserves of what we expect to pay out in claims and expenses of running the business. And the reason we buy fixed income securities that have a duration of between four years and five years is, because that matches the duration of what we expect to pay out the claims over. So when interest rates rise and you see a mark-to-market decrease in the fixed income portfolio, if you were really doing the net present value of the reserves, you would see an equal and offsetting reduction in the amount of the reserves. Now as an accounting matter, we don\u2019t discount our reserves to their net present value. So economically what we are doing is we are hedging and matching and saying straight up either way because one of the things that we fully believe is that we have no idea how to predict accurately what interest rates are going to do. So either way, whether they go up or whether they go down, we are hedged, we are matched. We are making a spread of return between the positive yields on a bond portfolio and the negative cost of flow that we get through underwriting profitability, and as long as we keep that spread positive number, things add up to the good over time.\nJeff Schmitt: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the answers.\nRichie Whitt: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning.\nTom Gayner: Good morning, Mark.\nMark Hughes: The cat losses were pretty low in the quarter, couldn\u2019t get much lower. How much -- other than the Russia-Ukraine, but how much is that your underwriting versus the backdrop, just a more favorable cat backdrop in 1Q? And any thoughts on kind of implications when we think about future trajectory on cat losses, is it signaling something important to us?\nRichie Whitt: It was a relatively light first quarter in terms of cat, Mark, excluding Russia-Ukraine. And so, I would say, it\u2019s a combination. I would say it was a relatively light first quarter in terms of where we write cat exposed business. But also, I mean, I think, it is showing up the fact that we have been derisking in terms of cat over the last several years. And so, whereas we would have budgeted probably 3 or so points of cat losses the last year or two, our budget for cat losses in 2022, I think, is around 1%. Is that right, Jeremy? So, it\u2019s a combination of both, a relatively light first quarter and the fact that we have been diligently working to reduce cat exposure in the portfolio. So, that\u2019s that.\nJeremy Noble: And Mark, it\u2019s Jeremy. I\u2019d like to just add one other point. We typically only call out large, significant named events\u2026\nRichie Whitt: Yes.\nJeremy Noble: \u2026 within our cat. So we don\u2019t tend to sort of get all of that sort of cat activity and disclose that when they are smaller amounts. So there\u2019s always a little bit of, if you will, almost like attritional cat. We sort of embed in our underlying results. But then to Richie\u2019s point, our modeled average annual losses have come down significantly in recent years, as we have addressed reducing the volatility in our book associated with catastrophes.\nMark Hughes: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then on the expense ratio, any one-time benefits in the quarter or is that just efficiency and leverage?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. It\u2019s more -- it\u2019s Jeremy again. It\u2019s more efficiency and leverage, right? We continue to enjoy growth -- significant growth on the topline and we are able to sort of not see the direct and controllable expenses on that base grow at the same rate. So we continue to benefit in that, that way. So nothing significant besides that, I would really call out.\nMark Hughes: Yeah. No. I think you have touched on this, but kind of your latest thoughts around the workers\u2019 comp market. You renewed a treaty, I think, in the Reinsurance book. How are you looking at that business both on the primary and Reinsurance?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. That\u2019s the market -- that is the one part of the market that has resisted hardening and rates have continued to gently drift down, yeah, 2% to 3%. As a result, I mean, we still think there\u2019s margin in the primary side of the business and so we continue to write business there, but we recognize that the margin is smaller in workers\u2019 comp right now. When we got to looking at that Reinsurance deal and with the cumulative rate decreases that have happened over the last few years, we didn\u2019t believe it stacked up and so we stepped away.\nMark Hughes: When you say the margin is smaller, are you saying -- are you thinking relative to other lines that you are writing your preferred categories or are you talking about relative to what you might have written in comp last year or the year before?\nJeremy Noble: Right. Relative to workers\u2019 comp, over the last few years. Workers\u2019 comp has been a great line of business for several years now, which that helps explain why people have been competitive in it. There have been good results. But I just wouldn\u2019t expect the kinds of results we have had -- we have enjoyed in workers\u2019 comp over the last several years, in the next few years, unless something changes in terms of the pricing dynamic.\nMark Hughes: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Mark Dwelle of RBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Dwelle: Yeah. Good morning. A few questions. First maybe for, Jeremy, on the Hagerty mark-to-market, I guess, for the equity investment accounting. Is there a way that you can help us understand, like, kind of how to track that number? I mean, I knew that Hagerty shares had declined in the quarter and so I expected there would be some adjustment for that? But the amount that you adjusted by was different in both percentage terms, and obviously, in dollar terms than what the stock price performance was. So is there a way that we can kind of think about that or get our arms around it?\nJeremy Noble: Sure. Mark, it\u2019s Jeremy. I will take a stab at that and Richie or Tom can join in as well. With regards to where we provide what the approximation to the fair value might be based on the traded A shares, you can rough think of Markel having about 23% ownership in Hagerty. And so just think of that in terms of their sort of market capitalization at a certain point in time. That\u2019s a little bit of that fair value proxy. As far as what\u2019s recorded in our books, it\u2019s more a function of us taking our proportionate share of Hagerty\u2019s underlying earnings and any other capital sort of transactions. We do have to record that, however, on a quarter lag, because obviously Hagerty is a publicly traded company. We don\u2019t have access to the information on top. It\u2019s not significant period-over-period. So, just thinking of the relationship between the two figures that we report on and a little bit of how to think about that that sort of fair value proxy that we put in.\nTom Gayner: It\u2019s probably worth talking about the warrants and how they impact.\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. Sure. So one of the things that will create a little bit of underlying volatility with regards to our held to what we hold on the actual Markel balance sheet and other assets. We will see a little bit of volatility relative to the mark-to-market that Hagerty has relative to their warrants. So if you think of the warrant activity because of the move in the Hagerty stock price through the end of the year that creates sort of a liability and an expense that we reflected it as part of the reduction we would have seen at 03/31 versus 12/31. So that creates a little bit more volatility. As a kind of more of a one-off, they also in either year-end results would have had the transaction costs associated with going public. But that\u2019s really a one-time event.\nMark Dwelle: So the primary thing that we are picking up there is their earnings results. It\u2019s not really the movement in the stock price that\u2026\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. What -- yeah. What we hold on the balance sheet is just a function of their underlying -- our proportionate share of their underlying earnings and any other capital transactions. But it\u2019s not the movement in the fair value of their stock.\nMark Dwelle: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, this one is maybe for Tom or Jeremy. Could you just provide -- you talked already at length about kind of how you think about your investment portfolio and duration matching and so forth. Could you just provide a couple of maybe general statistics in terms of what the portfolio duration is right now, kind of what the book yield is and where new money yields are relative to that?\nTom Gayner: Yeah. I don\u2019t have precise numbers at my fingertips, but it would -- the duration would be roughly four and a quarter four and a third, something like that. The new money rates are a little bit higher than what the existing yields are. So when we are investing new money, we are at the point of over the last couple of months with rates having gone up, that the new money investment rates are higher than the embedded yield.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s fine. And then the other question I had. Obviously, you have sold the Volante and Velocity over the last couple of quarters here. Could you just talk about strategically why it\u2019s better to be out of those as compared to retaining them? They really -- I mean, they don\u2019t have a lot of capital associated with them and they seem to make money. So, I guess, the question would be why not keep them as compared to realize a little bit of cash flow at the moment?\nTom Gayner: Sure. Mark, well, both of those organizations were acquired obviously as part of the Nephila acquisition and they were investments, quite honestly, that Nephila had made in those two operations. We have looked at it two ways. In both cases, management had ownership, had partial ownership of those businesses. And so they had an interest in realizing the value of those organizations at some point. And that had been sort of memorialized through the deals that Nephila put together with management in both cases. So we wanted to be fair to the management of those two operations and allowed them to realize the part of the value that they had created there. Obviously, we were able to unlock significant value for Nephila and Markel Corporation. And honestly, great businesses, great people, but there is quite a bit of time that is spent in terms of managing those operations that now we can fully devote to the core business, which is, fund management for cap risk and climate risk and we think the opportunity right now in the cat arena is significant. And so all of those things play into it, but really just getting super focused on our core business is probably the driver.\nMark Dwelle: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, one last question, if I may. In terms of the Russia and Ukraine exposures, I mean, you had reasonably good disclosure of that in the Q. But could you just talk about in terms of how many -- it will probably be in fairly broad terms. I mean, do you have considerable more exposure that could arise there or have you already been impacted on most of the accounts or transactions that you would expect to be impacted or just -- I am trying to get a sense of like how much of this is the tip of the iceberg and how much of it is the whole iceberg?\nTom Gayner: To be just blunt, Mark, very -- we have very little information at this point coming out of the conflict. Obviously, as we all know, the war is still ongoing, and so it\u2019s not like you are able to send adjusters in and see what the status is on the ground. So we tried to make a good faith estimate of what could potentially be our exposure. I would tell you what we have put up, it is 100% IBNR at this point and really sort of thinking about what our net retentions could be and how our Reinsurance worked. Trying to put up something that we felt like was a very best estimate of what could happen, obviously the longer it goes on, both from a humanitarian standpoint and just economic damages standpoint, things get worse. But we do not write that much business in Ukraine or in Russia for that matter, timing in respects to our overall book of business. But, obviously, when you start adding up policy limits, you can get to some big numbers. But we really don\u2019t believe it is a material issue to Markel Corporation. But, again, the longer it goes, the worse it gets from a humanitarian situation, as well as an economic situation.\nMark Dwelle: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. That\u2019s all my questions.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much. We enjoyed being with you. We hope to see you either in Omaha or Richmond soon. Be well.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. Good morning. This is indeed Tom Gayner and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the first quarter Markel Corporation conference call. I am joined today by our Co-CEO, Richie Whitt; and our CFO, Jeremy Noble. As always, our objective is to share the news from some of our most recent financial statements, and more importantly, answer any questions you might have about Markel and the circumstances of your company. We always look forward to your thoughtful questions. In addition to this call, we have got two other events coming up that have offered up as chances to spend meaningful time with management. First, this weekend, we will be heading back to Omaha to attend the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting as we have done for decades. We will be hosting our annual Sunday brunch at 10 a.m. at the Marriott next to the convention center and if you can join us, we would love to see you. We take questions for a couple of hours that day and we absolutely love the chance to spend time with fellow long-term investors in Omaha during Berkshire weekend. Second, the Markel Annual Meeting will be at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 11th, at the Virginia Credit Union LIVE! Concert Arena at the Richmond Raceway. We invite you all to attend and we would welcome the chance to spend time with you at our upcoming annual meeting. As to the financial results of the first quarter, I am very pleased with our performance and I hope you share our sense of accomplishment and optimism. The first quarter is a short 90-day view of Markel. We enjoyed three engines of Insurance, Markel Ventures and investments. While it is lovely that all three engines provide positive thrust, Markel is designed to succeed, even if not all three are firing. In one dimension, i.e., that of the last 90 days, you can accurately say that only two of our three engines fired. That is correct. Since in the first quarter we earned excellent returns in our Insurance and ventures operations, but experienced negative mark-to-market swings in our investment portfolio. If I put myself in your shoes as an owner of Markel here what I would expect over time. There should be no surprises to you in our Insurance operations when we report the results of any one quarter. You, as observers of the world can know through regularly reported news whether major loss events like natural catastrophes, pandemics, wars, wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes or other big events took place or not. Given what you already know from general awareness of the news, I suspect you as reasonably informed and thoughtful owners would have some sense of how our Insurance operations might perform. Richard will give you more details in a minute, but I am pleased to be able to report to you that we enjoyed excellent results in our Insurance operations and I don't think we are reporting anything that should surprise you. Similarly, in our Ventures operations, we have put together a diversified and robust set of businesses that have demonstrated their excellence for many years and through incredibly varied conditions, including the pandemic supply chain issues, inflation, trade tensions, technological change and all of those factors I listed when I was talking about Insurance. I am pleased to report ongoing meaningful growth and profitability for Markel Ventures as we begin 2022. Jeremy will give you the numbers in just a minute. Finally, while the first 90 days saw mark-to-market declines in our publicly traded portfolio of stocks and bonds, I think you as investors would agree that we are likely to regularly experience the most reported volatility with our investment engine as compared to the others. Given that reality, longer term measurements matter way more than those of any given quarter. We regularly measure things in five-year time increments, including how we calculate incentive compensation for senior management and I thought it might be helpful to take a quick glance at what the investment engine produced over the last five years as opposed to the last 90 days. On March 31, 2017, our equity portfolio stood at roughly $5 billion. Five years later, it stands at $8.7 billion, an increase of 74%. On March 31, 2017, our equity portfolio had an unrealized gain of roughly $2.5 billion. Five years later, it stands at $5.8 billion, an increase of 132% over that time. On March 31, 2017, each share of Markel sold for $978. Five years later, each share sold for $1,492, an increase of 53%. Those last five years included the pandemic, wildfires, tsunamis and just about any other challenge you could imagine or even ones you couldn't imagine. While we necessarily report quarterly financial results as a publicly traded company, we think about and manage Markel over much longer timeframes. Financially, we tie our compensation of senior management to five-year rolling results, and in reality, we think in even longer timeframes, such as decades and generations as we run this business. With that as a preamble, I'd now like to turn things over to Jeremy to provide you with the details from the first quarter. Thank you, Richie. The people of Markel Ventures continue to make me grateful and amazed. Their absolute dedication to the -- to their customers and to their colleagues continues to show up month-after-month, quarter-after-quarter and year-after-year. Today's numbers that Jeremy shared speaks volumes as to how the human values of Markel continue to manifest themselves in our financial results. The current environment remains challenging in finding people and supplies, but our managers continue to demonstrate their resilience and creativity. I find their results to be inspiring. On the acquisition front and adding new businesses to Markel Ventures, we continue to see elevated prices as a general statement. As such, I would not expect to add a new platform to Markel Ventures this year. For reference, I felt the same thing during the first quarter of the last several years. Despite that, attractive situations came up and we added wonderful businesses in each of the last several years. We will see how 2022 develops. Our managers and CEOs running the Markel Ventures businesses also continue to pursue opportunities to add to our existing businesses and I would expect some fruitful developments as a consequence. Also, fortunately, our existing array of businesses continue to perform well, generate cash, grow, and provide resilience and diversification to Markel. In our investment operations, the change in the value of our fixed income portfolio was due entirely to the increase in the overall level of interest rates. There were no credit losses in the portfolio and that continues a multiyear record of pristine results from fixed income. Reinvestment rates on maturities and in current cash flows continue to increase and that should yield increases in recurring investment income in upcoming quarters. We generally hold our fixed income securities to maturity and unrealized gains or losses, all tend to revert back to zero in the fullness of time. In our equity portfolio, our ratio of publicly-traded equities to our shareholders equity stood at 61% at the end of the first quarter. That's a conservative ratio. Given our Insurance profitability, capital position, ventures profitability, durability of recurring investment income and attractive purchase prices, we are continuing to buy common stocks and repurchase our own stock. We are also ready, willing and able to consider attractive acquisitions in the Insurance or ventures worlds. I'd like to thank you again for your ongoing commitment to Markel. We can't build one of the world's great companies without fellow long-term owners who have the same goal. We believe that our win, win, win architecture of serving our customers and our fellow employees creates wonderful returns for our shareholders as well. We are delighted to connect with you to update you following these first quarter results and we look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming events shortly. With that, Andrea, if you would be so kind as to open the floor for questions. Well, it's like Abraham Lincoln once said, how many legs does the dog have if you call a tail a leg? The answer is four. So calling the tail a leg doesn't make it a leg, whether the accounting terms are available for sale or held to maturity, whichever one you use, the mark-to-market value is a real economic number that's out there. We think about things in real economic terms. So we really don't expect to have any changes in what we are doing or the way that we label the accounting. Now there's another sort of accounting nuance that's very important to remember is that. The philosophy on fixed income is that we buy fixed income to match against the reserves of what we expect to pay out in claims and expenses of running the business. And the reason we buy fixed income securities that have a duration of between four years and five years is, because that matches the duration of what we expect to pay out the claims over. So when interest rates rise and you see a mark-to-market decrease in the fixed income portfolio, if you were really doing the net present value of the reserves, you would see an equal and offsetting reduction in the amount of the reserves. Now as an accounting matter, we don't discount our reserves to their net present value. So economically what we are doing is we are hedging and matching and saying straight up either way because one of the things that we fully believe is that we have no idea how to predict accurately what interest rates are going to do. So either way, whether they go up or whether they go down, we are hedged, we are matched. We are making a spread of return between the positive yields on a bond portfolio and the negative cost of flow that we get through underwriting profitability, and as long as we keep that spread positive number, things add up to the good over time. Good morning, Mark. It's probably worth talking about the warrants and how they impact. Yeah. I don't have precise numbers at my fingertips, but it would -- the duration would be roughly four and a quarter four and a third, something like that. The new money rates are a little bit higher than what the existing yields are. So when we are investing new money, we are at the point of over the last couple of months with rates having gone up, that the new money investment rates are higher than the embedded yield. Sure. Mark, well, both of those organizations were acquired obviously as part of the Nephila acquisition and they were investments, quite honestly, that Nephila had made in those two operations. We have looked at it two ways. In both cases, management had ownership, had partial ownership of those businesses. And so they had an interest in realizing the value of those organizations at some point. And that had been sort of memorialized through the deals that Nephila put together with management in both cases. So we wanted to be fair to the management of those two operations and allowed them to realize the part of the value that they had created there. Obviously, we were able to unlock significant value for Nephila and Markel Corporation. And honestly, great businesses, great people, but there is quite a bit of time that is spent in terms of managing those operations that now we can fully devote to the core business, which is, fund management for cap risk and climate risk and we think the opportunity right now in the cat arena is significant. And so all of those things play into it, but really just getting super focused on our core business is probably the driver. To be just blunt, Mark, very -- we have very little information at this point coming out of the conflict. Obviously, as we all know, the war is still ongoing, and so it's not like you are able to send adjusters in and see what the status is on the ground. So we tried to make a good faith estimate of what could potentially be our exposure. I would tell you what we have put up, it is 100% IBNR at this point and really sort of thinking about what our net retentions could be and how our Reinsurance worked. Trying to put up something that we felt like was a very best estimate of what could happen, obviously the longer it goes on, both from a humanitarian standpoint and just economic damages standpoint, things get worse. But we do not write that much business in Ukraine or in Russia for that matter, timing in respects to our overall book of business. But, obviously, when you start adding up policy limits, you can get to some big numbers. But we really don't believe it is a material issue to Markel Corporation. But, again, the longer it goes, the worse it gets from a humanitarian situation, as well as an economic situation. Thank you very much. We enjoyed being with you. We hope to see you either in Omaha or Richmond soon. Be well."

            "name": "Richie Whitt",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. I am excited today to discuss with you our Insurance engine's first quarter results. Obviously, it's only 90 days into the year, but we are off to a strong start to the year. Many of the trends that we discussed throughout last year continued in the first quarter. The pricing environment continues to hold up well and organic growth remains strong. As Jeremy said, we achieved an 89% combined ratio for the period despite 2 points of losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Business production continues to be robust, with 16% growth in our underwriting operations, with gross written premium surpassing $2.5 billion for the quarter and that that's the first time we have done that and 17% growth within our program services operations. While we continue to benefit from a favorable pricing environment, we are also seeing new business growth across most of our product lines, in particular within our professional and general liability products. As Jeremy mentioned, we also had an active quarter in the ILS space, completing the sale of our majority interest in the Velocity MGA operations and announcing the sale of our Volante MGA operations, which we expect to close some time later this year. Both of these transactions unlock significant value from our Nephila acquisition in 2018 and also allowed Nephila to devote full attention to the opportunities they see in the cat arena right now. Now I will discuss our first quarter results within our Insurance engine, which include our underwriting operations, state and national program services operations, and Nephila Insurance-linked securities operations. So I will kick it off with the Insurance segment. Gross written premiums in the Insurance segment were up 19% in the quarter, with just under $2 billion in premium ridings, while earned premiums were up 16% for the period. We saw double-digit growth rates across all of our major product lines, in particular within the professional liability and general liability product lines, where we have identified new business opportunities in both our domestic and international operations, and have benefited from new program opportunities. We continue to benefit from favorable rating environment within most of our Insurance product lines, although rate increases achieved continue to gradually moderate. The combined ratio for the quarter in the Insurance segment was 87%, compared to 91% last year. The current year combined ratio included $20 million or 1 point of net losses related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict versus $39 million or 3 points of net losses last year related to Winter Storm Uri. Excluding the impact from these events, the combined ratio decreased by just over 1 point due to a 2-point decrease in our attritional loss ratio across several product lines, reflecting the impact from rising rates and our ability to write more premium in our preferred product classes. This was partially offset by a decrease in favorable development from prior accident year's losses in the quarter. Higher earned premiums have a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior accident year's loss ratio. So next I will talk about the Reinsurance segment. Gross written premium within the Reinsurance segment were up 8% for the quarter, while earned premiums were up 12%. Premium growth was driven by higher premiums in our general liability and professional liability lines, from both, new business and higher renewals, due in part to more favorable rates, along with the impact from favorable premium adjustments within our credit and surety, professional liability and general liability product lines. This growth was partially offset by lower premiums in our property and workers' compensation lines. Our property lines continue to run off as part of our exit strategy with the transition of our Reinsurance property lines to Nephila and the decision to discontinue writing retro property business within our underwriting operations. As of the end of the first quarter, in terms of Reinsurance property, we are fully off risk at this point. The reduction in worker's compensation was due to the non-renewal of one large quota share treaty. The combined ratio for the period within the Reinsurance segment was 95%, compared to 109% a year ago. The current year combined ratio included $15 million or 5 points of net losses from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, compared to $25 million or 10 points of losses last year related to Winter Storm Uri. Last year, the segment was also impacted by adverse development of $19 million related to losses from COVID-19. Excluding the impact from these events, the Reinsurance segment combined ratio decreased 2 points due to lower adverse development on prior accident years' losses, partially offset by a slightly higher current accident year attritional loss ratio. The segment had adverse -- had modest adverse loss development this quarter, driven entirely by the impact from favorable prior year premium adjustments, offset in part by favorable loss development in our property product lines. The current accident year attritional loss ratio increased due to mix of business since our discontinued property lines carried a lower attritional loss ratio, partially offset by decreases this year in attritional loss ratio within our general liability and general liability lines. Next, I will touch on program services and other fronting operations and our ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. So as a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium from our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Our program services and other fronting operations continue their strong performance with program services producing $706 million in premiums during the period and total revenues from funding operations of $34 million with continued strong profit margins. Our ILS operations consist entirely of Nephila operations going forward. Operating revenues were flat to last year with higher revenues at our Volante MGA operations, offset by lower revenues at the Velocity MGA operations due to the sale of that unit in February. While Velocity will continue to partner with and produce significant premiums in support of Nephila funds, post-sale, the MGA's commission revenues obviously will no longer be included in Nephila's results. Nephila's assets under management within the fund management operations were $8.6 billion as of March 31, 2022. I will finish up with a few comments about market conditions and obviously happy to answer any questions during Q&A. As I said earlier in my comments, trends continue largely in line with what we discussed at year end. Rates have held up well and organic growth has remained solid. Rate increases continue to gradually moderate, but have held up better than we would have predicted a quarter or two ago. I believe that uncertainty around inflation, both economic and social, financial market volatility, including interest rate increases, recession concerns and the Russian-Ukraine conflict, have all played some role in supporting continued underwriting discipline in the market. There continues to be much discussion in the industry around inflation and its impact on claims cost. As you would expect, I think, we are baking more claims inflation into both our pricing and reserving and believe rate increases remain ahead of claims inflation. We will be watching each of our over 100 specialty lines very closely, and we will adjust underwriting and pricing strategies as needed to maintain profitability. Bottomline, we are right where we want to be at the end of the first quarter and I got to tell you, that feels great considering where we stood at the end of the first quarter in 2020 with COVID-19 and at the end of the first quarter in 2021 with Winter Storm Uri. Even better however, we are really excited about the opportunities for the rest of the year. Thanks for your time today and now I will turn things over to Tom. Jeff, this is Richie. I will take a shot and I will see if Jeremy or Tom want to add in. I think you got to start with recognizing that you are not seeing much in terms of the data at this point. When we talk to our claims folks, they are really not seeing a whole lot of claims inflation showing up in our numbers yet. However, we know with all the things that are going on out in the environment, both CPI inflation, litigation, finance, toward the erosion of tort reform over the years. We know that claims inflation is running higher than it historically has. I can't give you a precise number, and obviously, we write, as I said earlier, on the order of 100 different lines of business and so it would be different in each of those lines of business. But I do think it's more than what we have historically seen. But I still believe, when you look at the rate increases that we are still achieving, we are in the high-single digits in terms of rate increases. I still believe there's a margin on that versus what claims inflation is running at right now. I would say it is staying pretty rational. But, yes, I mean, clearly, we are seeing more competition as the rate of increase has decelerated. So I think some of the new entrants, both company and MGA, I think, they have had some impact on the margin. I do think, after three years and in some cases four years of rate increases, people's assessment of rate adequacy changes and so their appetite changes. So this market -- the cycle is no different than past cycles. We are probably past the peak of this cycle. But it is coming off very gradually and I think, I said in my comments, probably more gradually than I would have predicted a few quarters ago and I think it's some of the things that have been developing, the war, inflation, interest rates, you name it. I think there's enough things out there that give people pause and so it's been a very gradual gentle glide on the rates as opposed to maybe something faster that I might have predicted a few quarters ago. Thank you. It was a relatively light first quarter in terms of cat, Mark, excluding Russia-Ukraine. And so, I would say, it's a combination. I would say it was a relatively light first quarter in terms of where we write cat exposed business. But also, I mean, I think, it is showing up the fact that we have been derisking in terms of cat over the last several years. And so, whereas we would have budgeted probably 3 or so points of cat losses the last year or two, our budget for cat losses in 2022, I think, is around 1%. Is that right, Jeremy? So, it's a combination of both, a relatively light first quarter and the fact that we have been diligently working to reduce cat exposure in the portfolio. So, that's that. Yes."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Tom mentioned, the first quarter of 2022 highlights the benefits that come from our diversified three-engine architecture at Markel. Volatility within the public equity markets and the effects of rising interest rates on our bond portfolio while weighing down our investment returns during the quarter were somewhat mitigated by strong operating results within our Insurance and Markel Ventures operations. Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $2.5 billion for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of 16%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume, more favorable rates and expanded product offerings across many of our product lines, with the most notable growth coming from our professional liability and general liability product lines, both our Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Retention of gross written premiums was 86% in 2022, which is down 1 point from the same period last year. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2022 was an 89%, which included $35 million or 2 points of net losses in loss adjustment expenses and $12.3 million of ceded reinstatement premiums attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This compares to a 94% combined ratio for the same period last year, which included $64 million or 4 points of losses attributable to Winter Storm Uri and $19 million or 1 point of adverse development arising from a change in our estimate of COVID-19 ultimate losses a year ago. Excluding these loss impacts from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2022 was an 87%, compared to an 88% for the same period of 2021. This improvement reflects a lower attritional loss ratio within our Insurance segment and a lower expense ratio, partially offset by less favorable development on prior year loss reserves. Higher earned premiums in 2022 compared to 2021 had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact on our prior accident year's loss ratio. With regards to prior year loss reserve development, prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $96 million in the first quarter of this year, compared to $91 million in the first quarter of last year. Turning to our investment results. Net investment losses were $358 million in the first quarter of 2022 and were primarily attributable to a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by unfavorable market value movements. This comparison net investment gains of $527 million in the first quarter of 2021, attributable to an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio driven by favorable market value movements. As I have mentioned in prior calls, given our long-term focus, variability and the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected, and we typically measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regards to net investment income, we reported $73 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $97 million in the same period last year. The decrease this quarter reflects the impact of losses recognized on equity method investments in the first quarter of this year, most notably, our investment in Hagerty. Net investment income on our fixed maturities in 2022 was consistent with 2021, as the impact of higher average holdings of fixed maturities in 2022 was largely offset by lower yields compared to the same period a year ago. As a reminder, for accounting purposes, we are deemed to have the ability to exercise significant influence over Hagerty, and, therefore, account for our investment in Hagerty under the equity method rather than a fair value. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Hagerty was $239 million, which was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. As of March 31, 2022, the estimated value of our investment based on the closing stock price of Hagerty's Class A common shares was approximately $840 million. Net unrealized investment gains decreased $476 million net of taxes during the first quarter of this year, reflecting a decline in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates during the first quarter. As a reminder, we tend to hold substantially all of our fixed maturities until they mature. Now, I will cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 35% to $950 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $707 million for the comparable quarter last year. This increase reflects the contribution of revenues from our December 2021 acquisition of Metromont and August 2021 acquisition of Buckner, as well as strong organic growth across many of our other businesses. EBITDA for Market Ventures was $96 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to $81 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our Construction Services and Consulting Services businesses, as well as a contribution from Metromont. As a reminder, EBITDA in the first quarter of 2021 included a pretax disposition gain of $22 million in connection with the sale of a portion of one of our healthcare businesses. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter, our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27%, which results having a relatively small pretax loss during the period. The estimated annual effective tax rate was 21% in the first quarter of both 2021 and 2022. We reported a net loss of common share to common shareholders of $53 million in the first quarter of 2022, compared to net income to common shareholders of $574 million in the same period a year ago, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Guidance of loss to shareholders for the first quarter of 2022 was $529 million, compared to comprehensive income to shareholders of $359 million in the first quarter a year ago, again, driven by both fixed maturity and public equity valuations. Finally, I will highlight a few transactions in the period and make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. First, in March of this year, we completed the previously announced buyout transaction related to Markel CATCo, accelerating the return of all remaining trapped capital to investors in the Markel CATCo Funds. Under the terms of the transaction, we provided cash funding of $45 million to purchase substantially all of Markel capital funds' investments in Markel CATCo Re, which at present we anticipate being returned to us in time as remaining trust fund collateral is released. We also made $102 million in additional payments net of Insurance proceeds to or for the benefit of investors in exchange for releases of all claims related to the transaction, the CATCo businesses and investors' investments in the funds including any pending litigation, which was recognized as an expense during the first quarter of 2022. We expect that the remaining runoff of CATCo will have minimal effect on our future results. Second, within our Nephila ILS operations, there were two transactions worth touching upon. In February 2022, we sold the majority of our controlling interest in our Velocity Managing General Agent operations for total cash consideration $181 million, which resulted in a gain of $107 million. We continue to have a minority interest in Velocity after the sale and Velocity will continue to be a source of risk origination for our Nephila fund management operations. In March 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our controlling interest in our Volante Managing General Agent operations. This transaction is expected to close later this year in the third quarter and is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Following the disposition of Nephila-Volante operations, our Nephila ILS operations will be solely comprised of its core fund management operations. Turning to cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $415 million for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $318 million for the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2022 reflected strong cash flows from our underwriting operations given the growth in premium volume. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14.1 billion at the end of March, compared to $14.7 billion at the end of the year. During the quarter, we repurchased 63,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program. All-in-all, we are pleased with the start to the year, particularly with the strong results in our Insurance and Markel Ventures operations. We remain committed to building shareholder value over time. We believe we continue to advance this effort in the first quarter. With that, I will turn it over to Richie to talk more about our Insurance businesses. And Mark, it's Jeremy. I'd like to just add one other point. We typically only call out large, significant named events... ... within our cat. So we don't tend to sort of get all of that sort of cat activity and disclose that when they are smaller amounts. So there's always a little bit of, if you will, almost like attritional cat. We sort of embed in our underlying results. But then to Richie's point, our modeled average annual losses have come down significantly in recent years, as we have addressed reducing the volatility in our book associated with catastrophes. Yeah. It's more -- it's Jeremy again. It's more efficiency and leverage, right? We continue to enjoy growth -- significant growth on the topline and we are able to sort of not see the direct and controllable expenses on that base grow at the same rate. So we continue to benefit in that, that way. So nothing significant besides that, I would really call out. Yeah. That's the market -- that is the one part of the market that has resisted hardening and rates have continued to gently drift down, yeah, 2% to 3%. As a result, I mean, we still think there's margin in the primary side of the business and so we continue to write business there, but we recognize that the margin is smaller in workers' comp right now. When we got to looking at that Reinsurance deal and with the cumulative rate decreases that have happened over the last few years, we didn't believe it stacked up and so we stepped away. Right. Relative to workers' comp, over the last few years. Workers' comp has been a great line of business for several years now, which that helps explain why people have been competitive in it. There have been good results. But I just wouldn't expect the kinds of results we have had -- we have enjoyed in workers' comp over the last several years, in the next few years, unless something changes in terms of the pricing dynamic. Sure. Mark, it's Jeremy. I will take a stab at that and Richie or Tom can join in as well. With regards to where we provide what the approximation to the fair value might be based on the traded A shares, you can rough think of Markel having about 23% ownership in Hagerty. And so just think of that in terms of their sort of market capitalization at a certain point in time. That's a little bit of that fair value proxy. As far as what's recorded in our books, it's more a function of us taking our proportionate share of Hagerty's underlying earnings and any other capital sort of transactions. We do have to record that, however, on a quarter lag, because obviously Hagerty is a publicly traded company. We don't have access to the information on top. It's not significant period-over-period. So, just thinking of the relationship between the two figures that we report on and a little bit of how to think about that that sort of fair value proxy that we put in. Yeah. Sure. So one of the things that will create a little bit of underlying volatility with regards to our held to what we hold on the actual Markel balance sheet and other assets. We will see a little bit of volatility relative to the mark-to-market that Hagerty has relative to their warrants. So if you think of the warrant activity because of the move in the Hagerty stock price through the end of the year that creates sort of a liability and an expense that we reflected it as part of the reduction we would have seen at 03/31 versus 12/31. So that creates a little bit more volatility. As a kind of more of a one-off, they also in either year-end results would have had the transaction costs associated with going public. But that's really a one-time event. Yeah. What -- yeah. What we hold on the balance sheet is just a function of their underlying -- our proportionate share of their underlying earnings and any other capital transactions. But it's not the movement in the fair value of their stock."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nTom Gayner: Good morning and welcome to the Markel Group 2023 year end conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner and I serve as your CEO. I am joined today by Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance Operations; and Brian Costanzo, our Chief Financial Officer. Our plan this morning is to make just a few comments and then open the floor for your questions. Many years ago, I remember the great football coach, John McKay, saying the most exciting place you can be is in the locker room at halftime when you are down 10 points. I\u2019ll make no mistake about it. We are down 10 points, almost literally and figuratively from where we\u2019d like to be in our insurance operations. Just like a good football team though, winning remains the goal, but we need to do better. We share your disappointment in those results. We are also committed to taking the necessary actions to make them better. We are in the locker room right now. We are adjusting our game plans. We are clear-eyed about where we stand on the scoreboard and where we fell short. We are taking active steps to improve our position. Jeremy will speak to our insurance engine in just a moment and his team continue to be hard at the task of understanding and quantifying areas of weakness as well as strengths and taking the necessary steps to improve results. We have made several significant management changes in the past year and taking actions such as withdrawing or reducing certain lines of business, reducing line sizes, increasing accountability, modifying incentive compensation arrangements, increasing the scope and scale for some of the proven winners in our insurance operations and decreasing or eliminating pockets with disappointing performance. The transition year of 2023 produced results well below our expectations, but I am confident that we have recognized the pieces of our insurance engine where we needed to make changes and that we are taking appropriate steps to make things better. Many areas in insurance produced wonderful results of which we should all be proud. Those results were offset and obscured by certain limited but meaningful pockets of underperformance. As such, the aggregate combined ratio came in higher than our original plans. Fortunately, while we did experience adverse development in the fourth quarter, we did indeed have positive development \u2013 redundant development for the full year. We always operate with the core belief that we will always set our reserves at levels that we believe will prove to be more likely redundant than deficient. I am proud of our insurance team and that despite the difficult year we continue to live up to the standard of integrity and discipline in setting loss reserves. We have done so for years. We will continue to hold to that standard going forward. Jeremy will provide more details on the insurance results of 2023 in his comments. I also want to reinforce that the changes we made in 2023 and those that we continue to refine in 2024 and beyond will take time to show up in the financial statements. Every decision or action that we take in insurance takes at least a year to fully flow through our financial statements. We look forward to reporting better results in future periods as the actions we have taken take hold. Turning to some more positive and fun things to talk about, in 2023, we earned excellent results in our ventures and investment operations. Recurring investment income from dividends and interest rose 64% from $447 million to $735 million in 2023. Every engine at the Markel Group continued to produce cash and that cash, along with maturities from our bonds portfolio, was invested in higher yielding fixed income instruments. Dividend income also rose due to net purchases in the equity portfolio and dividend increases. I think you can expect this positive trend to continue in 2024 with interest rates at current levels. We also repurchased 322,000 Markel Group shares in 2023 for $445 million compared to 233,000 shares for $291 million in 2022. Share repurchases continue to be a high priority use of capital for us at current prices. In our Markel Ventures operations, top line revenues grew 5% from $4.8 billion to just a smidge under $5 billion. More importantly, operating income rose 35% from $325 million to $438 million and EBITDA rose 24% from $506 million to $628 million. We did not make any new platform acquisitions in 2023. We were able to add to our VSC operations and increase our ownership stake in certain situations. We also completed an acquisition at Costa just after January 1 that will add to our 2024 results. We remain disciplined and thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions and it is exciting to see our existing businesses find ways to grow. This is simply a phenomenal performance by the Ventures team. It reflects the ongoing maturity and development of the Markel Ventures businesses. I could not be more proud of the team from top to bottom as they continue to produce excellent results and do so in the context of the values of the Markel style. In our investment operations, we purchased over $300 million net of publicly traded equities, which met our longstanding four-part investment tests. We earned a total equity return of 21.6% during the year and I am happy with those results. They were produced with our discipline fully intact. Among other things, the unrealized gain on our equity portfolio now stands at over $6 billion pre-tax. I am not aware of many companies that enjoy a position such as that. Thank you all for your longstanding support of the Markel Group. I share your disappointment in some of the results within our insurance engine, and I am confident that we are taking appropriate and necessary steps to improve those results. Meanwhile, given our diversification of the three-engine system and our excellent results at Ventures and positive investment results, we are making good economic progress at the Markel Group. While we continue to deemphasize book value per share as the sole describer of economic progress around here, it\u2019s probably worth noting that book value per share went up over 17% in 2023. In the last 5 years that it has increased to the compound annual growth rate of 11% despite what we have described as some of the most challenging circumstances we have ever experienced. I am deeply optimistic that we are on track and make progress in 2024 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to update you on the 2023 numbers and then to Jeremy for his review of our insurance operations. Following Jeremy\u2019s comments, we will open the floor for questions. Brian?\nBrian Costanzo: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I am happy to be with you all this morning to discuss our 2023 results. As Tom mentioned, 2023 illustrated the diversity of our three-engine system. While our combined ratio result for the year is disappointing, our ventures and investment engines had terrific years with EBITDA from Markel Ventures, the value of our investments and our net investment income hitting record highs. With that, let\u2019s jump into the results. Starting out with our consolidated results. We reported net income to common shareholders of $2 billion in 2023 versus the net loss to common shareholders of $253 million in 2022, with the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders in 2023 was $2.3 billion versus a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.2 billion in 2022, driven most notably by the favorable swings in our fixed maturity and public equity portfolios. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion in 2023 versus $2.7 billion in 2022, reflecting strong cash flows from each of our three operating engines. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $15 billion at the end of 2023. As Tom mentioned earlier, we repurchased $445 million of Markel Group common stock this year under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $291 million last year. Turning over to our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew 4% to $10.3 billion in 2023 compared to $9.8 billion in 2022, reflecting new business and more favorable rates across many product lines within our insurance segment, most notably our personal and property product lines. We saw lower premium volume within select domestic professional liability and general liability product lines where we adjusted writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes in particular within public D&O. Our consolidated combined ratio was 98% in 2023 versus 92% in 2022. The increase in the combined ratio was primarily driven by higher attritional loss ratios in 2023 on our general liability and professional liability product lines within our insurance segment in reaction to increasing estimates of future loss cost trends. Prior year losses developed favorably by $39 million in 2023 versus $167 million in 2022. We experienced meaningful favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in 2023, most notably within our international professional liability products and our global property and marine and energy product lines within the insurance segment. This favorable development was largely offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines across both underwriting segments and adverse development on a discontinued portion of our public entity product line within our Reinsurance segment. Jeremy will provide more insight on our loss development experience during his comments. Moving to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $735 million in 2023 versus $447 million last year, a 64% increase as we reinvested maturing securities in our fixed income portfolio at higher interest rates. The total size of our fixed income portfolio also grew in alignment with our growth in reserves given we generally match our insurance liabilities with highly rated fixed income securities of similar duration and currency. The largest contributor to our increase in net investment income is related to our cash and cash equivalents, where we have increased our allocation to money market funds to take advantage of the current interest rate environment. Net investment gains of $1.5 billion in 2023 reflect favorable market value movements driving a return of 21.6% on our public equity portfolio during the year. This compares to net investment losses of $1.6 billion in 2022. As you have heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. At the end of 2023, the fair value of our equity portfolio included pre-tax cumulative unrealized holding gains of $6.1 billion. Net unrealized investment gains included in other comprehensive income in 2023 were $307 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment losses of $1.2 billion net of taxes in 2022. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our bond investments until maturity and we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. The cumulative amount of pre-tax unrealized losses on our bond portfolio was $560 million as of the end of 2023. We continue our longstanding practice of investing in the highest quality fixed income securities. As of December 31, 97% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, moving over to our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 5% to just under $5 billion for 2023, up from $4.8 billion last year, reflecting higher prices and increased demand across several businesses, most notably within our construction services and equipment manufacturing businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 24% to a record high of $628 million in 2023, up from $506 million in 2022. The increase was driven by increases in most all of our products businesses within the consumer and building products, equipment manufacturing and transportation areas driven by increased revenues and higher margins in 2023 versus 2022 as material and freight costs stabilized this year. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to further discuss our insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. As Tom and Brian alluded to, we experienced mixed results within our insurance operations in 2023. An overall 98% combined ratio for the year is disappointing and below our long-term goals. I assume the reins of our insurance platform last year and the reality is that 2023 was not the year I anticipated. I think it\u2019s important for me to take a few minutes and explain what\u2019s happened, what we are doing about it as well as to highlight what is going well. Our result for the year was heavily influenced by the recent loss trends within select product lines within our North American casualty and professional liability books and to a lesser extent, some tough lessons within our intellectual property CPI product line. Before I touch upon the adverse development this quarter, let me first highlight some of the best performing parts of our business. Our International division had an outstanding year in 2023, achieving both double-digit top line growth and a combined ratio below 90. Our international team\u2019s portfolio management over the last few years is starting to show in the results. In 2023, we expanded our international operations into Australia and within Europe. We added to our product capabilities, further diversifying and growing our platform. We see more opportunities to grow internationally in the years ahead. Both of our non-underwriting businesses, State National and Nephila had fantastic years. State National continues to grow, maintain exemplary discipline around reinsurer credit management and produce exceptional operating margins. Nephila demonstrated itself as a market leader, delivering high-quality data and insight-driven portfolio construction, while deploying innovative strategies to maximize returns for investors. Through meaningful improvements in pricing adequacy in the property cat market, Nephila is well positioned going into 2024 and beyond. Note, some of how Markel participates in the recent property market improvements, occur outside of our reported combined ratio and are reflected in our results at Nephila. Together, our ongoing fronting and ILS operations, excluding the impacts of gains on the disposition of subsidiaries in both years, contributed operating income before amortization of $146 million in 2023, up almost 40% from a year ago. We were excited to announce the formation of State National global platform during the quarter. We look forward to continued growth and profitability in these business units. Further, we will continue to deploy our world class insurance platforms across underwriting, fronting and ILS to maximize returns for Markel Group. Our global reinsurance operations reported a disappointing combined ratio for the year, much of that related to adverse development within our reinsurance casualty lines in the years before 2020. As discussed in recent quarters, we undertook meaningful changes regarding our appetite and approach to portfolio management. We are focused on improved long-term profitability. We have a refreshed reinsurance leadership team and portfolio and we feel very good about where we stand today in that business. Finally, while our Specialty division has faced challenges within portions of our casualty and professional liability lines, meaningful segments of our specialty portfolio are performing well. For example, our property in marine, small commercial, personal lines and surety product lines, all had outstanding years, achieving double-digit growth and combined ratios at or well below our 2023 targets. Together, these product lines alone represent about $3 billion in annual gross written premium volume. The growth in these classes and several other segments of our business demonstrates our strong core. These business units are well established and poised to produce solid underwriting results in the future. Turning back to our domestic casualty and professional liability insurance portfolios. We have been challenged by the market dynamics within the contractor segments of our brokerage access in umbrella and primary general liability lines in casualties and our risk-managed E&O and D&O lines in professional liability. This includes all of the factors driving a loss cost trends that we have discussed in previous quarters and are widely reported across the industry, including social and economic inflation and litigation financing trends. We have meaningfully increased our prior accident year loss reserves in these specific lines throughout the latter half of 2022 and during 2023 to respond to these emerging loss trends. However, as the year progressed and the loss trends continue to deteriorate, it became clear that we needed to take a more focused review of our portfolios to better understand the underlying dynamics and causes of the adverse loss development trends. In doing so, we would ensure we are maintaining healthy portfolios with sufficient rate adequacy as we move forward. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we conducted an extensive loss review of these lines and took meaningful action to put these prior year development trends behind us. While we can never have absolute certainty that there will be no further development within these portfolios, we are confident that with the additional actions we took in the quarter, we have created an even greater level of resiliency in our balance sheet, consistent with our long-held conservative reserving philosophy. Our overall casualty book is concentrated in construction business. Through our review, we determined the construction defect claims within our casualty construction portfolio and the longer reporting tail than originally anticipated. Average claim severity also continues to increase in this line due to the various forms of inflation we mentioned. Consequently, the business is not as profitable as we thought when we originally wrote it. We also determined that there was a greater propensity within our access and umbrella general liability and risk-managed E&O professional books of limits below our attachment point being eroded, pushing more claims into our layers. Further, reporting of these claims has lagged historical development patterns due to the effects of court closures and claim backlogs, stemming from the COVID pandemic, aggressive tactics by the plaintiff bar and slow claim reporting trends. Considering these factors, we also added significant reserves to our casualty lines within our Reinsurance segment in accident years 2019 and prior. These trends have been observable within our incurred loss development in accident years prior to 2020. Since that time, we have achieved significant rate increases across many of these classes and have taken a variety of underwriting actions. While these actions have significantly improved the profitability of these lines, we also added to reserves to our 2021 and 2022 accident years in the fourth quarter. We did this recognizing that the difference between loss ratios prior to the pandemic and post pandemic had reached a differential that did not feel consistent with our conservative approach to reserving and the ultimate cost to settle the claims on more recent years may prove to be higher than we initially anticipated. We had already adjusted our 2023 accident year attritional loss ratios at the beginning of the year in reaction to concerns around increasing loss trends. Given the most recent accident years are green, we feel it best to ensure we are maintaining an appropriate margin of safety to reduce the likelihood of future adverse development. That being said, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with reserving long-tailed lines of business that won\u2019t be settled for many years to come. Most of our reserves in these product lines are held in IBNR, particularly in the more recent years. In fact, as of year-end 2023, 70% of our total reserves are in IBNR, up from 67% at the end of 2022 and 63% 5 years ago. Despite these challenges, it\u2019s important to note we did have favorable development for the full year 2023. We continue to operate with a core belief that we should set reserves at a level that will prove more likely redundant than deficient. We remain committed to the principle and hope you take some comfort in the fact that it remains true for the full year 2023 despite the challenges we faced. Now let me touch on what we\u2019re doing going into 2024. We will carry our positive momentum into the year from our International, State National and Nephila businesses and our specialty product lines. We are looking to use our power of the platform to create opportunities for growth. Regarding our casualty construction and risk managed professional liability lines, we are actively managing these portfolios. We\u2019ve made changes to personnel. We will be exiting unprofitable classes in subsegments. We will reduce excessive concentrations in order to ensure our optimal portfolio balance, and we will be appropriately adjusting rates, terms and conditions, limits, attachment points and other factors. We are confident in our ability to re-underwrite these products back to levels of profitability we aspire to. We\u2019ve done it before. We are determined to do it again. But these actions will take some time to earn their way through the results. Just a couple of comments on the pricing environment. It continues to be the case that each product area and region of the world has its own story. But broadly speaking, rates are continuing to hold up fairly well. By and large, are keeping up with and in some cases, are slightly ahead of our view of trend. We had many products where rates are up 5% to 10% and for most casualty product lines, and particularly of rate adequacy is in question, we are seeing success pushing for rate. Within our property offering, the pricing environment remains attractive. And while we expect increases to moderate in \u201824, the environment is constructive with healthy margins and anticipated returns on capital. Professional liability remains challenging from a pricing standpoint. While the rate of pricing declines on public D&O business have moderated, we remain very cautious with regards to current levels of rate adequacy and are managing our portfolio and exposures accordingly. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. And Auger [ph] we will open the floor for questions, if you\u2019d be so kind.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Charlie Lederer at Citi.\nCharlie Lederer: Great. Good morning. Can you expand on some of the underwriting and incentive compensation changes you mentioned you\u2019re making and how long of a process do you anticipate that being \u2013 is this something we should think about impacting your appetite or growth just given GL and professional liability are your largest products.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things. First off, with regards to both our general liability and professional liability portfolios, there is a lot of business within those portfolios. And actually, some of the segments within them, if we look at casualty and we think about environmental, if we think about healthcare, we think about our binding operations, they are performing very well. In professional, if we think about commercial D&O and E&O is performing very well, financial advisers. So we have segments within those portfolios that we can continue to grow internationally as well on both the casualty and professional side. So pockets of the portfolio, we are growing. We can continue to grow. They are meeting our profitability targets in the classes that are more challenged in that space, even in the fourth quarter alone, we shed over $100 million of premium in those classes and still sort of grew our top line within the insurance results. So we are remixing the portfolio. We\u2019ve seen and reported over the last \u2013 over the course of 2023, a more moderated pace of top line growth. And we\u2019re focused on bottom line profitability that may continue to be the case, and we will continue to remix the portfolio. But we\u2019ve been doing some of that already. As far as changes in underwriting, practices, if you will, we really are taking a very targeted view within each of our product areas and it\u2019s a tailored approach with regards to what we\u2019re doing. So we have some classes. That are all in segments within our portfolios that we\u2019re going to exit or we have exited altogether. We\u2019ve got areas where we will take subclasses or sub-segments and reduce our writings. Clearly, we will push rate. Clearly, we will address wordings in terms and conditions. We\u2019re looking at attachment points. We\u2019re looking at limits profiles. We\u2019re looking at geography mix. A lot of what we\u2019re doing is going to be about portfolio balance and overall portfolio management. So a lot that\u2019s happening across the insurance operation right now.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. I guess just given those mix changes, should we expect the current accident year margins, I guess, to kind of look very different next year? Or I guess they have moved around each quarter? Should the remixing be a help or kind of more flattish or like we\u2019ve seen looking at\u2026\nJeremy Noble: Yes, more difficult to talk about a trend. As Tom mentioned, it takes a while for things to earn through in insurance, right? So heading into a year, the portfolio an earned premium basis is already sort of on risk and working its way through. So any actions that we have taken recently or we take here shortly, it will take a little while to earn through. That being said, everything that we are doing right now is focused on being accretive to earnings as we move forward. So I expect that over time, what we will see is an improved profitability and improved margins on the current portfolio.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it. Thanks. Just one quick one. On the credit losses from intellectual property, exposure. Is that in the loss ratio or the expense ratio in insurance?\nJeremy Noble: That\u2019s in the loss ratio.\nCharlie Lederer: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We will move next to Mark Hughes at Truist Securities.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you, good morning. Is there a, say, an interim combined ratio target for 2024 that you might be willing to share, understanding that it takes a while to fully implement these steps and make progress. But is there an interim target?\nTom Gayner: Yes, Mark, it\u2019s Tom. Better\nMark Hughes: Can you quantify it better?\nTom Gayner: No.\nMark Hughes: I like better. any numbers? Yes?\nTom Gayner: Let\u2019s get better and then we will talk about it.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Understood. And then you talked about the GL and you focus on the construction issue. Are you seeing some inflation or lengthening of tail outside of construction? Is it a broader issue in GL?\nJeremy Noble: Well, I think that the part associated with the lengthening of the tail is a bit specific to the construction defect portion within our contractors on both the primary and excess basis. So that\u2019s a pretty specific point there. With regards to the effects more widely around inflation, be it economic inflation or social inflation, that happens across, particularly in U.S. logs. That happens in a number of areas as we\u2019ve been talking about. But again, more pronounced in the general liability and professional liability lines that we\u2019ve been speaking to over the course of the year.\nMark Hughes: You mentioned that you\u2019re having success in pushing for rate where you need it. Is that to say pricing in those lines is accelerating? Do you see that across the board? Or maybe just within your own book.\nJeremy Noble: We will see sort of obviously have the year trends in development, and we very much have the intention in those pockets, particularly in the casualty that I\u2019m mentioning the rate is needed, and we\u2019ve had success in pushing rate. I don\u2019t think we get all the way there overnight. And I think it has to be something that is sustained. I also don\u2019t think that, that is unique to sort of Markel circumstances. I think casualty is getting a lot of coverage around the sort of trends and the pervasive nature of social inflation and some of what we\u2019ve experienced ourselves, I think, is being shared in the industry. So I would expect that it will continue to be \u2013 will continue to be the opportunity to push on rate within casualty lines in \u201824.\nMark Hughes: Yes. And then when you think about some of these inflation factors, could you maybe assume that they would get better? And since they didn\u2019t, you had some adverse \u2013 or did they actually deteriorate just thinking about the kind of broader reported inflation. Supposedly, that\u2019s key. But does that \u2013 is that having a delayed impact on your own loss trends as you\u2019re seeing them?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. I mean, look, inflation is a component as a broad statement, Mark. But what I would suggest is that in the fourth quarter, we really took a far more extensive review, right? And we got our leaders across underwriting and claims and actuarial. We aided ourselves with third-party experts gaining insights and broader industry data for purposes of comparability, and we did a much more data-intensive exercise. So we are doing a deeper review into our underlying books and trends to get better insights around the causes of the adverse development. So as a kind of an example, Ron mentioned, we start segmenting out our contractors portions of our books. We then further segment construction defect claims trends and data from non-construction defect. We looked at practice exposures versus project exposures. We looked at wording, claims handling practices, various assumptions we\u2019re making. So, all that to give you a sense of the depth and the robustness of the review that we had. Undoubtedly, the rising level of cost to settle and adjust claims is linked to inflation in all exports. So we\u2019re seeing that. But there are other aspects that give us that led to some of the reserve adjustments we made in the fourth quarter, but also, I think, importantly, lead us to have a lot more confidence that we understand the recent experience and that we\u2019re in a position now to put that adverse loss experience and trend behind us as we move forward.\nTom Gayner: And let me jump in. This is Tom. And Mark, and this is really for everybody. I want to make sure we\u2019re not driving by looking at the hood ornament. And we keep our eyes on the horizon a bit here. So obviously, we\u2019re talking a lot about the insurance results. This is a Markel Group conference call. It\u2019s Martel Group that is \u2013 what you own shares in the book value per share, which, again, is dinged by amortization, and it\u2019s dinged by the unrealized losses in the bond portfolio, both of which I would argue were not real. It was up 17% last year. It\u2019s up 11% over the last 5 years. And the actions that I think if our roles were reversed and you were managing this business, where you would be directing capital when we have directed capital towards investments that show the fruits of that. We have directed capital towards ventures, which show the fruits of that. We have paired and pruned inside the insurance engine. And I think you will see the fruits of that in the fullness of time. And we are dividing that pie by fewer shares. So, that\u2019s \u2013 remain somewhat aware of the horizon as well as the hood ornament.\nMark Hughes: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Andrew Andersen at Jefferies.\nAndrew Andersen: Good morning. Could you provide a bit more color on to what loss trend you are looking to in some of these casualty lines? And if that\u2019s going to be higher in 2024 versus how 2023 shaked-out? I am just trying to think about the confidence in the more recent accident years, which also faced some pressure in the opportunity for growth here.\nJeremy Noble: Sure. So, I mean as far as sort of trend assumptions heading into \u201824, I think if anything, trend either holds up or moderate slightly, relative to \u201823 assumptions. We have a very broad portfolio. We are 100 major product lines. We write lots of different segments and classes all across the globe. So, there is no sort of simple way to break through the trend assumptions down. But in \u2013 as you would expect in longer tail cash-driven oriented lines, 5%, 6% to 8% is not an uncommon trend assumption. And in each of the cases, we look at our portfolios with regards to rate adequacy. We look at the pricing that we are obtaining relative to that trend. And we all level that into our loss selections.\nAndrew Andersen: Okay. And just backing up on the reserves, you had a charge fourth quarter of last year, movement on nine months \u201823, another charge fourth quarter of this year. Has the team evaluated doing an LPT in the past to create some finality to this?\nJeremy Noble: We have not done anything with regards to LPT or adverse development covers, and I won\u2019t sort of comment more broadly than that.\nAndrew Andersen: Okay. And maybe a few more questions here. Can you just \u2013 you mentioned litigation finance and casualty lines and how it\u2019s affected the loss trends where you raised your reserves. You have did kind of just mention perhaps trend moderates slightly in \u201824, but are you kind of thinking of the litigation finance environment slows down in the coming years, or do you see that accelerating?\nJeremy Noble: Generally speaking, I think a lot of what we have been talking about in our challenge with regards to recent social inflation trends. So, the cost to adjust and settle claims, prevalence of litigation funding, the aggressiveness of the plaintiffs for the sentiment of juries, all those sort of things, I don\u2019t necessarily have a reason to believe that, that abates anytime in the near-term. So, what we have to do is appropriately price our portfolio and ensure that we have got enough diversification and resiliency in the portfolios to stay a step ahead. And that\u2019s part of what mentioning the fact that we have taken a more cautious view on the more recent years to build in to attempt to build in a greater margin of safety around those concerns in line with our core philosophy of being more likely redundant than deficient. So, we will see how that plays out. But we have to be cautious in the sort of claims and litigation environment.\nAndrew Andersen: Okay. And maybe what\u2019s a good way to think about the reserves and the charges over the last couple of years. Has this \u2013 the bulk of this been on discontinued business for the Insurance segment, or is it kind of a mix of continuing, but we are making changes to attachments, pricing, etcetera?\nJeremy Noble: It\u2019s a mix. So, we had an example within reinsurance that Brian alluded to, it\u2019s associated with public entity business that we wrote in 2019 and prior that we discontinued at that time. We have aspects of our portfolio that are ongoing that we are trimming and rehabbing and trying to get right. We have got aspects within the portfolio that we are exiting either classes or sub-segments. So, I mean it\u2019s a bit of everything across the portfolio.\nAndrew Andersen: Thank you.\nOperator: We will move next to Scott Heleniak at RBC.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Good morning. Just to follow-up a little bit on that \u2013 on some of the classes you have exited so far. I am just curious how much of that you think you will be able to fix with rate \u2013 with higher rates and improving terms and conditions versus actually exiting or reducing exposure a lot. I don\u2019t know if you can get any color or any sense on that, just charging higher rates and changing terms and conditions versus having to exit or pair [ph] significantly?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. I mean I can\u2019t put any specifics or quantification around that. I gave you an example earlier to say, suggest in the fourth quarter and some of the lines at a larger sort of product line level that we shed over $100 million of premium in those lines that were more challenged where we were concerned about rate adequacy. And obviously, we grew more than that across everything else in the portfolio. We will continue to do that. So, we are focused within every facet of our insurance operations of ensuring that we are \u2013 have a healthy portfolio. That it\u2019s rate adequate and that we are earning appropriate returns on capital. And I will report to you each and every 90 days of how we are making progress in that space. But I can\u2019t sort of simplistically say, this is how it will break down. We are working hard.\nScott Heleniak: That\u2019s fair. And then on the insurance side, you called out personal lines and property being a growth area. Can you talk about the kind of what the growth rates there were last couple of quarters and particularly Q4. And whether is that \u2013 are you running that business mostly E&S admitted where you are seeing the opportunity, or is it a mix?\nJeremy Noble: It is a mix across the various segments of our portfolio where we are growing. So, I had mentioned personal lines. I mentioned property, inland marine, programs business, our binding operations, workers\u2019 comp, surety, a number of lines in our professional space. So, you have got U.S., you have got international, you have got alternative retail and wholesale or admitted and non-admitted business, it\u2019s a mix. But in the spaces like, for example, property, marine, personal lines, those will be more weighted towards E&S binding, more weighted towards E&S.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Okay. And then just one for Tom here, on Markel Ventures, you mentioned acquisition Costa made one in January. So, that\u2019s definitely nice to see. Can you talk about the pipeline there for Markel Ventures and whether you expect to see more deal activity this year?\nTom Gayner: I would guess, since the deal activity last year was zero, the odds have been more than that are pretty good. Our phone is starting to ring. I mean there have been some disruptions in financial markets from time-to-time. The fact that interest rates exist, changes the financing market for other folks out there. So, we are getting more inbound phone calls than we did any time in the last 12 months or 18 months.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will move next to Josh Hill at CapTrust Financial Advisors.\nJosh Hill: Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First off, great job with ventures and investments. Just a quick question on insurance, curious to get your opinion on whether or not the target laid out in the 2020 shareholder letter of 1051, so that $10 billion target for premiums, if any of that target is kind of what\u2019s coming back to causing some of these issues. Thanks.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Thanks for the question. I don\u2019t believe that that\u2019s the case. The \u2013 when we talked about 1051 is an idea within our global insurance operations. It\u2019s roughly to suggest what would need to be true if we were to aspire to double the size of our insurance platform at that time across all facets and do so at a level that was contributing meaningfully to the bottom line profits. The suggested growth rate there really isn\u2019t different than the growth rate that we had experienced over the past several decades as an organization. So, I don\u2019t think that, that put an unhealthy expectation around growth. I do think linked to that, we said what would need to be true with regards to product, talent, technology, to data, to geography, to various offerings, our trading relationships. So, there are a lot of aspects of what would need to be true to be that sort of insurance organization. And we continue to work very hard at building out the breadth of specialization and diversification across the platform. I think you will have gotten a sense from the call today. There is a lot of things that we have done, and we have done very well. Fortunately, there are some things that have come back over the course of 10 years. I mean a lot of the \u201819 and prior, that portfolio already existed prior to us making reference to 10.51 objective. We could not have contemplated at that time a pandemic and how sort of inflation, what would occur on the inflation side, both social and economic. So, the world moved out a little bit since we had that target. But our idea is around what we aspire to be and being ambitious as an organization to be better for our customers, to be better for our employees to create winning outcomes for our shareholders, those ideas remain.\nTom Gayner: And let me jump in here. This is Tom. I want to make one factual statement about that. Nobody\u2019s incentive compensation was tied to the 10, nobody, not mine, not Jeremy, it\u2019s not anybody in the organization. Every bit of incentive compensation is tied to profitability over time rather than growth without profitability. So, I know there has been some heartburn in the investment community about that. We hear you, but I do want to \u2013 at least state the fact that no incentive compensation was designed to do the 10.\nJosh Hill: Very good. I appreciate the candor and look forward to many more years. Keep it going.\nTom Gayner: Thank you.\nOperator: We will go next to Drew Estes at Banyan Capital.\nDrew Estes: Hi there. Thanks for taking the question. This one is for Tom. A great attribute of Markel is its optionality and capital allocation. So, given the performance in insurance, but the strength in ventures, how are you thinking about investing the incremental dollar? Do you prefer an investment in ventures right now until you can get insurance performing better? Thank you.\nTom Gayner: Drew, I appreciate the question, and I do think that speaks to one of the underlying strengths of Markel. And again, everybody is here working hard and fashion [ph] of teeth going on about some stuff. Economically, it was a pretty good year for Markel for exactly the reasons you speak of. Every incremental dollar is invested with the thought of, where will it best be treated, where will we get the highest return. So, we look at insurance, we look at investments. We look at Markel Ventures, and we start with a blank sheet of paper that would \u2013 and we also look at our own shares and say, where will that capital be treated best. And that\u2019s consistently been the case, and we will continue to be that way.\nDrew Estes: Thank you.\nTom Gayner: Appreciate it.\nOperator: We will take a follow-up from Charlie Lederer at Citi.\nCharlie Lederer: Hey. Thanks. Just one follow-up. Since you took the charges on the reinsurance side to reflect your insurance experience, could you talk about your conversations with your CMs? Have they reflected some of these changes, or do you anticipate that being a story for them or maybe the industry near-term?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, that\u2019s a good point, Charlie. So, in the fourth quarter, the increase in reserves that we took, particularly in the general liability space within our Reinsurance segment was not driven by underlying ceding reporting and incurred activity, but more so in part because of the findings and observations that we had within our insurance book and in contemplation of the risk that some of those things could exist within the underlying ceding reporting and incurred loss activity in time. So, again, I would say that was kind of a cautious approach to ensure that we are building an appropriate margin of safety be more likely redundant than deficient within the reinsurance book versus specific claims reporting activity in the period.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And we will move next to Andrew Andersen at Jefferies.\nAndrew Andersen: Hey. Thanks for taking the follow-up. On the insurance underlying loss ratio a little bit of noise this year between Vesttoo, some of the collateral protection I think in the first quarter, you had moved some picks related to bank activity. So, if I put it all together, relative to the reported underlying of $64 million, perhaps two points of one-time noise, is that a fair way to think about it?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. I think you are thinking about it right. There was \u2013 there is definitely some noise like you said. The intellectual property CPI and the credit losses we experienced there, specific banking losses we recognized in the first quarter, those sort of one-offs did contribute between one or two points to that trend. And then clearly, as we talked about throughout the year, higher attritional loss ratios across the cash, the general liability and professional liability lines being another driver.\nAndrew Andersen: And I suppose, business being written for the longer tail lines right now is already reflecting your increased view of loss trend for 2024.\nJeremy Noble: That\u2019s right.\nAndrew Andersen: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much. We appreciate your support. We look forward to checking in with you in 90 days. Be well.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to the Markel Group 2023 year end conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner and I serve as your CEO. I am joined today by Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance Operations; and Brian Costanzo, our Chief Financial Officer. Our plan this morning is to make just a few comments and then open the floor for your questions. Many years ago, I remember the great football coach, John McKay, saying the most exciting place you can be is in the locker room at halftime when you are down 10 points. I'll make no mistake about it. We are down 10 points, almost literally and figuratively from where we'd like to be in our insurance operations. Just like a good football team though, winning remains the goal, but we need to do better. We share your disappointment in those results. We are also committed to taking the necessary actions to make them better. We are in the locker room right now. We are adjusting our game plans. We are clear-eyed about where we stand on the scoreboard and where we fell short. We are taking active steps to improve our position. Jeremy will speak to our insurance engine in just a moment and his team continue to be hard at the task of understanding and quantifying areas of weakness as well as strengths and taking the necessary steps to improve results. We have made several significant management changes in the past year and taking actions such as withdrawing or reducing certain lines of business, reducing line sizes, increasing accountability, modifying incentive compensation arrangements, increasing the scope and scale for some of the proven winners in our insurance operations and decreasing or eliminating pockets with disappointing performance. The transition year of 2023 produced results well below our expectations, but I am confident that we have recognized the pieces of our insurance engine where we needed to make changes and that we are taking appropriate steps to make things better. Many areas in insurance produced wonderful results of which we should all be proud. Those results were offset and obscured by certain limited but meaningful pockets of underperformance. As such, the aggregate combined ratio came in higher than our original plans. Fortunately, while we did experience adverse development in the fourth quarter, we did indeed have positive development \u2013 redundant development for the full year. We always operate with the core belief that we will always set our reserves at levels that we believe will prove to be more likely redundant than deficient. I am proud of our insurance team and that despite the difficult year we continue to live up to the standard of integrity and discipline in setting loss reserves. We have done so for years. We will continue to hold to that standard going forward. Jeremy will provide more details on the insurance results of 2023 in his comments. I also want to reinforce that the changes we made in 2023 and those that we continue to refine in 2024 and beyond will take time to show up in the financial statements. Every decision or action that we take in insurance takes at least a year to fully flow through our financial statements. We look forward to reporting better results in future periods as the actions we have taken take hold. Turning to some more positive and fun things to talk about, in 2023, we earned excellent results in our ventures and investment operations. Recurring investment income from dividends and interest rose 64% from $447 million to $735 million in 2023. Every engine at the Markel Group continued to produce cash and that cash, along with maturities from our bonds portfolio, was invested in higher yielding fixed income instruments. Dividend income also rose due to net purchases in the equity portfolio and dividend increases. I think you can expect this positive trend to continue in 2024 with interest rates at current levels. We also repurchased 322,000 Markel Group shares in 2023 for $445 million compared to 233,000 shares for $291 million in 2022. Share repurchases continue to be a high priority use of capital for us at current prices. In our Markel Ventures operations, top line revenues grew 5% from $4.8 billion to just a smidge under $5 billion. More importantly, operating income rose 35% from $325 million to $438 million and EBITDA rose 24% from $506 million to $628 million. We did not make any new platform acquisitions in 2023. We were able to add to our VSC operations and increase our ownership stake in certain situations. We also completed an acquisition at Costa just after January 1 that will add to our 2024 results. We remain disciplined and thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions and it is exciting to see our existing businesses find ways to grow. This is simply a phenomenal performance by the Ventures team. It reflects the ongoing maturity and development of the Markel Ventures businesses. I could not be more proud of the team from top to bottom as they continue to produce excellent results and do so in the context of the values of the Markel style. In our investment operations, we purchased over $300 million net of publicly traded equities, which met our longstanding four-part investment tests. We earned a total equity return of 21.6% during the year and I am happy with those results. They were produced with our discipline fully intact. Among other things, the unrealized gain on our equity portfolio now stands at over $6 billion pre-tax. I am not aware of many companies that enjoy a position such as that. Thank you all for your longstanding support of the Markel Group. I share your disappointment in some of the results within our insurance engine, and I am confident that we are taking appropriate and necessary steps to improve those results. Meanwhile, given our diversification of the three-engine system and our excellent results at Ventures and positive investment results, we are making good economic progress at the Markel Group. While we continue to deemphasize book value per share as the sole describer of economic progress around here, it's probably worth noting that book value per share went up over 17% in 2023. In the last 5 years that it has increased to the compound annual growth rate of 11% despite what we have described as some of the most challenging circumstances we have ever experienced. I am deeply optimistic that we are on track and make progress in 2024 and beyond. With that, I will turn it over to Brian to update you on the 2023 numbers and then to Jeremy for his review of our insurance operations. Following Jeremy's comments, we will open the floor for questions. Brian? Thank you, Jeremy. And Auger [ph] we will open the floor for questions, if you'd be so kind. Yes, Mark, it's Tom. Better No. Let's get better and then we will talk about it. And let me jump in. This is Tom. And Mark, and this is really for everybody. I want to make sure we're not driving by looking at the hood ornament. And we keep our eyes on the horizon a bit here. So obviously, we're talking a lot about the insurance results.

            "name": "Brian Costanzo",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. I am happy to be with you all this morning to discuss our 2023 results. As Tom mentioned, 2023 illustrated the diversity of our three-engine system. While our combined ratio result for the year is disappointing, our ventures and investment engines had terrific years with EBITDA from Markel Ventures, the value of our investments and our net investment income hitting record highs. With that, let's jump into the results. Starting out with our consolidated results. We reported net income to common shareholders of $2 billion in 2023 versus the net loss to common shareholders of $253 million in 2022, with the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders in 2023 was $2.3 billion versus a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.2 billion in 2022, driven most notably by the favorable swings in our fixed maturity and public equity portfolios. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.8 billion in 2023 versus $2.7 billion in 2022, reflecting strong cash flows from each of our three operating engines. Total shareholders' equity stood at $15 billion at the end of 2023. As Tom mentioned earlier, we repurchased $445 million of Markel Group common stock this year under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $291 million last year. Turning over to our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew 4% to $10.3 billion in 2023 compared to $9.8 billion in 2022, reflecting new business and more favorable rates across many product lines within our insurance segment, most notably our personal and property product lines. We saw lower premium volume within select domestic professional liability and general liability product lines where we adjusted writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes in particular within public D&O. Our consolidated combined ratio was 98% in 2023 versus 92% in 2022. The increase in the combined ratio was primarily driven by higher attritional loss ratios in 2023 on our general liability and professional liability product lines within our insurance segment in reaction to increasing estimates of future loss cost trends. Prior year losses developed favorably by $39 million in 2023 versus $167 million in 2022. We experienced meaningful favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in 2023, most notably within our international professional liability products and our global property and marine and energy product lines within the insurance segment. This favorable development was largely offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines across both underwriting segments and adverse development on a discontinued portion of our public entity product line within our Reinsurance segment. Jeremy will provide more insight on our loss development experience during his comments. Moving to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $735 million in 2023 versus $447 million last year, a 64% increase as we reinvested maturing securities in our fixed income portfolio at higher interest rates. The total size of our fixed income portfolio also grew in alignment with our growth in reserves given we generally match our insurance liabilities with highly rated fixed income securities of similar duration and currency. The largest contributor to our increase in net investment income is related to our cash and cash equivalents, where we have increased our allocation to money market funds to take advantage of the current interest rate environment. Net investment gains of $1.5 billion in 2023 reflect favorable market value movements driving a return of 21.6% on our public equity portfolio during the year. This compares to net investment losses of $1.6 billion in 2022. As you have heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. At the end of 2023, the fair value of our equity portfolio included pre-tax cumulative unrealized holding gains of $6.1 billion. Net unrealized investment gains included in other comprehensive income in 2023 were $307 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment losses of $1.2 billion net of taxes in 2022. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our bond investments until maturity and we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. The cumulative amount of pre-tax unrealized losses on our bond portfolio was $560 million as of the end of 2023. We continue our longstanding practice of investing in the highest quality fixed income securities. As of December 31, 97% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, moving over to our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 5% to just under $5 billion for 2023, up from $4.8 billion last year, reflecting higher prices and increased demand across several businesses, most notably within our construction services and equipment manufacturing businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 24% to a record high of $628 million in 2023, up from $506 million in 2022. The increase was driven by increases in most all of our products businesses within the consumer and building products, equipment manufacturing and transportation areas driven by increased revenues and higher margins in 2023 versus 2022 as material and freight costs stabilized this year. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to further discuss our insurance engine."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. As Tom and Brian alluded to, we experienced mixed results within our insurance operations in 2023. An overall 98% combined ratio for the year is disappointing and below our long-term goals. I assume the reins of our insurance platform last year and the reality is that 2023 was not the year I anticipated. I think it's important for me to take a few minutes and explain what's happened, what we are doing about it as well as to highlight what is going well. Our result for the year was heavily influenced by the recent loss trends within select product lines within our North American casualty and professional liability books and to a lesser extent, some tough lessons within our intellectual property CPI product line. Before I touch upon the adverse development this quarter, let me first highlight some of the best performing parts of our business. Our International division had an outstanding year in 2023, achieving both double-digit top line growth and a combined ratio below 90. Our international team's portfolio management over the last few years is starting to show in the results. In 2023, we expanded our international operations into Australia and within Europe. We added to our product capabilities, further diversifying and growing our platform. We see more opportunities to grow internationally in the years ahead. Both of our non-underwriting businesses, State National and Nephila had fantastic years. State National continues to grow, maintain exemplary discipline around reinsurer credit management and produce exceptional operating margins. Nephila demonstrated itself as a market leader, delivering high-quality data and insight-driven portfolio construction, while deploying innovative strategies to maximize returns for investors. Through meaningful improvements in pricing adequacy in the property cat market, Nephila is well positioned going into 2024 and beyond. Note, some of how Markel participates in the recent property market improvements, occur outside of our reported combined ratio and are reflected in our results at Nephila. Together, our ongoing fronting and ILS operations, excluding the impacts of gains on the disposition of subsidiaries in both years, contributed operating income before amortization of $146 million in 2023, up almost 40% from a year ago. We were excited to announce the formation of State National global platform during the quarter. We look forward to continued growth and profitability in these business units. Further, we will continue to deploy our world class insurance platforms across underwriting, fronting and ILS to maximize returns for Markel Group. Our global reinsurance operations reported a disappointing combined ratio for the year, much of that related to adverse development within our reinsurance casualty lines in the years before 2020. As discussed in recent quarters, we undertook meaningful changes regarding our appetite and approach to portfolio management. We are focused on improved long-term profitability. We have a refreshed reinsurance leadership team and portfolio and we feel very good about where we stand today in that business. Finally, while our Specialty division has faced challenges within portions of our casualty and professional liability lines, meaningful segments of our specialty portfolio are performing well. For example, our property in marine, small commercial, personal lines and surety product lines, all had outstanding years, achieving double-digit growth and combined ratios at or well below our 2023 targets. Together, these product lines alone represent about $3 billion in annual gross written premium volume. The growth in these classes and several other segments of our business demonstrates our strong core. These business units are well established and poised to produce solid underwriting results in the future. Turning back to our domestic casualty and professional liability insurance portfolios. We have been challenged by the market dynamics within the contractor segments of our brokerage access in umbrella and primary general liability lines in casualties and our risk-managed E&O and D&O lines in professional liability. This includes all of the factors driving a loss cost trends that we have discussed in previous quarters and are widely reported across the industry, including social and economic inflation and litigation financing trends. We have meaningfully increased our prior accident year loss reserves in these specific lines throughout the latter half of 2022 and during 2023 to respond to these emerging loss trends. However, as the year progressed and the loss trends continue to deteriorate, it became clear that we needed to take a more focused review of our portfolios to better understand the underlying dynamics and causes of the adverse loss development trends. In doing so, we would ensure we are maintaining healthy portfolios with sufficient rate adequacy as we move forward. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we conducted an extensive loss review of these lines and took meaningful action to put these prior year development trends behind us. While we can never have absolute certainty that there will be no further development within these portfolios, we are confident that with the additional actions we took in the quarter, we have created an even greater level of resiliency in our balance sheet, consistent with our long-held conservative reserving philosophy. Our overall casualty book is concentrated in construction business. Through our review, we determined the construction defect claims within our casualty construction portfolio and the longer reporting tail than originally anticipated. Average claim severity also continues to increase in this line due to the various forms of inflation we mentioned. Consequently, the business is not as profitable as we thought when we originally wrote it. We also determined that there was a greater propensity within our access and umbrella general liability and risk-managed E&O professional books of limits below our attachment point being eroded, pushing more claims into our layers. Further, reporting of these claims has lagged historical development patterns due to the effects of court closures and claim backlogs, stemming from the COVID pandemic, aggressive tactics by the plaintiff bar and slow claim reporting trends. Considering these factors, we also added significant reserves to our casualty lines within our Reinsurance segment in accident years 2019 and prior. These trends have been observable within our incurred loss development in accident years prior to 2020. Since that time, we have achieved significant rate increases across many of these classes and have taken a variety of underwriting actions. While these actions have significantly improved the profitability of these lines, we also added to reserves to our 2021 and 2022 accident years in the fourth quarter. We did this recognizing that the difference between loss ratios prior to the pandemic and post pandemic had reached a differential that did not feel consistent with our conservative approach to reserving and the ultimate cost to settle the claims on more recent years may prove to be higher than we initially anticipated. We had already adjusted our 2023 accident year attritional loss ratios at the beginning of the year in reaction to concerns around increasing loss trends. Given the most recent accident years are green, we feel it best to ensure we are maintaining an appropriate margin of safety to reduce the likelihood of future adverse development. That being said, there is a lot of uncertainty associated with reserving long-tailed lines of business that won't be settled for many years to come. Most of our reserves in these product lines are held in IBNR, particularly in the more recent years. In fact, as of year-end 2023, 70% of our total reserves are in IBNR, up from 67% at the end of 2022 and 63% 5 years ago. Despite these challenges, it's important to note we did have favorable development for the full year 2023. We continue to operate with a core belief that we should set reserves at a level that will prove more likely redundant than deficient. We remain committed to the principle and hope you take some comfort in the fact that it remains true for the full year 2023 despite the challenges we faced. Now let me touch on what we're doing going into 2024. We will carry our positive momentum into the year from our International, State National and Nephila businesses and our specialty product lines. We are looking to use our power of the platform to create opportunities for growth. Regarding our casualty construction and risk managed professional liability lines, we are actively managing these portfolios. We've made changes to personnel. We will be exiting unprofitable classes in subsegments. We will reduce excessive concentrations in order to ensure our optimal portfolio balance, and we will be appropriately adjusting rates, terms and conditions, limits, attachment points and other factors. We are confident in our ability to re-underwrite these products back to levels of profitability we aspire to. We've done it before. We are determined to do it again. But these actions will take some time to earn their way through the results. Just a couple of comments on the pricing environment. It continues to be the case that each product area and region of the world has its own story. But broadly speaking, rates are continuing to hold up fairly well. By and large, are keeping up with and in some cases, are slightly ahead of our view of trend. We had many products where rates are up 5% to 10% and for most casualty product lines, and particularly of rate adequacy is in question, we are seeing success pushing for rate. Within our property offering, the pricing environment remains attractive. And while we expect increases to moderate in \u201824, the environment is constructive with healthy margins and anticipated returns on capital. Professional liability remains challenging from a pricing standpoint. While the rate of pricing declines on public D&O business have moderated, we remain very cautious with regards to current levels of rate adequacy and are managing our portfolio and exposures accordingly. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom. Yes. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things. First off, with regards to both our general liability and professional liability portfolios, there is a lot of business within those portfolios. And actually, some of the segments within them, if we look at casualty and we think about environmental, if we think about healthcare, we think about our binding operations, they are performing very well. In professional, if we think about commercial D&O and E&O is performing very well, financial advisers. So we have segments within those portfolios that we can continue to grow internationally as well on both the casualty and professional side. So pockets of the portfolio, we are growing. We can continue to grow. They are meeting our profitability targets in the classes that are more challenged in that space, even in the fourth quarter alone, we shed over $100 million of premium in those classes and still sort of grew our top line within the insurance results. So we are remixing the portfolio. We've seen and reported over the last \u2013 over the course of 2023, a more moderated pace of top line growth. And we're focused on bottom line profitability that may continue to be the case, and we will continue to remix the portfolio. But we've been doing some of that already. As far as changes in underwriting, practices, if you will, we really are taking a very targeted view within each of our product areas and it's a tailored approach with regards to what we're doing. So we have some classes. That are all in segments within our portfolios that we're going to exit or we have exited altogether. We've got areas where we will take subclasses or sub-segments and reduce our writings. Clearly, we will push rate. Clearly, we will address wordings in terms and conditions. We're looking at attachment points. We're looking at limits profiles. We're looking at geography mix. A lot of what we're doing is going to be about portfolio balance and overall portfolio management. So a lot that's happening across the insurance operation right now. Yes, more difficult to talk about a trend. As Tom mentioned, it takes a while for things to earn through in insurance, right? So heading into a year, the portfolio an earned premium basis is already sort of on risk and working its way through. So any actions that we have taken recently or we take here shortly, it will take a little while to earn through. That being said, everything that we are doing right now is focused on being accretive to earnings as we move forward. So I expect that over time, what we will see is an improved profitability and improved margins on the current portfolio. That's in the loss ratio. Well, I think that the part associated with the lengthening of the tail is a bit specific to the construction defect portion within our contractors on both the primary and excess basis. So that's a pretty specific point there. With regards to the effects more widely around inflation, be it economic inflation or social inflation, that happens across, particularly in U.S. logs. That happens in a number of areas as we've been talking about. But again, more pronounced in the general liability and professional liability lines that we've been speaking to over the course of the year. We will see sort of obviously have the year trends in development, and we very much have the intention in those pockets, particularly in the casualty that I'm mentioning the rate is needed, and we've had success in pushing rate. I don't think we get all the way there overnight. And I think it has to be something that is sustained. I also don't think that, that is unique to sort of Markel circumstances. I think casualty is getting a lot of coverage around the sort of trends and the pervasive nature of social inflation and some of what we've experienced ourselves, I think, is being shared in the industry. So I would expect that it will continue to be \u2013 will continue to be the opportunity to push on rate within casualty lines in \u201824. Yes. I mean, look, inflation is a component as a broad statement, Mark. But what I would suggest is that in the fourth quarter, we really took a far more extensive review, right? And we got our leaders across underwriting and claims and actuarial. We aided ourselves with third-party experts gaining insights and broader industry data for purposes of comparability, and we did a much more data-intensive exercise. So we are doing a deeper review into our underlying books and trends to get better insights around the causes of the adverse development. So as a kind of an example, Ron mentioned, we start segmenting out our contractors portions of our books. We then further segment construction defect claims trends and data from non-construction defect. We looked at practice exposures versus project exposures. We looked at wording, claims handling practices, various assumptions we're making. So, all that to give you a sense of the depth and the robustness of the review that we had. Undoubtedly, the rising level of cost to settle and adjust claims is linked to inflation in all exports. So we're seeing that. But there are other aspects that give us that led to some of the reserve adjustments we made in the fourth quarter, but also, I think, importantly, lead us to have a lot more confidence that we understand the recent experience and that we're in a position now to put that adverse loss experience and trend behind us as we move forward. Sure. So, I mean as far as sort of trend assumptions heading into \u201824, I think if anything, trend either holds up or moderate slightly, relative to \u201823 assumptions. We have a very broad portfolio. We are 100 major product lines. We write lots of different segments and classes all across the globe. So, there is no sort of simple way to break through the trend assumptions down. But in \u2013 as you would expect in longer tail cash-driven oriented lines, 5%, 6% to 8% is not an uncommon trend assumption. And in each of the cases, we look at our portfolios with regards to rate adequacy. We look at the pricing that we are obtaining relative to that trend. And we all level that into our loss selections. We have not done anything with regards to LPT or adverse development covers, and I won't sort of comment more broadly than that. Generally speaking, I think a lot of what we have been talking about in our challenge with regards to recent social inflation trends. So, the cost to adjust and settle claims, prevalence of litigation funding, the aggressiveness of the plaintiffs for the sentiment of juries, all those sort of things, I don't necessarily have a reason to believe that, that abates anytime in the near-term. So, what we have to do is appropriately price our portfolio and ensure that we have got enough diversification and resiliency in the portfolios to stay a step ahead. And that's part of what mentioning the fact that we have taken a more cautious view on the more recent years to build in to attempt to build in a greater margin of safety around those concerns in line with our core philosophy of being more likely redundant than deficient. So, we will see how that plays out. But we have to be cautious in the sort of claims and litigation environment. It's a mix. So, we had an example within reinsurance that Brian alluded to, it's associated with public entity business that we wrote in 2019 and prior that we discontinued at that time. We have aspects of our portfolio that are ongoing that we are trimming and rehabbing and trying to get right. We have got aspects within the portfolio that we are exiting either classes or sub-segments. So, I mean it's a bit of everything across the portfolio. Yes. I mean I can't put any specifics or quantification around that. I gave you an example earlier to say, suggest in the fourth quarter and some of the lines at a larger sort of product line level that we shed over $100 million of premium in those lines that were more challenged where we were concerned about rate adequacy. And obviously, we grew more than that across everything else in the portfolio. We will continue to do that. So, we are focused within every facet of our insurance operations of ensuring that we are \u2013 have a healthy portfolio. That it's rate adequate and that we are earning appropriate returns on capital. And I will report to you each and every 90 days of how we are making progress in that space. But I can't sort of simplistically say, this is how it will break down. We are working hard. It is a mix across the various segments of our portfolio where we are growing. So, I had mentioned personal lines. I mentioned property, inland marine, programs business, our binding operations, workers' comp, surety, a number of lines in our professional space. So, you have got U.S., you have got international, you have got alternative retail and wholesale or admitted and non-admitted business, it's a mix. But in the spaces like, for example, property, marine, personal lines, those will be more weighted towards E&S binding, more weighted towards E&S. Yes. Thanks for the question. I don't believe that that's the case. The \u2013 when we talked about 1051 is an idea within our global insurance operations. It's roughly to suggest what would need to be true if we were to aspire to double the size of our insurance platform at that time across all facets and do so at a level that was contributing meaningfully to the bottom line profits. The suggested growth rate there really isn't different than the growth rate that we had experienced over the past several decades as an organization. So, I don't think that, that put an unhealthy expectation around growth. I do think linked to that, we said what would need to be true with regards to product, talent, technology, to data, to geography, to various offerings, our trading relationships. So, there are a lot of aspects of what would need to be true to be that sort of insurance organization. And we continue to work very hard at building out the breadth of specialization and diversification across the platform. I think you will have gotten a sense from the call today. There is a lot of things that we have done, and we have done very well. Fortunately, there are some things that have come back over the course of 10 years. I mean a lot of the \u201819 and prior, that portfolio already existed prior to us making reference to 10.51 objective. We could not have contemplated at that time a pandemic and how sort of inflation, what would occur on the inflation side, both social and economic. So, the world moved out a little bit since we had that target. But our idea is around what we aspire to be and being ambitious as an organization to be better for our customers, to be better for our employees to create winning outcomes for our shareholders, those ideas remain. Yes, that's a good point, Charlie. So, in the fourth quarter, the increase in reserves that we took, particularly in the general liability space within our Reinsurance segment was not driven by underlying ceding reporting and incurred activity, but more so in part because of the findings and observations that we had within our insurance book and in contemplation of the risk that some of those things could exist within the underlying ceding reporting and incurred loss activity in time. So, again, I would say that was kind of a cautious approach to ensure that we are building an appropriate margin of safety be more likely redundant than deficient within the reinsurance book versus specific claims reporting activity in the period. Yes. I think you are thinking about it right. There was \u2013 there is definitely some noise like you said. The intellectual property CPI and the credit losses we experienced there, specific banking losses we recognized in the first quarter, those sort of one-offs did contribute between one or two points to that trend. And then clearly, as we talked about throughout the year, higher attritional loss ratios across the cash, the general liability and professional liability lines being another driver. That's right."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Regina, good morning, and welcome to the Markel Group third quarter conference call for 2023. My name is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined this morning by Teri Gendron, the Chief Financial Officer; and Jeremy Noble, the President of Insurance to brief you on our results as well as to answer your thoughtful questions. At Markel Group, we remain committed to our long-term goal of building one of the world's great companies. We define that as creating a win, win, win culture, where our customers are better off for having done business with us. Our colleagues are better off by being part of the Markel Group and our shareholders are in excellent returns on their capital as a result of the wins by customers and colleagues. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of the Markel Group through the first nine months of 2023. But we do have a few blemishes to deal with this year. As always, we will be honest and candid in sharing not only what's working well, but what needs improvement. We believe that this honest and candid self-assessment is the best way to maintain the discipline and clear headedness needed to make good decisions going forward. It is also the way to earn your trust as we demonstrate to you that we acknowledge our challenges and face them head on. Teri will provide you with the detailed numbers in just a minute, and Jeremy will follow with his report on our insurance operations. But before we get to that, I wanted to start off with some high level commentary. As Sheryl Crow saying, every day is a winding road. She's right. We've got some great news, some good news and some challenging news this quarter. While we may be on a winding road, we do continue to move forward. As to the great news, Markel Ventures continues to produce simply outstanding results. For the first nine months of this year, operating income rose 52% from $217 million to $330 million. And EBITDA rose 35% from $353 million to $474 million. There were no material acquisitions at ventures during this time period. These are basically apple sauce to apple sauce numbers. I simply could not be more pleased with the performance of Ventures. The management teams that lead those companies continue to produce outstanding results for the Markel Group. The numbers speak for themselves. As to the good news, and is very good. Our recurring interest and dividend income grew 73% from $302 million to $521 million in the first nine months of 2023. We continue to invest the cash flows and maturing bonds into higher-yielding fixed income securities. Each investment we make in fixed income these days carries a higher interest rate than the bonds that are maturing. And would expect us to continue to earn even higher amounts of recurring investment income in the prevailing interest rate environment. As to our equity investment portfolio, we earned a return of 9.3% through the first nine months of 2023. While this trails the S&P return of 13.1%, we do remain over 100 basis points ahead of the S&P for more than 30 years. I would very happily sign up for the sort of annualized investment results we are putting up so far in 2023. I'd also happily accept 100 basis points of outperformance for the next three decades, if I could do so. As to the challenging news in our insurance operations, we reported a year-to-date combined ratio of 95%. And for the third quarter, we reported a combined ratio of 99%. These results are below our expectations and stem from multiple factors. First, we continue to experience inflation in our claims payments. That inflation reflects higher overall price levels and social inflation that we see in the current legal environment. We continue to incorporate these trends in our reserve setting process. I'm pleased to report to you that despite the challenges, we continue to live up to our goal of setting reserves that prove to be more likely to be redundant and deficient. We did report favorable development in the third quarter. Some of the factors that led to these results include two points of losses in the third quarter from natural catastrophes, including Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. Additionally, we experienced approximately three points of losses in the third quarter from the losses in our collateral protection book, which include exposure to the widely reported vest two bankruptcy and fraud case. Collateral protection is a relatively new product to us and to the marketplace. We learned some tough lessons here, and we've made significant adjustments to the product. While we are extremely disappointed with this loss, we believe we've addressed the causes aggressively. And we are actively working to mitigate potential future losses associated with this product. We are especially disappointed with these particular losses as they obscure the outstanding performance from so many other components of our insurance operations. Rest assured, we continue to work tirelessly to make each engine in the Markel Group performed at the highest levels. And we look forward to future periods of sharing our progress on exactly that with you. We never like calling out specific reasons for our disappointing results. Discussions of natural catastrophes and headline events can deteriorate into an exercise of excuse making. I don't like making excuses any more than you like hearing them. We know that you as shareholders expect us to be able to manage the normal flow of catastrophe losses headline events of wars, consequences of climate change and other things that go bump in the night and still produce acceptable results. That is the very nature of what a successful insurance operation does. We understand the assignment. Rest assured, we continue to work tirelessly, to make each engine in the Markel Group performed at the highest levels, and we look forward to future periods of sharing our progress on exactly that with you. Finally, as one additional marker of our overall financial strength and performance, we invested $270 million in additional public equity investments during the first nine months, which should produce additional returns into the future. The current unrealized gain on our public equity portfolio stands at over $5 billion. I expect that amount to continue to grow over time. We also repurchased $269 million of our own stock so far in 2023 compared with $208 million in the first nine months of last year. My expectation is that we'll continue to produce profitable results in our insurance ventures and investment engines and we will be dividing those profits among future shares -- fewer shares. That seems like a recipe for increasing shareholder value to me. Additionally, I stated last quarter, that in five of the last six quarters, I've personally taken money out of my pocket to buy Markel Group stock on the open market. I continue to do so again during the past quarter. In fact, I invested approximately my entire after-tax salary for Markel Group during the quarter to purchase shares in the open market. At this point, I now have purchased Markel Group shares in six of the last seven quarters. I am confident in our team, I believe in their talent and dedication. I believe they will produce excellent results. We remain committed to building one of the world's great companies, and I thank you for your ongoing support. With that, I'll turn it over to Teri to provide you some of the details of our financial results. Jeremy will pick up with his comments on our insurance engine, and then we'll open the floor for questions. Teri?\nTeri Gendron: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom pointed out, we have a mix of results this quarter, which highlights the importance of our three engine architecture. Using the words of Sheryl Crow, the diversity in our family of business may be helping us to get a little bit closer to feeling fine. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums grew 5% to $7.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to $7.5 billion in 2022. Our increased premium volume reflects new business and more favorable rates across many of the product launches within our insurance segment. Partially offset by lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines where we're adjusting our writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2023 was 95% compared to 91% for the same period last year. Our 2023 combined ratio included $46 million or one point of net losses attributed to the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. Our 2022 combined ratio included $70 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian and $35 million attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which together added two points to the combined ratio. Excluding these losses from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of '23, was 95% compared to 89% in 2022. The increase was driven by a higher attritional loss ratio in 2023 within our insurance segment, which Jeremy will discuss further. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $170 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $204 million in the first nine months of 2022. We experienced favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in '23. Most notably across our international professional liability product lines and our property product lines within the insurance segment. The favorable development in 2023 was partially offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines within our insurance segment due to an increased frequency of large claims over the past several quarters under excess an umbrella and primary casualty contractors liability products. We also experienced adverse development within our Reinsurance segment in 2023 on our general liability product lines and a discontinued portion of our public entity product line. Turning to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $521 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $302 million in the same period last year. With meaningful increases from fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on our fixed maturity securities reflects a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. On a year-to-date basis, yields on our purchases of fixed maturities have been about 250 basis points higher than securities that rolled off. Higher income from short-term investments is due to higher short-term interest rates in the current year. The largest share of the increase is due to higher interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, as we have increased our allocation to money market funds to take advantage of the current interest rate environment. During the first nine months of 2023, we recognized net unrealized investment losses with an other comprehensive loss of $135 million net of taxes, compared to net unrealized investment losses of $1.3 billion, net effect in 2022. These movements correspond to decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature. And we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods if bonds mature. As of September 30th, over 99% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Net investment gains of $591 million for the first nine months of '23, reflect favorable market value movements driving a return of 9.3% on our public equity portfolio during the period. This compares to net investment losses of $2.2 billion for the same period of 2022. As you heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. With regard to our Markel Ventures segment, revenues from Markel Ventures increased 6% to $3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023, up from $3.5 billion for the first nine months of last year. The increase reflects growth and improved pricing across several of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 35% to $474 million for the first nine months of 2023. From $353 million during the same period last year. The increase was driven by our products businesses, which had higher margins in '23, compared to '22, as we saw material and freight costs stabilize. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 21% compared to 23% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $926 million in the same period a year ago. With the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months of 2023 was $1.1 billion compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, with swings in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as the largest drivers. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to $1.9 billion for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most significant contribution from our insurance engine and a notable year-over-year increase coming from our Markel Ventures engine. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of September compared to $13.2 million at the end of the year. Overall, we're pleased with our consolidated results so far this year and are confident that we're taking the right steps to address the current challenges on our road to building long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to discuss our insurance engine results for the third quarter. Clearly, our insurance operations performance is not where we want it to be. However, I am confident that we are taking the right actions quickly in the near term to successfully confront what are predominantly industry-wide challenges that set Markel up for long-term success. As I walk you through our financials, you will see our performance is being impacted by a few pockets within our product portfolio that are negatively influencing our underwriting results for the period. This includes the well-documented higher loss cost trends in recent years, which are creating prior adverse reserve development within our risk managed D&O and excess casualty lines, and mid-market excess an umbrella in primary casualty contractors liability books. We are working incredibly hard to evaluate the ultimate cost to set on claims on these meaningful portfolios, examining the maturing accident years from the last soft market cycle, while seeking to gain confidence around margins on more recent accident years that were written in a more favorable market environment. We are also maintaining a higher level of prudence on our current accident year loss picks within these products due to the uncertainty around future loss cost trends. We are acting with a great deal of discipline being more selective around new business, pushing rates and terms and letting business laps that doesn't meet our profitability targets. We are in the process of remixing our portfolio to improve overall profitability. And ensuring our reserves are robust as we move into 2024. In short, Markel has long been a conservative company and one that demonstrates caution when it comes to evaluating adverse claims trends. Let me now share a few further thoughts on our results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which includes our insurance and reinsurance, State National program services and the fill insurance-linked securities operations. Across all of our businesses within the insurance engine, through three quarters, we have produced $6.3 billion in revenues, up 8% from last year, while generating pretax operating income of $371 million. The insurance engine also continues to generate significant operating cash flows, and we have been intentional about taking the cash and maximizing the investment return on the float generated by our underwriting operations and attractive market yields. Moving to the results of our underwriting operations. We reported a combined ratio of 99% in the third quarter results, which was significantly influenced by several noteworthy items. Three, to be exact. First, we realized a total of $46 million or two points of losses in the quarter related to catastrophe events, specifically the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. The losses concentrated in our small commercial inland marine and binding property lines. We also recognized $30 million or just under two points of development on the prior accident year losses within a runoff portion of our public entity line in reinsurance. We exited this segment of reinsuring not-for-profit entities in California and other West Coast-based states in 2020, recognizing that this book was not performing adequately. We now believe the ultimate losses from this book are likely need to be greater than what we had previously allowed before. Based on a recent completion of an actuary and claims review. Finally, we recognized losses in the quarter within our intellectual property collateral protection product line, including a $25 million or one point impact to the combined ratio from credit losses related to a fraudulent letter of credit provided by Best 2. Our CPI product in total had a three point impact on our combined ratio. If you exclude these three items, our reported combined ratio of 99% in the quarter converts to 93%, consistent with our result for the first half of this year. This highlights the fact that we have many product lines within our portfolio that are performing very well. Turning to premium production. Overall, gross written premiums in our underwriting operations grew by 1% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. As I pointed out last quarter, we continued to achieve premium growth in lines where we see opportunities and feel good about the levels of rate adequacy. We are taking advantage of the improved pricing environment and have achieved strong growth in our property, in the marine, binding, personal loans and select marine and energy classes internationally as well as regional growth in our U.K., European and Asian operations. Just as important, we continue to reduce writings in certain classes where we are seeing unacceptable rate decreases relative to loss cost trends. Within our professional liability lines, this is the most notable in the large account public D&O space. We've also decreased writings in our intellectual property collateral protection line as part of our re-underwriting effort in that product. Our professional lines writings have also been impacted by changes in the broader economy, including the slowdown in M&A and public listings, which is impacting premium volume within our transaction liability product line within both our insurance and reinsurance segments. In other professional classes, in particular, within our international portfolio, we are pursuing growth opportunities where we find the business to be adequately priced, although growth has moderated over the course of 2023. Within our general liability product lines, we are seeing solid rate increases overall and achieving moderate opportunistic growth. For example, we are increasing our writings in our finding casualty and environmental lines, which have been consistently profitable. Conversely, we are contracting premiums in our primary casualty contractors liability and excess and umbrella lines where loss costs have been more challenging, and we are carefully selecting risks, pushing rate, managing limits and attachment points to combat these trends. Our year-to-date consolidated combined ratio of 95% for the first nine months of the year is up four points from a year ago. This increase is driven by the items I just discussed earlier, impacting the third quarter results along with the impact from higher attritional loss ratios in our professional liability and general liability product lines and slightly lower overall prior accident year loss takedowns largely driven by our general liability lines. With respect to the increases in our current accident year loss ratio, we remain cautious in recognizing the benefits from our product diversification and re-underwriting strategies within our general liability and professional liability product losses. We are choosing to increase the confidence level in our loss picks to reflect the higher loss cost trends we are seeing in prior accident years and the uncertainty around the economic and claims environment that will exist in the future when we ultimately settle claims on these long tail lines. We also continue to maintain a cautious approach to recognizing prior accident year loss takedowns. We recognized $170 million or three points of prior accident year loss takedowns through the first nine months of the year, down slightly from a year ago. As I've stated in prior quarters, our loss reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to hold loss reserves at levels that are more likely to prove redundant than deficient. And we are reacting quickly by recognizing additional loss reserves and loss trends outpaced previously held expectations. One final comment to make relative to our underwriting results with respect to our Reinsurance segment where we produced a combined ratio of 102% in the quarter. While this result is disappointing, it should be noted that the prior accident year was adverse development in the runoff segment of our public entity book added 11 points to the third quarter Reinsurance segment combined ratio. Excluding this development, our reinsurance result is more aligned with our long-term underwriting targets. We have worked hard in the past two years to re-underwrite our reinsurance treaty mix and return our reinsurance results to profitability. We remain confident that over the long-term, we will see positive and sustainable impact of those efforts materialize in our results. Next, I'll quickly touch on the two portions of our business that are reported as part of our other operations, our program services and other fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $3 billion year-to-date versus $2.6 billion a year ago, resulting in an increase in operating revenues of 2% for the first nine months of the year due to expansion of existing programs and addition of new programs. Our State National team continues to perform extremely well producing consistent profitability and continuing to pursue opportunities within our business development pipeline. Within our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations, revenues and expenses for the first nine months of the year were down due to the impact of the sale of our MGA operations in 2022. Revenues within our fund management operations are up from last year due to revenues recognized during the third quarter of this year of $30 million related to the release of capital that had been trapped in side pockets. Our assets under management in Nephila up $6.8 billion is down from a year ago, due to the redemption of side pocket classes in the quarter, which outpaced profits generated from the funds year-to-date. However, the current pricing environment for catastrophe-exposed property risk has created a very attractive return proposition for investors. The platform has produced profitable results for the year. The team is working very hard to capitalize on these market opportunities, focusing on price transparency and portfolio construction. At this time, we feel very well positioned heading into 2024. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities remain robust outside of professional lines, which continue to be impacted by less M&A activity and an unfavorable pricing environment. Overall, trends within the specialty insurance marketplace remains strong. Just a few comments on rate across our portfolio. Throughout 2023, we have achieved modest rate increases across the landscape of our diversified product portfolio. In the current pricing environment, rate trends are more divergent by product class in contrast in the past few years. Pricing seems to be keeping pace with or staying slightly ahead of trend. We are achieving significant rate increases in our property coverages in select marine and energy product lines due to the recent industry loss experience and increasing cost of obtaining reinsurance protection, Additionally, within our general liability product lines, we continue to achieve modest rate increases across most product classes and have seen the level of increases improve over the course of the year. Within our insurance and reinsurance professional liability product lines, we have seen modest rate decreases overall, driven by notable decreases within our public directors and officers product consistent with the broader trends across the industry and to a lesser extent within our errors and emissions coverages. In other professional product liability product lines, particularly within our international portfolio, we are generally seeing consistency in rates. And are continuing to pursue growth opportunities where we find the business to be adequately priced. We're also seeing moderate rate decreases globally within our cyber product line in response to several years of significant rate increases and strong industry underwriting performance. Despite these current trends, we view cyber as a long-term growth opportunity. Finally, we continue to realize low single-digit rate decreases within our workers' compensation product line and are reacting accordingly on a state-by-state basis to maintain profitability. In closing, our focus as a business unit remains on achieving long-term profitable growth across our insurance platform. We have numerous success stories to celebrate across our diversified portfolio of doing just that. Reinsurance market conditions are favorable, and we are taking advantage of this within our operations. Our State National business continues its track record of consistent profitable performance. And Nephila, we are seeing strong returns thus far this year within our portfolios, opening the door to future growth opportunities. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. And with that, Regina, if you would please be so kind as to open the floor for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yes, thank you and good morning.\nThomas Gayner: Good morning.\nMark Hughes: In the contractor book with the GL line, I think you described some challenges there. How long is the tail on that book? Do you think is it a broader issue that perhaps others are not recognizing yet? Or do you think they are and are acting accordingly. Just a little more there would be helpful?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Great, Mark, it's Jeremy. A couple of things on that. So on that primary casualty contractors liability book, and I think I might have spoken to this last year when we experienced some development in that book in the third or fourth quarter. We would observe that the tail has extended. And some of that would be naturally the result of the court closures and the pandemic effect. We didn't really react to that. But generally speaking, I think tail patterns within primary casualty are growing a little bit longer, and that's part of what we've adjusted within our sort of reserving models moving forward. Some of that is going to be in a re-write a significant amount of construction business. Some of that is also the nature of, as you get into larger projects, the tail is a little bit longer as well. So that is a little bit of what's going on there. I can't speak to what others are or are not recognizing Clearly, there's been a lot of conversations from reinsurers with regards to their elevated levels of concerns around exposures that are growing. And clearly, they've got access to a lot of data from clients to evaluate what that looks like. I can't speak to what's going through others books.\nMark Hughes: Yes, when you think about your top-line, the written premium in the Insurance segment, as you kind of take steps to adjust to this environment, would you expect the growth rate to be more consistent with this quarter or kind of pop back up to the high single, low double-digits?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, great question, Mark. So I think some of that has worked its way through. So growth in insurance from a rent [indiscernible] standpoint, clearly is moderated compared to recent years, and that was further the case in the third quarter. I think there's kind of two meaningful offsetting stories. So we've got pockets of premium contraction which are, I think, being offset by numerous bright spots of growth. So one, we're a substantial writer of professional and financial lines. It represents north of quarter of our overall writings. And as well been covered, that sector has been hit both by less economic activity from lower M&A and public listing activity as well as a decline in pricing. And the latter of which has meant that we're less comfortable with the risk adjusted funds and rate adequacy. And therefore, we've let some of that business lapse. That's leading to lower renewal retention. We're being less aggressive on new business. So we're seeing contraction there. Internationally, the business is performing well. The premiums are flat. We've also contracted in pockets of the general liability portfolio, which I touched on in my comments. As we look to reshape the portfolio, improve diversification. I think the best example of that is demonstrating more discipline within construction in the big four states. And lastly, in our marine and energy portfolio internationally, we let go one very large facility that wasn't performing, and we're seeing less adjustment premiums in our marine war book given the closure of the Grain Corridor in the Black Sea. We've been able to offset those reductions with meaningful growth across a broad range of products. So property in the marine, binding, personal lines, surety, programs, environmental, insurtech in our U.K., Europe, Asia platforms across other marine energy lines. So I feel we're actually really good about our forward prospects. And about the actions that we've been taking. A lot of that is working its way through the portfolio. But all of those actions collectively, I think that should be accretive to earnings into returns. The one other comment I might make on premium volume kind of pertains to the property marketplace. And we've grown here but that's due in large part to taking meaningful rate versus expanding exposure. And property overall is a smaller component of our portfolio than I think it is for many others. I do believe the risk-adjusted returns on property have been very compelling this year, we've been taking advantage both in insurance as well as our Nephila operations. But that said, I appreciate some have certainly leaned into the market harder this year and use that to fuel overall growth in returns, and it's been a good year through 10 months, no doubt. If the property pricing environment remains constructive, and I think it will, we can further take advantage of that across our platform in '24 as well.\nMark Hughes: Appreciate that detail. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Andersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Andersen: Hey, good morning. Maybe continuing on the property opportunity in insurance. If I look back at '22, I think property and Marine was maybe about 15% of NPE. Is there kind of a ceiling for the amount that you'll write for those two lines? And I'm thinking it carries a higher CAT load, but perhaps a better underlying loss ratio just given the strong rate environment?\nJeremy Noble: Yes and important to recognize, it's Jeremy again. Important too to recognize that we add access and to take advantage of the property market environment and the risk-adjusted return propositions in a couple of different ways. So we can write that through conventional traditional insurance. And we can also take advantage of that and are taking advantage of that through our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations, which is more where the reinsurance would come into play as well. This year has been interesting. So it's fortunately, we're kind of 10 months into the year, we're largely through the wind season, the book has performed. The books have performed across the industry quite well. But it's been a challenging last six years previously. Five of the last six have been aggregate insurance losses for natural catastrophes in excess of $100 billion. So while the risk-adjusted return proposition from a modeled situation looked very compelling this year, there was questions in our mind as to how is the year going to play out. We would benefit if it did play out well. We did grow and took advantage of the rate and pricing environment. And then it was a question of what will it look like going into 2024. Will the pricing environment be sustainable? Or would it sort of change after sort of one year. It does look like we should have stable but firm and constructive market pricing environment. So we have the ability to deploy more capital there should we choose to do so. We'll look at that. I'm not going to put a projection around that, but it's certainly something that we would take a close look at back of a good year.\nAndrew Andersen: Yes, and then maybe on the reinsurance side, the book has changed a lot over the years and so is the rate environment. How should we kind of think of like an updated target near to medium term for an ex-CAT, ex-PYD combined ratio? And maybe just with that, can you kind of give us a refresher of the type of GL and professional liability accounts you're writing in this segment?\nJeremy Noble: Sure, so from a sort of a reinsurance platform standpoint, we are, first and foremost, focused on profitability, versus being focused on growth. Now it's happened to be within the professional casualty and specialty lines the last few years, we've been able to take advantage of some pockets of growth opportunistically to offset some of the contraction that the portfolio experienced when we repositioned property through Nephila. From a profitability target standpoint and a combined ratio, we've kind of spoken in the last couple of years, I mean, we want that book to generate meaningful returns on -- meaningful and appropriate returns on capital and pushing it towards the lower 90s or 90 even being a target is something that we are aspiring to sort of achieve. And we're certainly trying to price our deals and portfolio on the most recent underwriting years in that regard. But there's just a lot of noise on the back here. And on long-tail lines within reinsurance, it takes a while to ultimately see where that book gets. We're going to always reserve with an added degree of caution on long-tail professional and liability lines. So that will take a little bit of time. As far as the makeup of the book, it really can kind of change, and it really depends on the underlying clients. We have both quota share and excess of loss structures. These are often broad highly well respected, highly regarded insurance companies where we participate on a subscription basis on the accounts, and it's a wide range of underlying risks. It is more of a U.S. position book, but it does have some international exposure as well.\nAndrew Andersen: Okay, thanks for the detail.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Heleniak: Yes, good morning. Just a question on the intellectual collateral protection line. Just wondering if you feel like you captured most of the impact there from some of the recent events that were in the headlines. And just how comfortable are you with, I guess the exposures there and also some of the changes. I think you touched a little bit on those are some of the changes you made to that book? [Indiscernible] to that book?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, sure. Scott, again Jeremy. So we previously disclosed -- sorry disclosed that our exposure to Vesttoo was in the form of two fraudulent letters of credit, which were provided as reinsurance collateral to our Bermuda-based insurance carrier for intellectual property collateral protection insurance products. One was for $50 million. The other is for just under $78 million. During the third quarter, we had to pay a claim for the $50 million amount. That we otherwise would not have had to pay had the collateral been valid. And that's where we recognized $25 million as far as credit loss. So we're suggesting we believe there's some degree of an ability to mitigate some of that exposure. But that would be a pocket of exposure. We have assessed the likelihood around whether a claim may arise. It's a claims-made product. So on that second exposure, there isn't a claim yet. And just for familiarity on the product, you have to have both a claim. And then it has to be the case that the underlying assets, including the intellectual property, can't -- don't have a value that it could offset against the loan that was in place. And so what we're highlighting there is we have exposure and we're flagging that it's at least reasonably possible that, that could become a claim. And if it were to, we have additional exposure there. Clearly, in that situation, we will take every step that we possibly can to mitigate or remediate against that loss as well. So we're actively pursuing remedies, including within the Vesttoo bankruptcy to reduce any losses that we incurred. On the core product line, this was a relatively new product. It was a new product. It was brought to market I think sort of in 2020. We had -- played an integral role in the inception of a sort of a nascent product. And undoubtedly, we've learned from the early years, if you analogize it to sort of R&D. And we've taken a number of underwriting actions within that book. But we've also contracted our premium writing significantly. And one of the things we've done is we shorten the limits that we issue. And clearly, we're not fronting within that book, anymore either. So we'll watch how the core book performs. But a lot of the exposure that is more meaningful to Markel come to that exposure to Vesttoo, which I covered off.\nScott Heleniak: Okay, and then just another question just on -- you mentioned you're increasing loss picks in certain lines, which I know Markel is a conservative company and has always been a conservative company. But is there any particular areas that you can point to? Or is that just kind of broadly just in casualty, just trying to pick up inflation and severity and those kinds of things? Just anything more to add on that?\nThomas Gayner: Yes. Scott, it is most significantly concentrated within our general liability and professional product lines and more specifically within segments of those classes, but there are large segments and the ones we've underwritten for a long time. We've also grown meaningfully over the years. So again, that primary casualty contractors GL, Excess & Umbrella, D&O, E&O and what I would sort of say there is we feel like there continues to be uncertainty in the current claims environment. And we're dealing with a degree of unknown. And I would just say, generally, that causes our radar to be up. And it doesn't feel like the recent social inflation trends, the cost to adjust and settle claims, the prevalence of litigation funding, the aggressiveness of the plaintiffs' bar, the sentiment of juries and so on is likely to abate in the near-term. So we're planning accordingly. We're building in a margin of safety today to try to get a step ahead of that tomorrow. That's kind of what Markel has always done to your point. We are also responding by, we're pushing rate. We're adjusting terms. We're shortening limits. We're modifying attachment points on a deal-by-deal basis. We're shaping our portfolios, really taking a robust analysis of this underlying claims trends and activities, using segmentation strategies that can impact exposures and locations, subclasses, insureds and so on. And we're trying to build more diversification into our book by challenging areas where we were maybe slightly concentrated in favor of segments where we wanted to grow. So I mentioned earlier the example of sort of thinking of construction or contractors in the four largest states, being sensitive to the weight of the business in those spaces. So each organization, each company is going to sort of take different approaches. Timing is always going to differ largely, I think what I'm speaking to. We view that to be an industry-wide set of circumstances. We've been talking about it for a while. The industry has been grappling with in a while. I would also say that, fortunately, I think it's leading to really good conversations with our trading partners. In the current trading environment, given some of the industry missteps on the year, I mean, more due consideration is given to the quality of the insurance solution, our market-leading claims handling capabilities, I think are really well recognized, and clients are thinking really carefully about who's going to be there for them in five years and 10 years and 20 years. So I think we're kind of trying to go with that from a little bit of a position of strength.\nScott Heleniak: Thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the call back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nThomas Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us. We look forward to catching up with you 90 days from now. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Thomas Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, Regina, good morning, and welcome to the Markel Group third quarter conference call for 2023. My name is Tom Gayner, and I'm joined this morning by Teri Gendron, the Chief Financial Officer; and Jeremy Noble, the President of Insurance to brief you on our results as well as to answer your thoughtful questions. At Markel Group, we remain committed to our long-term goal of building one of the world's great companies. We define that as creating a win, win, win culture, where our customers are better off for having done business with us. Our colleagues are better off by being part of the Markel Group and our shareholders are in excellent returns on their capital as a result of the wins by customers and colleagues. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance of the Markel Group through the first nine months of 2023. But we do have a few blemishes to deal with this year. As always, we will be honest and candid in sharing not only what's working well, but what needs improvement. We believe that this honest and candid self-assessment is the best way to maintain the discipline and clear headedness needed to make good decisions going forward. It is also the way to earn your trust as we demonstrate to you that we acknowledge our challenges and face them head on. Teri will provide you with the detailed numbers in just a minute, and Jeremy will follow with his report on our insurance operations. But before we get to that, I wanted to start off with some high level commentary. As Sheryl Crow saying, every day is a winding road. She's right. We've got some great news, some good news and some challenging news this quarter. While we may be on a winding road, we do continue to move forward. As to the great news, Markel Ventures continues to produce simply outstanding results. For the first nine months of this year, operating income rose 52% from $217 million to $330 million. And EBITDA rose 35% from $353 million to $474 million. There were no material acquisitions at ventures during this time period. These are basically apple sauce to apple sauce numbers. I simply could not be more pleased with the performance of Ventures. The management teams that lead those companies continue to produce outstanding results for the Markel Group. The numbers speak for themselves. As to the good news, and is very good. Our recurring interest and dividend income grew 73% from $302 million to $521 million in the first nine months of 2023. We continue to invest the cash flows and maturing bonds into higher-yielding fixed income securities. Each investment we make in fixed income these days carries a higher interest rate than the bonds that are maturing. And would expect us to continue to earn even higher amounts of recurring investment income in the prevailing interest rate environment. As to our equity investment portfolio, we earned a return of 9.3% through the first nine months of 2023. While this trails the S&P return of 13.1%, we do remain over 100 basis points ahead of the S&P for more than 30 years. I would very happily sign up for the sort of annualized investment results we are putting up so far in 2023. I'd also happily accept 100 basis points of outperformance for the next three decades, if I could do so. As to the challenging news in our insurance operations, we reported a year-to-date combined ratio of 95%. And for the third quarter, we reported a combined ratio of 99%. These results are below our expectations and stem from multiple factors. First, we continue to experience inflation in our claims payments. That inflation reflects higher overall price levels and social inflation that we see in the current legal environment. We continue to incorporate these trends in our reserve setting process. I'm pleased to report to you that despite the challenges, we continue to live up to our goal of setting reserves that prove to be more likely to be redundant and deficient. We did report favorable development in the third quarter. Some of the factors that led to these results include two points of losses in the third quarter from natural catastrophes, including Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. Additionally, we experienced approximately three points of losses in the third quarter from the losses in our collateral protection book, which include exposure to the widely reported vest two bankruptcy and fraud case. Collateral protection is a relatively new product to us and to the marketplace. We learned some tough lessons here, and we've made significant adjustments to the product. While we are extremely disappointed with this loss, we believe we've addressed the causes aggressively. And we are actively working to mitigate potential future losses associated with this product. We are especially disappointed with these particular losses as they obscure the outstanding performance from so many other components of our insurance operations. Rest assured, we continue to work tirelessly to make each engine in the Markel Group performed at the highest levels. And we look forward to future periods of sharing our progress on exactly that with you. We never like calling out specific reasons for our disappointing results. Discussions of natural catastrophes and headline events can deteriorate into an exercise of excuse making. I don't like making excuses any more than you like hearing them. We know that you as shareholders expect us to be able to manage the normal flow of catastrophe losses headline events of wars, consequences of climate change and other things that go bump in the night and still produce acceptable results. That is the very nature of what a successful insurance operation does. We understand the assignment. Rest assured, we continue to work tirelessly, to make each engine in the Markel Group performed at the highest levels, and we look forward to future periods of sharing our progress on exactly that with you. Finally, as one additional marker of our overall financial strength and performance, we invested $270 million in additional public equity investments during the first nine months, which should produce additional returns into the future. The current unrealized gain on our public equity portfolio stands at over $5 billion. I expect that amount to continue to grow over time. We also repurchased $269 million of our own stock so far in 2023 compared with $208 million in the first nine months of last year. My expectation is that we'll continue to produce profitable results in our insurance ventures and investment engines and we will be dividing those profits among future shares -- fewer shares. That seems like a recipe for increasing shareholder value to me. Additionally, I stated last quarter, that in five of the last six quarters, I've personally taken money out of my pocket to buy Markel Group stock on the open market. I continue to do so again during the past quarter. In fact, I invested approximately my entire after-tax salary for Markel Group during the quarter to purchase shares in the open market. At this point, I now have purchased Markel Group shares in six of the last seven quarters. I am confident in our team, I believe in their talent and dedication. I believe they will produce excellent results. We remain committed to building one of the world's great companies, and I thank you for your ongoing support. With that, I'll turn it over to Teri to provide you some of the details of our financial results. Jeremy will pick up with his comments on our insurance engine, and then we'll open the floor for questions. Teri? Thank you, Jeremy. And with that, Regina, if you would please be so kind as to open the floor for questions. Good morning. Yes. Scott, it is most significantly concentrated within our general liability and professional product lines and more specifically within segments of those classes, but there are large segments and the ones we've underwritten for a long time. We've also grown meaningfully over the years. So again, that primary casualty contractors GL, Excess & Umbrella, D&O, E&O and what I would sort of say there is we feel like there continues to be uncertainty in the current claims environment. And we're dealing with a degree of unknown. And I would just say, generally, that causes our radar to be up.

Thank you so much. Bye-bye."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom pointed out, we have a mix of results this quarter, which highlights the importance of our three engine architecture. Using the words of Sheryl Crow, the diversity in our family of business may be helping us to get a little bit closer to feeling fine. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums grew 5% to $7.9 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to $7.5 billion in 2022. Our increased premium volume reflects new business and more favorable rates across many of the product launches within our insurance segment. Partially offset by lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines where we're adjusting our writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of 2023 was 95% compared to 91% for the same period last year. Our 2023 combined ratio included $46 million or one point of net losses attributed to the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. Our 2022 combined ratio included $70 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Ian and $35 million attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which together added two points to the combined ratio. Excluding these losses from both years, our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of '23, was 95% compared to 89% in 2022. The increase was driven by a higher attritional loss ratio in 2023 within our insurance segment, which Jeremy will discuss further. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $170 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $204 million in the first nine months of 2022. We experienced favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in '23. Most notably across our international professional liability product lines and our property product lines within the insurance segment. The favorable development in 2023 was partially offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines within our insurance segment due to an increased frequency of large claims over the past several quarters under excess an umbrella and primary casualty contractors liability products. We also experienced adverse development within our Reinsurance segment in 2023 on our general liability product lines and a discontinued portion of our public entity product line. Turning to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $521 million in the first nine months of 2023 compared to $302 million in the same period last year. With meaningful increases from fixed maturity securities, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. Interest income on our fixed maturity securities reflects a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. On a year-to-date basis, yields on our purchases of fixed maturities have been about 250 basis points higher than securities that rolled off. Higher income from short-term investments is due to higher short-term interest rates in the current year. The largest share of the increase is due to higher interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, as we have increased our allocation to money market funds to take advantage of the current interest rate environment. During the first nine months of 2023, we recognized net unrealized investment losses with an other comprehensive loss of $135 million net of taxes, compared to net unrealized investment losses of $1.3 billion, net effect in 2022. These movements correspond to decreases in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from increases in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature. And we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods if bonds mature. As of September 30th, over 99% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Net investment gains of $591 million for the first nine months of '23, reflect favorable market value movements driving a return of 9.3% on our public equity portfolio during the period. This compares to net investment losses of $2.2 billion for the same period of 2022. As you heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. With regard to our Markel Ventures segment, revenues from Markel Ventures increased 6% to $3.7 billion in the first nine months of 2023, up from $3.5 billion for the first nine months of last year. The increase reflects growth and improved pricing across several of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 35% to $474 million for the first nine months of 2023. From $353 million during the same period last year. The increase was driven by our products businesses, which had higher margins in '23, compared to '22, as we saw material and freight costs stabilize. Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2023 was 21% compared to 23% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $926 million in the same period a year ago. With the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first nine months of 2023 was $1.1 billion compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2022, with swings in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as the largest drivers. Net cash provided by operating activities was $2 billion for the first nine months of 2023 compared to $1.9 billion for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most significant contribution from our insurance engine and a notable year-over-year increase coming from our Markel Ventures engine. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14 billion at the end of September compared to $13.2 million at the end of the year. Overall, we're pleased with our consolidated results so far this year and are confident that we're taking the right steps to address the current challenges on our road to building long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you to discuss our insurance engine results for the third quarter. Clearly, our insurance operations performance is not where we want it to be. However, I am confident that we are taking the right actions quickly in the near term to successfully confront what are predominantly industry-wide challenges that set Markel up for long-term success. As I walk you through our financials, you will see our performance is being impacted by a few pockets within our product portfolio that are negatively influencing our underwriting results for the period. This includes the well-documented higher loss cost trends in recent years, which are creating prior adverse reserve development within our risk managed D&O and excess casualty lines, and mid-market excess an umbrella in primary casualty contractors liability books. We are working incredibly hard to evaluate the ultimate cost to set on claims on these meaningful portfolios, examining the maturing accident years from the last soft market cycle, while seeking to gain confidence around margins on more recent accident years that were written in a more favorable market environment. We are also maintaining a higher level of prudence on our current accident year loss picks within these products due to the uncertainty around future loss cost trends. We are acting with a great deal of discipline being more selective around new business, pushing rates and terms and letting business laps that doesn't meet our profitability targets. We are in the process of remixing our portfolio to improve overall profitability. And ensuring our reserves are robust as we move into 2024. In short, Markel has long been a conservative company and one that demonstrates caution when it comes to evaluating adverse claims trends. Let me now share a few further thoughts on our results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which includes our insurance and reinsurance, State National program services and the fill insurance-linked securities operations. Across all of our businesses within the insurance engine, through three quarters, we have produced $6.3 billion in revenues, up 8% from last year, while generating pretax operating income of $371 million. The insurance engine also continues to generate significant operating cash flows, and we have been intentional about taking the cash and maximizing the investment return on the float generated by our underwriting operations and attractive market yields. Moving to the results of our underwriting operations. We reported a combined ratio of 99% in the third quarter results, which was significantly influenced by several noteworthy items. Three, to be exact. First, we realized a total of $46 million or two points of losses in the quarter related to catastrophe events, specifically the Hawaiian wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. The losses concentrated in our small commercial inland marine and binding property lines. We also recognized $30 million or just under two points of development on the prior accident year losses within a runoff portion of our public entity line in reinsurance. We exited this segment of reinsuring not-for-profit entities in California and other West Coast-based states in 2020, recognizing that this book was not performing adequately. We now believe the ultimate losses from this book are likely need to be greater than what we had previously allowed before. Based on a recent completion of an actuary and claims review. Finally, we recognized losses in the quarter within our intellectual property collateral protection product line, including a $25 million or one point impact to the combined ratio from credit losses related to a fraudulent letter of credit provided by Best 2. Our CPI product in total had a three point impact on our combined ratio. If you exclude these three items, our reported combined ratio of 99% in the quarter converts to 93%, consistent with our result for the first half of this year. This highlights the fact that we have many product lines within our portfolio that are performing very well. Turning to premium production. Overall, gross written premiums in our underwriting operations grew by 1% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date. As I pointed out last quarter, we continued to achieve premium growth in lines where we see opportunities and feel good about the levels of rate adequacy. We are taking advantage of the improved pricing environment and have achieved strong growth in our property, in the marine, binding, personal loans and select marine and energy classes internationally as well as regional growth in our U.K., European and Asian operations. Just as important, we continue to reduce writings in certain classes where we are seeing unacceptable rate decreases relative to loss cost trends. Within our professional liability lines, this is the most notable in the large account public D&O space. We've also decreased writings in our intellectual property collateral protection line as part of our re-underwriting effort in that product. Our professional lines writings have also been impacted by changes in the broader economy, including the slowdown in M&A and public listings, which is impacting premium volume within our transaction liability product line within both our insurance and reinsurance segments. In other professional classes, in particular, within our international portfolio, we are pursuing growth opportunities where we find the business to be adequately priced, although growth has moderated over the course of 2023. Within our general liability product lines, we are seeing solid rate increases overall and achieving moderate opportunistic growth. For example, we are increasing our writings in our finding casualty and environmental lines, which have been consistently profitable. Conversely, we are contracting premiums in our primary casualty contractors liability and excess and umbrella lines where loss costs have been more challenging, and we are carefully selecting risks, pushing rate, managing limits and attachment points to combat these trends. Our year-to-date consolidated combined ratio of 95% for the first nine months of the year is up four points from a year ago. This increase is driven by the items I just discussed earlier, impacting the third quarter results along with the impact from higher attritional loss ratios in our professional liability and general liability product lines and slightly lower overall prior accident year loss takedowns largely driven by our general liability lines. With respect to the increases in our current accident year loss ratio, we remain cautious in recognizing the benefits from our product diversification and re-underwriting strategies within our general liability and professional liability product losses. We are choosing to increase the confidence level in our loss picks to reflect the higher loss cost trends we are seeing in prior accident years and the uncertainty around the economic and claims environment that will exist in the future when we ultimately settle claims on these long tail lines. We also continue to maintain a cautious approach to recognizing prior accident year loss takedowns. We recognized $170 million or three points of prior accident year loss takedowns through the first nine months of the year, down slightly from a year ago. As I've stated in prior quarters, our loss reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to hold loss reserves at levels that are more likely to prove redundant than deficient. And we are reacting quickly by recognizing additional loss reserves and loss trends outpaced previously held expectations. One final comment to make relative to our underwriting results with respect to our Reinsurance segment where we produced a combined ratio of 102% in the quarter. While this result is disappointing, it should be noted that the prior accident year was adverse development in the runoff segment of our public entity book added 11 points to the third quarter Reinsurance segment combined ratio. Excluding this development, our reinsurance result is more aligned with our long-term underwriting targets. We have worked hard in the past two years to re-underwrite our reinsurance treaty mix and return our reinsurance results to profitability. We remain confident that over the long-term, we will see positive and sustainable impact of those efforts materialize in our results. Next, I'll quickly touch on the two portions of our business that are reported as part of our other operations, our program services and other fronting operations and our insurance-linked securities operations. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $3 billion year-to-date versus $2.6 billion a year ago, resulting in an increase in operating revenues of 2% for the first nine months of the year due to expansion of existing programs and addition of new programs. Our State National team continues to perform extremely well producing consistent profitability and continuing to pursue opportunities within our business development pipeline. Within our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations, revenues and expenses for the first nine months of the year were down due to the impact of the sale of our MGA operations in 2022. Revenues within our fund management operations are up from last year due to revenues recognized during the third quarter of this year of $30 million related to the release of capital that had been trapped in side pockets. Our assets under management in Nephila up $6.8 billion is down from a year ago, due to the redemption of side pocket classes in the quarter, which outpaced profits generated from the funds year-to-date. However, the current pricing environment for catastrophe-exposed property risk has created a very attractive return proposition for investors. The platform has produced profitable results for the year. The team is working very hard to capitalize on these market opportunities, focusing on price transparency and portfolio construction. At this time, we feel very well positioned heading into 2024. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities remain robust outside of professional lines, which continue to be impacted by less M&A activity and an unfavorable pricing environment. Overall, trends within the specialty insurance marketplace remains strong. Just a few comments on rate across our portfolio. Throughout 2023, we have achieved modest rate increases across the landscape of our diversified product portfolio. In the current pricing environment, rate trends are more divergent by product class in contrast in the past few years. Pricing seems to be keeping pace with or staying slightly ahead of trend. We are achieving significant rate increases in our property coverages in select marine and energy product lines due to the recent industry loss experience and increasing cost of obtaining reinsurance protection, Additionally, within our general liability product lines, we continue to achieve modest rate increases across most product classes and have seen the level of increases improve over the course of the year. Within our insurance and reinsurance professional liability product lines, we have seen modest rate decreases overall, driven by notable decreases within our public directors and officers product consistent with the broader trends across the industry and to a lesser extent within our errors and emissions coverages. In other professional product liability product lines, particularly within our international portfolio, we are generally seeing consistency in rates. And are continuing to pursue growth opportunities where we find the business to be adequately priced. We're also seeing moderate rate decreases globally within our cyber product line in response to several years of significant rate increases and strong industry underwriting performance. Despite these current trends, we view cyber as a long-term growth opportunity. Finally, we continue to realize low single-digit rate decreases within our workers' compensation product line and are reacting accordingly on a state-by-state basis to maintain profitability. In closing, our focus as a business unit remains on achieving long-term profitable growth across our insurance platform. We have numerous success stories to celebrate across our diversified portfolio of doing just that. Reinsurance market conditions are favorable, and we are taking advantage of this within our operations. Our State National business continues its track record of consistent profitable performance. And Nephila, we are seeing strong returns thus far this year within our portfolios, opening the door to future growth opportunities. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom. Yes. Great, Mark, it's Jeremy. A couple of things on that. So on that primary casualty contractors liability book, and I think I might have spoken to this last year when we experienced some development in that book in the third or fourth quarter. We would observe that the tail has extended. And some of that would be naturally the result of the court closures and the pandemic effect. We didn't really react to that. But generally speaking, I think tail patterns within primary casualty are growing a little bit longer, and that's part of what we've adjusted within our sort of reserving models moving forward. Some of that is going to be in a re-write a significant amount of construction business. Some of that is also the nature of, as you get into larger projects, the tail is a little bit longer as well. So that is a little bit of what's going on there. I can't speak to what others are or are not recognizing Clearly, there's been a lot of conversations from reinsurers with regards to their elevated levels of concerns around exposures that are growing. And clearly, they've got access to a lot of data from clients to evaluate what that looks like. I can't speak to what's going through others books. Yes, great question, Mark. So I think some of that has worked its way through. So growth in insurance from a rent [indiscernible] standpoint, clearly is moderated compared to recent years, and that was further the case in the third quarter. I think there's kind of two meaningful offsetting stories. So we've got pockets of premium contraction which are, I think, being offset by numerous bright spots of growth. So one, we're a substantial writer of professional and financial lines. It represents north of quarter of our overall writings. And as well been covered, that sector has been hit both by less economic activity from lower M&A and public listing activity as well as a decline in pricing. And the latter of which has meant that we're less comfortable with the risk adjusted funds and rate adequacy. And therefore, we've let some of that business lapse. That's leading to lower renewal retention. We're being less aggressive on new business. So we're seeing contraction there. Internationally, the business is performing well. The premiums are flat. We've also contracted in pockets of the general liability portfolio, which I touched on in my comments. As we look to reshape the portfolio, improve diversification. I think the best example of that is demonstrating more discipline within construction in the big four states. And lastly, in our marine and energy portfolio internationally, we let go one very large facility that wasn't performing, and we're seeing less adjustment premiums in our marine war book given the closure of the Grain Corridor in the Black Sea. We've been able to offset those reductions with meaningful growth across a broad range of products. So property in the marine, binding, personal lines, surety, programs, environmental, insurtech in our U.K., Europe, Asia platforms across other marine energy lines. So I feel we're actually really good about our forward prospects. And about the actions that we've been taking. A lot of that is working its way through the portfolio. But all of those actions collectively, I think that should be accretive to earnings into returns. The one other comment I might make on premium volume kind of pertains to the property marketplace. And we've grown here but that's due in large part to taking meaningful rate versus expanding exposure. And property overall is a smaller component of our portfolio than I think it is for many others. I do believe the risk-adjusted returns on property have been very compelling this year, we've been taking advantage both in insurance as well as our Nephila operations. But that said, I appreciate some have certainly leaned into the market harder this year and use that to fuel overall growth in returns, and it's been a good year through 10 months, no doubt. If the property pricing environment remains constructive, and I think it will, we can further take advantage of that across our platform in '24 as well. Yes and important to recognize, it's Jeremy again. Important too to recognize that we add access and to take advantage of the property market environment and the risk-adjusted return propositions in a couple of different ways. So we can write that through conventional traditional insurance. And we can also take advantage of that and are taking advantage of that through our Nephila insurance-linked securities operations, which is more where the reinsurance would come into play as well. This year has been interesting. So it's fortunately, we're kind of 10 months into the year, we're largely through the wind season, the book has performed. The books have performed across the industry quite well. But it's been a challenging last six years previously. Five of the last six have been aggregate insurance losses for natural catastrophes in excess of $100 billion. So while the risk-adjusted return proposition from a modeled situation looked very compelling this year, there was questions in our mind as to how is the year going to play out. We would benefit if it did play out well. We did grow and took advantage of the rate and pricing environment. And then it was a question of what will it look like going into 2024. Will the pricing environment be sustainable? Or would it sort of change after sort of one year. It does look like we should have stable but firm and constructive market pricing environment. So we have the ability to deploy more capital there should we choose to do so. We'll look at that. I'm not going to put a projection around that, but it's certainly something that we would take a close look at back of a good year. Sure, so from a sort of a reinsurance platform standpoint, we are, first and foremost, focused on profitability, versus being focused on growth. Now it's happened to be within the professional casualty and specialty lines the last few years, we've been able to take advantage of some pockets of growth opportunistically to offset some of the contraction that the portfolio experienced when we repositioned property through Nephila. From a profitability target standpoint and a combined ratio, we've kind of spoken in the last couple of years, I mean, we want that book to generate meaningful returns on -- meaningful and appropriate returns on capital and pushing it towards the lower 90s or 90 even being a target is something that we are aspiring to sort of achieve. And we're certainly trying to price our deals and portfolio on the most recent underwriting years in that regard. But there's just a lot of noise on the back here. And on long-tail lines within reinsurance, it takes a while to ultimately see where that book gets. We're going to always reserve with an added degree of caution on long-tail professional and liability lines. So that will take a little bit of time. As far as the makeup of the book, it really can kind of change, and it really depends on the underlying clients. We have both quota share and excess of loss structures. These are often broad highly well respected, highly regarded insurance companies where we participate on a subscription basis on the accounts, and it's a wide range of underlying risks. It is more of a U.S. position book, but it does have some international exposure as well. Yes, sure. Scott, again Jeremy. So we previously disclosed -- sorry disclosed that our exposure to Vesttoo was in the form of two fraudulent letters of credit, which were provided as reinsurance collateral to our Bermuda-based insurance carrier for intellectual property collateral protection insurance products. One was for $50 million. The other is for just under $78 million. During the third quarter, we had to pay a claim for the $50 million amount. That we otherwise would not have had to pay had the collateral been valid. And that's where we recognized $25 million as far as credit loss. So we're suggesting we believe there's some degree of an ability to mitigate some of that exposure. But that would be a pocket of exposure. We have assessed the likelihood around whether a claim may arise. It's a claims-made product. So on that second exposure, there isn't a claim yet. And just for familiarity on the product, you have to have both a claim. And then it has to be the case that the underlying assets, including the intellectual property, can't -- don't have a value that it could offset against the loan that was in place. And so what we're highlighting there is we have exposure and we're flagging that it's at least reasonably possible that, that could become a claim. And if it were to, we have additional exposure there. Clearly, in that situation, we will take every step that we possibly can to mitigate or remediate against that loss as well. So we're actively pursuing remedies, including within the Vesttoo bankruptcy to reduce any losses that we incurred. On the core product line, this was a relatively new product. It was a new product. It was brought to market I think sort of in 2020. We had -- played an integral role in the inception of a sort of a nascent product. And undoubtedly, we've learned from the early years, if you analogize it to sort of R&D. And we've taken a number of underwriting actions within that book. But we've also contracted our premium writing significantly. And one of the things we've done is we shorten the limits that we issue. And clearly, we're not fronting within that book, anymore either. So we'll watch how the core book performs. But a lot of the exposure that is more meaningful to Markel come to that exposure to Vesttoo, which I covered off."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Good morning. Thank you. From Richmond, Virginia, I'd like to welcome you to the Markel Group's second quarter conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, has served as your CEO, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the call this morning. I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Teri Gendron; and our President of Insurance, Jeremy Noble, to share our results with you and to answer your questions. We are very pleased with the results we're reporting to you today. Each of our three engines: Insurance, Markel Ventures and Investments produced positive thrust during the first half of 2023. In our insurance operations, we enjoyed double-digit growth in earned premiums and solid underwriting profitability with a combined ratio of 93% for the first half of 2023. Importantly, we report those results with an ongoing commitment to putting up insurance reserves in a way, which we believe will be more likely to prove redundant than deficient. You can see that commitment through our years of reporting favorable loss development in the vast majority of the times when we report to you each quarter's results. This quarter continues to show that same pattern of favorable development. There's unrelenting commitment at the Markel Group to our culture based on our values. The conservatism we embrace in setting reserves demonstrates our words and action. Both Teri and Jeremy will provide more details on our insurance results and their comments. Markel Ventures produced excellent results during the first half of 2023. Revenues rose to $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion a year ago, and EBITDA reached $317 million versus $250 million in the first half of 2022. It's worth pointing out that this growth in revenues and profitability was largely organic. These are the results of the existing businesses as there were no major acquisitions at Markel Ventures. We did get to apply some capital at a couple of our existing businesses. They added to their businesses with acquisitions of companies in their respective industries, and we love it when that happens. We also continued the ongoing process of purchasing certain non-controlling interests as originally planned in the original acquisitions. Investments also provided excellent returns. Recurring investment income rose 74% to $329 million versus $189 million in the first half of 2022. Our publicly traded equity portfolio produced six-month returns of 11.9%, while this trails the white hot return of 17% posted by the S&P 500. We remain 100 basis points ahead of that index for over 30 years. We don't usually move ahead during sprints, but we do tend to outlast the competition when it comes to marathons. During the first half of 2023, we repurchased $187 million of Markel Group shares. Last year, we repurchased $126 million in the same time period. We also made net purchases of publicly traded equity securities of $155 million compared to $63 million a year ago. The tax-efficient net unrealized gain on our equity portfolio now stands at $5.4 billion compared to $4.2 billion a year ago. While we, as a public company, always provide you with the split times quarterly results, we are running a marathon, not a series of sprints. The split times that we are reporting to you today look good to me as the head coach, but I think these results demonstrate that we remain on track to produce excellent marathon results as we have over long periods before. To put some actual numbers on that and quantify that, I remind you that we consistently use rolling five-year measurement intervals to gauge longer term progress at the Markel Group. The last five years included some of the most difficult insurance and investment markets we've ever faced. The last five years also included the effects of some acquisitions and expansions into new businesses, which did not go as well as we would have hoped it first. Despite that, we've made meaningful progress. Please consider the following: Revenues in the first six months of 2018 were $3.6 billion. Revenues in the first six months of 2023, five years later, came in at $7.8 billion, an increase of 119%. Underwriting profits in the first six months of 2018 were $209 million. Underwriting profits in the first six months of 2023 were $264 million, an increase of 27%. Recurring investment income for the first six months of 2018 was $213 million. Recurring investment income in the first six months of 2023 was $329 million, an increase of 54%. The EBITDA of Markel Ventures in the first six months of 2018 was $82 million. The EBITDA of Markel Ventures in the first six months of 2023 was $317 million, an increase of 284%. The total number of shares of Markel outstanding five years ago was $13.9 million. The total number of shares of Markel today is $13.3 million, a decrease of 4.3%. The price per share five years ago on June 30, 2018, was $1,084. Five years later, the share price stood at $1,385, an increase of 28%. This combination of facts, along with many other factors, seems to have created a situation for many of the indicators of the economic value of Markel Growth, seem to have appreciated at a faster rate than that of the share price. In response to those circumstances, we've repurchased shares in recent years. Additionally, our rate of repurchases was higher in the first half of 2023 than any other period. It's also a matter of public record that in five of the last six quarters I\u2019ve personally taken money out of my pocket to purchase some Markel Group shares. Now I'll turn things over to our CFO, Teri Gendron, to provide you with some details from the quarter and then to Jeremy Noble to discuss our insurance operations. I'll then return with just a few brief comments about our ventures and investment results, and then we'll open the floor for your thoughtful questions. Teri?\nTeri Gendron: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, each of our three engines produced a solid quarter, strong revenue growth within our insurance operations, higher profitability within Markel Ventures and excellent returns from our investment engine showed the benefits of our diversified three-engine architecture. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums grew 7% to $5.4 billion for the first half of 2023, compared to $5 billion in 2022. Our increased premium volume reflects new business and more favorable rates across many of the product lines within our insurance segment. The most notable growth came from our personal lines, marine and energy, property and general liability product lines while we saw lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2023 was 93% compared to 90% for the first half of last year. The increase was driven by a higher attritional loss ratio and expense ratio in 2023 within our insurance segment. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $139 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $123 million in the first half of 2022. We experienced favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in 2023, most notably across our international professional liability product lines. The favorable development in 2023 was partially offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines due to an increased frequency of large claims over the past several quarters on our excess and umbrella product. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains of \u2013 I'm sorry, of $857 million in the first half of 2023 were driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $1.9 billion for the first half of 2022, driven by unfavorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. As Tom noted, we'll continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regard to net investment income, we reported $329 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $189 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher interest income from our money market and short-term investments due to higher short-term interest rates in 2023. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased, reflecting a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. During the first half of 2023, we recognized net unrealized gains on our available-for-sale investments of $30 million within other comprehensive income, primarily related to the positive impact of net foreign exchange movements on our fixed maturity portfolio. This compares to net unrealized losses of $882 million for the same period last year, corresponding to the impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributable to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our fixed maturity portfolio had an average rating of AAA as of June 30 and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 8% to $2.5 billion in the first half of 2023, up from $2.3 billion for the first half of last year. The increase reflects organic growth and improved pricing across several of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 27% to $317 million for the first half of 2023 from $250 million during the same period last year. The increase was driven by our products businesses, which had higher margins in 2023 compared to 2022 as we saw material and freight costs stabilize. Looking at our consolidated results. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 was 21% compared to 22% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.2 billion for the first half of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $986 million in the same period a year ago, with the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first half of 2023 was $1.2 billion compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.7 billion in the first half of 2022, with swings in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations of the largest drivers. Turning to cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion for the first half of 2023 compared to $921 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in the first half of 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most notable year-over-year increase coming from our Markel Ventures operations. Within our underwriting operations, operating cash flows in 2023 were net of a $125 million payment made in the first quarter to complete a retroactive reinsurance transaction to seed our runoff book of UK Motor Casualty business. Total shareholders\u2019 equity stood at $14.2 billion at the end of June compared to $13.2 billion at the end of the year. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our performance during the first two quarters of 2023 and we remain confident in our ability to continue building long-term shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s great to be with you this morning to recap our insurance engine results the first half 2023. The midpoint of the year, we continue to remain focused on achieving profitable growth across all of our insurance businesses. I\u2019m pleased to report that we are well on our way to achieving that goal with revenues across our insurance operations totaling $4.1 billion for the year, up 7% from last year, while generating pre-tax operating income $325 million. Additionally, we continue to invest the float created by our underwriting operations at attractive yield. Let me now share a few thoughts on our first half results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, state national program services, and Nephila insurance-linked securities. Looking first at our Insurance segment. For the first six months of the year, we continue to grow premiums in lines where we see opportunities and feel good about the levels of rate adequacy. Overall gross written premiums in the Insurance segment grew by 9% from a year ago. We are taking advantage of the improved pricing environment in property. We are also growing in many of our other product offerings, including inland marine, binding, personal lines, programs and select marine and energy classes within the London market. As we have discussed in recent quarters, the current market cycle is nuanced with each product line having a bit of its own story. Fortunately, our breadth of product offering when combined with our exceptional underwriting talent allows us to develop robust go-to-market strategies by product. We have continued to decrease our writings in certain of our professional liability lines, most notably in the large account public D&O space, as we continue to remain uncomfortable with the rate decreases and loss cost trends in these products. Professional line space has also been impacted by changes in the broader economy, including the slowdown in M&A and public listings. We remain resolute in our disciplined approach to underwriting and are walking away from business that we believe is not adequately priced and does not meet our profitability targets. We also continue to see benefits from our actions taken over the past few years to reduce our exposure to outsized losses in our underwriting results through actively managing our net exposure to natural catastrophe property losses. As a result, we\u2019ve experienced only modest losses this year from secondary peril events such as winter and convective storm events, while the industry grapples with this more broadly. Within our Insurance segment, we produce a combined ratio of 93 for the first half of the year up 5 points from a year ago. This is primarily due to higher attritional loss ratios in our professional liability and general liability product lines. We recognize that the economic and claims environment that will exist in the future when we ultimately settle claims on these long tail lines is uncertain. Given recent trends, our view is that it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution and build in more of a margin of safety to address the inevitably unpredictable nature of estimating future loss costs. We also continue to maintain a cautious approach to relative to recognizing prior accident year loss takedowns. However, across all of our insurance product lines, we realized $124 million of favorable development on prior year\u2019s loss reserves for the first six months of the year contributing a 4 point benefit to the combined ratio. Prior accident year loss takedowns decreased slightly from a year ago, representing a 1 point increase in the year-to-date combined ratio. This was driven largely by two offsetting factors. First, we realized a more meaningful amount of favorable loss development on our professional liability book within our international operations compared to a year ago, due to benign experience across several product classes. It is worth noting, we continue to remain cautious on prior year loss reserve development trends on our professional liability lines within our U.S. and Bermuda risk managed portfolio. Second, offsetting the increased takedowns within our international professional liability lines with adverse development within our U.S. casualty book, most notably our excess and umbrella product line. This is primarily on the pre-COVID 2017 to 2019 accident years, where the loss experience continues to outpace expectations. Our loss reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to hold loss reserves at levels more likely to prove redundant than deficient and react quickly when loss trends outpace expectations by strengthening loss reserve levels. Further, we are generally not taking credit for favorable trends observed on the 2020 and later accident years where we expect the benefits of improved underwriting conditions could lead to greater long-term profitability. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. Our re-underwriting actions within the portfolio over the past few years continue to deliver profitable improvement. We produced a combined ratio of a 93 for the first half of the year, an improvement in the combined ratio of 4 points, while premium volumes decreased by 4% from a year ago. Decrease in gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment was due to lower premiums in our professional liability lines, partially offset by higher premiums in our marine and energy lines. Premium volume trends are impacted by both premium adjustment activity and timing differences related to renewals. This continues to be most notable in our transactional liability book within our professional liability product line where deal flow continues to remain slow, resulting in ultimate \u2013 lower ultimate premium volumes year-over-year. Lower premium adjustment activity has the effect of increasing our current year attritional loss ratio, which is offset by a decrease in our prior accident year\u2019s loss ratio. Overall, the combined ratio within our reinsurance operations improved year-to-date in 2023 given the losses incurred last year on the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as experiencing greater favorable prior year loss reserve development in the current year. Next, I\u2019ll touch on our program services and other fronting operations and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $1.5 billion this year versus $1.4 billion a year ago. This 5% increase in operating revenues for the first six months of the year was due to expansion of existing programs and addition of new programs. Our state national team continues to perform extremely well. We are pleased with the business development pipeline we see. Further, any dislocation in the fronting space should see state national benefit given its strong and reputable history and leading market position. Within our Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the first six months of the year were down due to the impact of the sale of our Velocity MGA operations in the first quarter of 2022 and the sale of our Volante MGA operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, revenues within our fund management operations are down from last year due to lower assets under management, which stand at $7.2 billion at the end of the period. As a reminder, we realized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter last year related to the sale of our majority stake in Velocity. While our current results in Nephila reflect the lower levels of AUM being experienced, results for the second quarter generated a pre-tax operating profit. The current pricing environment for catastrophe exposed property risk has created an attractive return proposition for investors. Our team is working very hard to capitalize on these market opportunities, focusing on price transparency, portfolio construction. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities generally remain strong outside of professional lines, particularly for our excess and surplus funds operations. Clients are still turning to specialty market solutions given current levels of uncertainty and ongoing economic activity and see the attractiveness or our breadth of product offering. Just a couple comments on rate across our portfolio. As I mentioned before, each product area and region of the world has its own story, but broadly speaking, rates are holding up fairly well and by and large in our estimation are keeping up with and in some cases are slightly ahead of our view of trend. We have many products where rates are up 5% to 10%, for most product lines if rate adequacy is in question, we are seeing success pushing for rate. Equally, we can see evidence of reducing new business, policy retention and quote and bind rates when we aren\u2019t getting the traction we need. We\u2019re also able to push on terms and conditions as well as structure or shape the portfolio if it helps towards desired retention. This is what I\u2019d expect to see under the circumstances and is a demonstration of our commitment to underwriting discipline. Big exceptions are property lines where rates are accelerating more meaningfully from the start of the year and risk managed large account D&O where prices continue to decrease somewhat inexplicably. I\u2019m at a loss for why public D&O pricing continues to deteriorate as well as professional liability pricing trends generally, we remain cautious in these areas, which is contributing to our shrinking exposure. Generally speaking, we\u2019re focused on maintaining rate adequacy across the entirety of our portfolio where we are unable to attain sufficient rate increases or effectively adjust terms and conditions or limits, we are walking away from accounts that do not meet our profitability targets. These actions may have the effect of slowing the top line growth trend from what we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of years. Given the breadth of product offering we have, we are confident we will find pockets that are attractive to grow and we remain very optimistic around longer-term profitable growth objectives. I think we are very well positioned as we approach the latter half of 2023 and look ahead to 2024. Thank you. And with that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. As Teri reported, we enjoyed an excellent first half in our Markel Ventures operations. The CEOs and the people of those organizations continue to do a great job of serving their customers and their associates. Total revenues Adventures rose 8% in the first half from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. EBITDA rose 27% from $230 million to $317 billion. One of the very encouraging points about this comparison is that it\u2019s largely organic. It\u2019s largely apples to apples and not due to additional acquisitions. I hope you take some comfort in seeing these results. I know that I do. I\u2019m delighted that we were able to apply some capital to purchases of non-controlling interests in our array of ventures companies as fully planned for at the time of the original acquisitions, and that a couple of our companies were able to add some additional companies to our family. The acquisition of additional businesses within our platforms of existing businesses is one of our favorite ways to deploy capital, and I\u2019m encouraged to see the maturation and ongoing development of this aspect of Markel Ventures. We remain interested in additional platform acquisitions at Markel Ventures, but remain disciplined in our approach. We remain involved in a few conversations, but I have nothing to report to you on that front, and all I can say is that we continue to work at the task and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined in considering opportunities. In the investment engine, you can see the effect of higher interest rates and solid equity performance shined through. Recurring investment income grew 74% from $189 million to $329 million in the first half, and new money investment rates continued to be higher than the fixed income maturities rolling off as they mature. We continued to purchase only the highest credit quality securities that we can find and remain roughly matched in duration and currency to our insurance liabilities. In our equity portfolio, we earned 11.9% returns in the first half and we purchased $155 million net of new holdings compared to $63 million a year ago. We continue to find securities which meet our hurdle rates for new investments. We also have cash flowing in to fund the growth of our insurance and ventures operations and repurchase Markel Group shares all at the same time. All right, as is always the case, there are challenges at your company. There always will be. That\u2019ll always be the case, and there never is a time when we\u2019re not worried about something or working on some problem. That\u2019s reality. The good news is that you\u2019ve got decades to judge a spy to ascertain whether we\u2019re up to those challenges or not. I think the preponderance of evidence would suggest that we are. The additional good news is that the values and the culture we\u2019ve developed over decades to guide our actions and decisions remains unchanged. We\u2019re committed to continuing on that path to building one of the world\u2019s great companies with our win-win-win architecture, and I look forward to answering your thoughtful questions and working on the future. As Buzz Lightyear would say, to infinity and beyond. With that, we welcome your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Thank you. Good morning.\nTom Gayner: Good morning.\nMark Hughes: I wonder if there\u2019s any more detail you could provide on the reserve development that you\u2019re seeing that you described in the 2017 to 2019 accident years. Is that social inflation, medical inflation? Just a little more on that would be interesting.\nJeremy Noble: Yes, sure. Mark, it\u2019s Jeremy. It\u2019s very similar to what we\u2019ve talked about in recent quarters, and I think what\u2019s being reported broadly across the industry. The reality is, is that the business that we put on the books in years like 2015 to 2019, our view now is it\u2019s not going to be as ultimately profitable as we believe at the time, and that\u2019s because for the time that has passed since then. And so you get into that confluence of events, rising economic inflation, compounding aspects of that, the impacts of COVID, the court closures, the lag in sort of reporting, and then certainly to the point that you raised. Social inflation is a very real thing, so the cost of handling and adjusting and settling claims has gone up, and the role and the prominence of litigation financing has been rising. And so ultimately, we\u2019re witnessing pockets in those longer tail lines, particularly casually like we report this quarter where actual loss frequency and severity are in excess of our expectations. And the reality is, is when we see a little bit of that activity, we allow a bit of time to make sure that we think that there is a trend there. And if we see that trend, then we\u2019re reacting very quickly and we\u2019re acting to try to push hard to get ahead of that and put that behind us. Equally, I would say it\u2019s really important to point out that a lot of times has passed obviously between those sort of this quarter, 2017 to 2019 years for that block of business from 2015 to 2019. And in those years more recently, right, a lot of changes that have taken place. So pushing rate, improving terms and conditions, addressing limits, attachment points, segmentation strategies. We\u2019ve seen deductibles rise. So lots of things have improved the overall health of the portfolios, but we are left to address those older years.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Appreciate the detail. How about the workers\u2019 comp line? How are you approaching that at this point? And then are you seeing any medical inflation pick up there?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Great question. So within workers\u2019 comp it continues to be a great \u2013 and you have to recall, our workers\u2019 comp book is pretty sort of niche within the broader segment. So it\u2019s a lot of very sort of micro workers\u2019 comp and some of the trends that we would see would be a little bit different than maybe broader workers\u2019 comp more broadly. That line of business has been very profitable for us. We\u2019ve consistently seen reductions in prior year loss reserves over time. We still see some of that that the levels aren\u2019t as significant. We don\u2019t yet see the impact \u2013 and prices have been coming off consistently in recent years because of the very positive performance in the product line. We continue to monitor it very closely. We have not seen an impact or rising medical inflation impacting that book for us as of yet, but we\u2019re very focused on reviewing that trend. And the book has not been, it is not been growing at the rate of the broader portfolio as well. So we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re paying very, very close attention to that.\nMark Hughes: Then one other question, the program services fronting big increase this quarter, I think for the six months it\u2019s been not quite as big. Is that just a timing issue on renewals or is there some new business this quarter?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. It\u2019s a handful of things. So within our state national business really pleased with where we stand there, we are expanding a few very strategic relationships. We\u2019ve actually probably done a little bit better in retention of some of the programs than we would\u2019ve anticipated. We\u2019ve onboarded a number of new programs. And equally I think the pipeline at state national looks very good. So some of that played out in the second quarter and we\u2019re up modestly year-to-date. Also within that total fronting space is some of the fronting we do associated with our Nephila operations when we offer a rated balance sheet. So we\u2019ve seen some opportunistic growth in that space because of the attractiveness of the property, catastrophe environment more broadly. So less sort of timing and you never know with our state national platform, we have some very large deals and there\u2019s always an ebb and flow of what\u2019s kind of coming in and what\u2019s leaving the platform. But feel really, really good about where we\u2019re positioned right now.\nMark Hughes: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nTom Gayner: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fox with Fenimore Asset Management. Please go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Thank you. Well, Mark asked two of my questions, so I\u2019ll go with the third. Well, first of all, great results.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, John.\nJohn Fox: So thank you for that. I just want to ask if I\u2019m looking at this the right way. Tom, I heard you talk about the investment income potential to continue to grow. And I'm wondering if you're under selling it. When I look at the Q, it's about $13.7 billion in bonds at fair value, which assuming you get without any credit hits and it's yielding less than 3% at this point. So it seems to me, there's a couple of hundred million of investment income, latent earnings power that's going to earn in over the next few years as those bonds mature. Am I looking at that the right way?\nTom Gayner: Yes. Excuse me of being too wordy in my answers, right. Yes.\nJohn Fox: And that magnitude seems reasonable?\nTom Gayner: Yes.\nJohn Fox: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nTom Gayner: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Good morning. The first question I have was on the insurance unit. The premium growth there, it ticked up a little bit versus Q1. And just curious how you're feeling about just overall pricing in new business environment. Are you constructive in terms of growth for the rest of 2023 and 2024. It sounded like you were kind of based on the commentary about most pricing. I mean there's a few areas. But just anything you can talk about that? And is the growth just being impacted mostly by professional liability and D&O, but the rest of the portfolio you're feeling pretty good about in terms of the rest 2023 and 2024?\nJeremy Noble: I think that's pretty well said, Scott. I don't have a lot to add to that. There's a number of product classes and I mentioned some of this earlier, where we feel it's very attractive. We're seeing great opportunities to grow. I mentioned property and inland marine and personal lines and binding, surety programs, marine and energy in London. So that's one of the benefits we have of having a very broad and diversified product portfolio, we can really sort of choose our points that are most attractive in the insurance market cycle. And we've talked about the fact that it's pretty nuanced right now, so you have to have a strategy around each major product on. You're exactly right. We are a large professional liability lines rider. And so because of one part, a lack of activity in the space that reduces exposure being brought to the market overall and also how the pricing environment is looking not just in public D&O. I mean, that's the best example. But we're being cautious and thoughtful around E&O, EPLI, other lines as well. And because we had a large book that weighs some of the growth opportunity. Casualty is an area where the growth is more tempered compared to last couple of years, but it's a good example of where we are able to push rate and we're certainly able to sort of have sort of segmentation strategies about how and where we choose to play in the casualty line. So overall, if you okay in that space as well. So I think the growth opportunities remain out there, and we're pretty confident about our platform given the breadth of product offering.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Great. That's helpful detail. I just wanted to follow up one quick question, too, on the reserve add and general liability, the umbrella excess casualty for 2017 and 2019. Is this a \u2013 it's based on some of the \u2013 an uptick in cases and claims. Obviously, you're seeing something, but \u2013 is it just kind of early signs and you're putting up IBNR just to be conservative on that? Or just anything you can touch on the actual activity that you're seeing there, either frequency or severity in those lines? Is there anything more you can comment on that?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. I mean, there's something to completely pinpoint, Scott. Beyond just suggesting within our actuarial models, especially when you're starting to talk about those older years. So these are on sort of really the 2017 and 2019 years \u2013 so several years these would be maturing well under their cycles. We have had a lot of history with these programs. And we would be seeing this point more reported loss activity than we would have been anticipating. I don't \u2013 I'm not drawn to a specific element with regards to frequency versus severity. It's just in total, the claims reporting pattern, the volume of activity is more significant than what we would expect. And then you extrapolate that. So a little bit of out \u2013 a little bit more reported activity than we would have expected in our underlying models, if we concerned that could become a trend. We extrapolate that, and we take a more significant movement, right. So the total dollars in the period of actual versus expected on that loss activity, it pales in comparison to the total amount of loss development we recognized in the period. So now we'll wait and see how that sort of trends and develops over time. But a lot of that is now sitting in IBNR, we continue to be very, very cautious to respond quickly on that back year development.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Got it. And just a last question just on Markel Ventures, Tom, could you comment on just \u2013 you mentioned some conversations and discussions you're having and how those have kind of trended just the number of them this year versus last year and anything you can add there? And is deal pricing still \u2013 I know I was kind of holding you back a little bit. Is that still case now? Or just any update on kind of what you're seeing in terms of potential M&A for ventures.\nTom Gayner: Sure. Well, let me give you some precise answers on that. So the conversations we're having now, reported some, the conversations a year ago, almost none. So just a few more people have talked to. And the gap would be in pricing and remaining disciplined and being a different kind of buyer than the other buyers that are out there. That's something obviously sellers are aware of. We can bridge those gaps and get close in some markets. Other markets, we just have to wait and let the tide roll out a little bit and we've been doing that for a while. And it's not unprecedented. The first Markel Ventures deal we did was in 2005. We didn't do the second 1 until I think, three years later in 2008. So we're used to periods where we just talk to people and wait for the stars to align.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Well, some is better than none, right?\nTom Gayner: That's correct.\nScott Heleniak: All right, thanks a lot.\nTom Gayner: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much for your ongoing support and interest. We look forward to catching up with you in another 90 days. We will.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you. From Richmond, Virginia, I'd like to welcome you to the Markel Group's second quarter conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, has served as your CEO, and it is my pleasure to welcome you to the call this morning. I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Teri Gendron; and our President of Insurance, Jeremy Noble, to share our results with you and to answer your questions. We are very pleased with the results we're reporting to you today. Each of our three engines: Insurance, Markel Ventures and Investments produced positive thrust during the first half of 2023. In our insurance operations, we enjoyed double-digit growth in earned premiums and solid underwriting profitability with a combined ratio of 93% for the first half of 2023. Importantly, we report those results with an ongoing commitment to putting up insurance reserves in a way, which we believe will be more likely to prove redundant than deficient. You can see that commitment through our years of reporting favorable loss development in the vast majority of the times when we report to you each quarter's results. This quarter continues to show that same pattern of favorable development. There's unrelenting commitment at the Markel Group to our culture based on our values. The conservatism we embrace in setting reserves demonstrates our words and action. Both Teri and Jeremy will provide more details on our insurance results and their comments. Markel Ventures produced excellent results during the first half of 2023. Revenues rose to $2.5 billion compared to $2.3 billion a year ago, and EBITDA reached $317 million versus $250 million in the first half of 2022. It's worth pointing out that this growth in revenues and profitability was largely organic. These are the results of the existing businesses as there were no major acquisitions at Markel Ventures. We did get to apply some capital at a couple of our existing businesses. They added to their businesses with acquisitions of companies in their respective industries, and we love it when that happens. We also continued the ongoing process of purchasing certain non-controlling interests as originally planned in the original acquisitions. Investments also provided excellent returns. Recurring investment income rose 74% to $329 million versus $189 million in the first half of 2022. Our publicly traded equity portfolio produced six-month returns of 11.9%, while this trails the white hot return of 17% posted by the S&P 500. We remain 100 basis points ahead of that index for over 30 years. We don't usually move ahead during sprints, but we do tend to outlast the competition when it comes to marathons. During the first half of 2023, we repurchased $187 million of Markel Group shares. Last year, we repurchased $126 million in the same time period. We also made net purchases of publicly traded equity securities of $155 million compared to $63 million a year ago. The tax-efficient net unrealized gain on our equity portfolio now stands at $5.4 billion compared to $4.2 billion a year ago. While we, as a public company, always provide you with the split times quarterly results, we are running a marathon, not a series of sprints. The split times that we are reporting to you today look good to me as the head coach, but I think these results demonstrate that we remain on track to produce excellent marathon results as we have over long periods before. To put some actual numbers on that and quantify that, I remind you that we consistently use rolling five-year measurement intervals to gauge longer term progress at the Markel Group. The last five years included some of the most difficult insurance and investment markets we've ever faced. The last five years also included the effects of some acquisitions and expansions into new businesses, which did not go as well as we would have hoped it first. Despite that, we've made meaningful progress. Please consider the following: Revenues in the first six months of 2018 were $3.6 billion. Revenues in the first six months of 2023, five years later, came in at $7.8 billion, an increase of 119%. Underwriting profits in the first six months of 2018 were $209 million. Underwriting profits in the first six months of 2023 were $264 million, an increase of 27%. Recurring investment income for the first six months of 2018 was $213 million. Recurring investment income in the first six months of 2023 was $329 million, an increase of 54%. The EBITDA of Markel Ventures in the first six months of 2018 was $82 million. The EBITDA of Markel Ventures in the first six months of 2023 was $317 million, an increase of 284%. The total number of shares of Markel outstanding five years ago was $13.9 million. The total number of shares of Markel today is $13.3 million, a decrease of 4.3%. The price per share five years ago on June 30, 2018, was $1,084. Five years later, the share price stood at $1,385, an increase of 28%. This combination of facts, along with many other factors, seems to have created a situation for many of the indicators of the economic value of Markel Growth, seem to have appreciated at a faster rate than that of the share price. In response to those circumstances, we've repurchased shares in recent years. Additionally, our rate of repurchases was higher in the first half of 2023 than any other period. It's also a matter of public record that in five of the last six quarters I've personally taken money out of my pocket to purchase some Markel Group shares. Now I'll turn things over to our CFO, Teri Gendron, to provide you with some details from the quarter and then to Jeremy Noble to discuss our insurance operations. I'll then return with just a few brief comments about our ventures and investment results, and then we'll open the floor for your thoughtful questions. Teri? Thank you, Jeremy. As Teri reported, we enjoyed an excellent first half in our Markel Ventures operations. The CEOs and the people of those organizations continue to do a great job of serving their customers and their associates. Total revenues Adventures rose 8% in the first half from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. EBITDA rose 27% from $230 million to $317 billion. One of the very encouraging points about this comparison is that it's largely organic. It's largely apples to apples and not due to additional acquisitions. I hope you take some comfort in seeing these results. I know that I do. I'm delighted that we were able to apply some capital to purchases of non-controlling interests in our array of ventures companies as fully planned for at the time of the original acquisitions, and that a couple of our companies were able to add some additional companies to our family. The acquisition of additional businesses within our platforms of existing businesses is one of our favorite ways to deploy capital, and I'm encouraged to see the maturation and ongoing development of this aspect of Markel Ventures. We remain interested in additional platform acquisitions at Markel Ventures, but remain disciplined in our approach. We remain involved in a few conversations, but I have nothing to report to you on that front, and all I can say is that we continue to work at the task and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined in considering opportunities. In the investment engine, you can see the effect of higher interest rates and solid equity performance shined through. Recurring investment income grew 74% from $189 million to $329 million in the first half, and new money investment rates continued to be higher than the fixed income maturities rolling off as they mature. We continued to purchase only the highest credit quality securities that we can find and remain roughly matched in duration and currency to our insurance liabilities. In our equity portfolio, we earned 11.9% returns in the first half and we purchased $155 million net of new holdings compared to $63 million a year ago. We continue to find securities which meet our hurdle rates for new investments. We also have cash flowing in to fund the growth of our insurance and ventures operations and repurchase Markel Group shares all at the same time. All right, as is always the case, there are challenges at your company. There always will be. That'll always be the case, and there never is a time when we're not worried about something or working on some problem. That's reality. The good news is that you've got decades to judge a spy to ascertain whether we're up to those challenges or not. I think the preponderance of evidence would suggest that we are. The additional good news is that the values and the culture we've developed over decades to guide our actions and decisions remains unchanged. We're committed to continuing on that path to building one of the world's great companies with our win-win-win architecture, and I look forward to answering your thoughtful questions and working on the future. As Buzz Lightyear would say, to infinity and beyond. With that, we welcome your questions. Good morning. Sure. Thank you, John. Yes. Excuse me of being too wordy in my answers, right. Yes. Yes. You're welcome. Sure. Well, let me give you some precise answers on that. So the conversations we're having now, reported some, the conversations a year ago, almost none. So just a few more people have talked to. And the gap would be in pricing and remaining disciplined and being a different kind of buyer than the other buyers that are out there. That's something obviously sellers are aware of. We can bridge those gaps and get close in some markets. Other markets, we just have to wait and let the tide roll out a little bit and we've been doing that for a while. And it's not unprecedented. The first Markel Ventures deal we did was in 2005. We didn't do the second 1 until I think, three years later in 2008. So we're used to periods where we just talk to people and wait for the stars to align. That's correct. Thank you. Thank you very much for your ongoing support and interest. We look forward to catching up with you in another 90 days. We will."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom mentioned, each of our three engines produced a solid quarter, strong revenue growth within our insurance operations, higher profitability within Markel Ventures and excellent returns from our investment engine showed the benefits of our diversified three-engine architecture. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums grew 7% to $5.4 billion for the first half of 2023, compared to $5 billion in 2022. Our increased premium volume reflects new business and more favorable rates across many of the product lines within our insurance segment. The most notable growth came from our personal lines, marine and energy, property and general liability product lines while we saw lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2023 was 93% compared to 90% for the first half of last year. The increase was driven by a higher attritional loss ratio and expense ratio in 2023 within our insurance segment. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $139 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $123 million in the first half of 2022. We experienced favorable loss reserve development across multiple product lines in 2023, most notably across our international professional liability product lines. The favorable development in 2023 was partially offset by adverse development on our general liability product lines due to an increased frequency of large claims over the past several quarters on our excess and umbrella product. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains of \u2013 I'm sorry, of $857 million in the first half of 2023 were driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $1.9 billion for the first half of 2022, driven by unfavorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. As Tom noted, we'll continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. With regard to net investment income, we reported $329 million in the first half of 2023 compared to $189 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher interest income from our money market and short-term investments due to higher short-term interest rates in 2023. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased, reflecting a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. During the first half of 2023, we recognized net unrealized gains on our available-for-sale investments of $30 million within other comprehensive income, primarily related to the positive impact of net foreign exchange movements on our fixed maturity portfolio. This compares to net unrealized losses of $882 million for the same period last year, corresponding to the impact of increases in interest rates on our fixed maturity portfolio. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributable to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our fixed maturity portfolio had an average rating of AAA as of June 30 and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 8% to $2.5 billion in the first half of 2023, up from $2.3 billion for the first half of last year. The increase reflects organic growth and improved pricing across several of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 27% to $317 million for the first half of 2023 from $250 million during the same period last year. The increase was driven by our products businesses, which had higher margins in 2023 compared to 2022 as we saw material and freight costs stabilize. Looking at our consolidated results. Our effective tax rate for the first half of 2023 was 21% compared to 22% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $1.2 billion for the first half of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $986 million in the same period a year ago, with the change largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first half of 2023 was $1.2 billion compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $1.7 billion in the first half of 2022, with swings in both fixed maturity and public equity valuations of the largest drivers. Turning to cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1 billion for the first half of 2023 compared to $921 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flows in the first half of 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most notable year-over-year increase coming from our Markel Ventures operations. Within our underwriting operations, operating cash flows in 2023 were net of a $125 million payment made in the first quarter to complete a retroactive reinsurance transaction to seed our runoff book of UK Motor Casualty business. Total shareholders' equity stood at $14.2 billion at the end of June compared to $13.2 billion at the end of the year. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance during the first two quarters of 2023 and we remain confident in our ability to continue building long-term shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Teri, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be with you this morning to recap our insurance engine results the first half 2023. The midpoint of the year, we continue to remain focused on achieving profitable growth across all of our insurance businesses. I'm pleased to report that we are well on our way to achieving that goal with revenues across our insurance operations totaling $4.1 billion for the year, up 7% from last year, while generating pre-tax operating income $325 million. Additionally, we continue to invest the float created by our underwriting operations at attractive yield. Let me now share a few thoughts on our first half results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, state national program services, and Nephila insurance-linked securities. Looking first at our Insurance segment. For the first six months of the year, we continue to grow premiums in lines where we see opportunities and feel good about the levels of rate adequacy. Overall gross written premiums in the Insurance segment grew by 9% from a year ago. We are taking advantage of the improved pricing environment in property. We are also growing in many of our other product offerings, including inland marine, binding, personal lines, programs and select marine and energy classes within the London market. As we have discussed in recent quarters, the current market cycle is nuanced with each product line having a bit of its own story. Fortunately, our breadth of product offering when combined with our exceptional underwriting talent allows us to develop robust go-to-market strategies by product. We have continued to decrease our writings in certain of our professional liability lines, most notably in the large account public D&O space, as we continue to remain uncomfortable with the rate decreases and loss cost trends in these products. Professional line space has also been impacted by changes in the broader economy, including the slowdown in M&A and public listings. We remain resolute in our disciplined approach to underwriting and are walking away from business that we believe is not adequately priced and does not meet our profitability targets. We also continue to see benefits from our actions taken over the past few years to reduce our exposure to outsized losses in our underwriting results through actively managing our net exposure to natural catastrophe property losses. As a result, we've experienced only modest losses this year from secondary peril events such as winter and convective storm events, while the industry grapples with this more broadly. Within our Insurance segment, we produce a combined ratio of 93 for the first half of the year up 5 points from a year ago. This is primarily due to higher attritional loss ratios in our professional liability and general liability product lines. We recognize that the economic and claims environment that will exist in the future when we ultimately settle claims on these long tail lines is uncertain. Given recent trends, our view is that it's best to err on the side of caution and build in more of a margin of safety to address the inevitably unpredictable nature of estimating future loss costs. We also continue to maintain a cautious approach to relative to recognizing prior accident year loss takedowns. However, across all of our insurance product lines, we realized $124 million of favorable development on prior year's loss reserves for the first six months of the year contributing a 4 point benefit to the combined ratio. Prior accident year loss takedowns decreased slightly from a year ago, representing a 1 point increase in the year-to-date combined ratio. This was driven largely by two offsetting factors. First, we realized a more meaningful amount of favorable loss development on our professional liability book within our international operations compared to a year ago, due to benign experience across several product classes. It is worth noting, we continue to remain cautious on prior year loss reserve development trends on our professional liability lines within our U.S. and Bermuda risk managed portfolio. Second, offsetting the increased takedowns within our international professional liability lines with adverse development within our U.S. casualty book, most notably our excess and umbrella product line. This is primarily on the pre-COVID 2017 to 2019 accident years, where the loss experience continues to outpace expectations. Our loss reserving philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to hold loss reserves at levels more likely to prove redundant than deficient and react quickly when loss trends outpace expectations by strengthening loss reserve levels. Further, we are generally not taking credit for favorable trends observed on the 2020 and later accident years where we expect the benefits of improved underwriting conditions could lead to greater long-term profitability. Turning next to the Reinsurance segment. Our re-underwriting actions within the portfolio over the past few years continue to deliver profitable improvement. We produced a combined ratio of a 93 for the first half of the year, an improvement in the combined ratio of 4 points, while premium volumes decreased by 4% from a year ago. Decrease in gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment was due to lower premiums in our professional liability lines, partially offset by higher premiums in our marine and energy lines. Premium volume trends are impacted by both premium adjustment activity and timing differences related to renewals. This continues to be most notable in our transactional liability book within our professional liability product line where deal flow continues to remain slow, resulting in ultimate \u2013 lower ultimate premium volumes year-over-year. Lower premium adjustment activity has the effect of increasing our current year attritional loss ratio, which is offset by a decrease in our prior accident year's loss ratio. Overall, the combined ratio within our reinsurance operations improved year-to-date in 2023 given the losses incurred last year on the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as experiencing greater favorable prior year loss reserve development in the current year. Next, I'll touch on our program services and other fronting operations and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $1.5 billion this year versus $1.4 billion a year ago. This 5% increase in operating revenues for the first six months of the year was due to expansion of existing programs and addition of new programs. Our state national team continues to perform extremely well. We are pleased with the business development pipeline we see. Further, any dislocation in the fronting space should see state national benefit given its strong and reputable history and leading market position. Within our Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the first six months of the year were down due to the impact of the sale of our Velocity MGA operations in the first quarter of 2022 and the sale of our Volante MGA operations in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, revenues within our fund management operations are down from last year due to lower assets under management, which stand at $7.2 billion at the end of the period. As a reminder, we realized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter last year related to the sale of our majority stake in Velocity. While our current results in Nephila reflect the lower levels of AUM being experienced, results for the second quarter generated a pre-tax operating profit. The current pricing environment for catastrophe exposed property risk has created an attractive return proposition for investors. Our team is working very hard to capitalize on these market opportunities, focusing on price transparency, portfolio construction. Turning to current market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities generally remain strong outside of professional lines, particularly for our excess and surplus funds operations. Clients are still turning to specialty market solutions given current levels of uncertainty and ongoing economic activity and see the attractiveness or our breadth of product offering. Just a couple comments on rate across our portfolio. As I mentioned before, each product area and region of the world has its own story, but broadly speaking, rates are holding up fairly well and by and large in our estimation are keeping up with and in some cases are slightly ahead of our view of trend. We have many products where rates are up 5% to 10%, for most product lines if rate adequacy is in question, we are seeing success pushing for rate. Equally, we can see evidence of reducing new business, policy retention and quote and bind rates when we aren't getting the traction we need. We're also able to push on terms and conditions as well as structure or shape the portfolio if it helps towards desired retention. This is what I'd expect to see under the circumstances and is a demonstration of our commitment to underwriting discipline. Big exceptions are property lines where rates are accelerating more meaningfully from the start of the year and risk managed large account D&O where prices continue to decrease somewhat inexplicably. I'm at a loss for why public D&O pricing continues to deteriorate as well as professional liability pricing trends generally, we remain cautious in these areas, which is contributing to our shrinking exposure. Generally speaking, we're focused on maintaining rate adequacy across the entirety of our portfolio where we are unable to attain sufficient rate increases or effectively adjust terms and conditions or limits, we are walking away from accounts that do not meet our profitability targets. These actions may have the effect of slowing the top line growth trend from what we've seen in the past couple of years. Given the breadth of product offering we have, we are confident we will find pockets that are attractive to grow and we remain very optimistic around longer-term profitable growth objectives. I think we are very well positioned as we approach the latter half of 2023 and look ahead to 2024. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn things back over to Tom. Yes, sure. Mark, it's Jeremy. It's very similar to what we've talked about in recent quarters, and I think what's being reported broadly across the industry. The reality is, is that the business that we put on the books in years like 2015 to 2019, our view now is it's not going to be as ultimately profitable as we believe at the time, and that's because for the time that has passed since then. And so you get into that confluence of events, rising economic inflation, compounding aspects of that, the impacts of COVID, the court closures, the lag in sort of reporting, and then certainly to the point that you raised. Social inflation is a very real thing, so the cost of handling and adjusting and settling claims has gone up, and the role and the prominence of litigation financing has been rising. And so ultimately, we're witnessing pockets in those longer tail lines, particularly casually like we report this quarter where actual loss frequency and severity are in excess of our expectations. And the reality is, is when we see a little bit of that activity, we allow a bit of time to make sure that we think that there is a trend there. And if we see that trend, then we're reacting very quickly and we're acting to try to push hard to get ahead of that and put that behind us. Equally, I would say it's really important to point out that a lot of times has passed obviously between those sort of this quarter, 2017 to 2019 years for that block of business from 2015 to 2019. And in those years more recently, right, a lot of changes that have taken place. So pushing rate, improving terms and conditions, addressing limits, attachment points, segmentation strategies. We've seen deductibles rise. So lots of things have improved the overall health of the portfolios, but we are left to address those older years. Yes. Great question. So within workers' comp it continues to be a great \u2013 and you have to recall, our workers' comp book is pretty sort of niche within the broader segment. So it's a lot of very sort of micro workers' comp and some of the trends that we would see would be a little bit different than maybe broader workers' comp more broadly. That line of business has been very profitable for us. We've consistently seen reductions in prior year loss reserves over time. We still see some of that that the levels aren't as significant. We don't yet see the impact \u2013 and prices have been coming off consistently in recent years because of the very positive performance in the product line. We continue to monitor it very closely. We have not seen an impact or rising medical inflation impacting that book for us as of yet, but we're very focused on reviewing that trend. And the book has not been, it is not been growing at the rate of the broader portfolio as well. So we'll see. We're paying very, very close attention to that. Yes. It's a handful of things. So within our state national business really pleased with where we stand there, we are expanding a few very strategic relationships. We've actually probably done a little bit better in retention of some of the programs than we would've anticipated. We've onboarded a number of new programs. And equally I think the pipeline at state national looks very good. So some of that played out in the second quarter and we're up modestly year-to-date. Also within that total fronting space is some of the fronting we do associated with our Nephila operations when we offer a rated balance sheet. So we've seen some opportunistic growth in that space because of the attractiveness of the property, catastrophe environment more broadly. So less sort of timing and you never know with our state national platform, we have some very large deals and there's always an ebb and flow of what's kind of coming in and what's leaving the platform. But feel really, really good about where we're positioned right now. I think that's pretty well said, Scott. I don't have a lot to add to that. There's a number of product classes and I mentioned some of this earlier, where we feel it's very attractive. We're seeing great opportunities to grow. I mentioned property and inland marine and personal lines and binding, surety programs, marine and energy in London. So that's one of the benefits we have of having a very broad and diversified product portfolio, we can really sort of choose our points that are most attractive in the insurance market cycle. And we've talked about the fact that it's pretty nuanced right now, so you have to have a strategy around each major product on. You're exactly right. We are a large professional liability lines rider. And so because of one part, a lack of activity in the space that reduces exposure being brought to the market overall and also how the pricing environment is looking not just in public D&O. I mean, that's the best example. But we're being cautious and thoughtful around E&O, EPLI, other lines as well. And because we had a large book that weighs some of the growth opportunity. Casualty is an area where the growth is more tempered compared to last couple of years, but it's a good example of where we are able to push rate and we're certainly able to sort of have sort of segmentation strategies about how and where we choose to play in the casualty line. So overall, if you okay in that space as well. So I think the growth opportunities remain out there, and we're pretty confident about our platform given the breadth of product offering. Yes. I mean, there's something to completely pinpoint, Scott. Beyond just suggesting within our actuarial models, especially when you're starting to talk about those older years. So these are on sort of really the 2017 and 2019 years \u2013 so several years these would be maturing well under their cycles. We have had a lot of history with these programs. And we would be seeing this point more reported loss activity than we would have been anticipating. I don't \u2013 I'm not drawn to a specific element with regards to frequency versus severity. It's just in total, the claims reporting pattern, the volume of activity is more significant than what we would expect. And then you extrapolate that. So a little bit of out \u2013 a little bit more reported activity than we would have expected in our underlying models, if we concerned that could become a trend. We extrapolate that, and we take a more significant movement, right. So the total dollars in the period of actual versus expected on that loss activity, it pales in comparison to the total amount of loss development we recognized in the period. So now we'll wait and see how that sort of trends and develops over time. But a lot of that is now sitting in IBNR, we continue to be very, very cautious to respond quickly on that back year development."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Good morning. Thank you, Chauntelle. And welcome to the first quarter Markel conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, your CEO and I'm joined today by my new colleague, Teri Gendron, who started as our CFO in mid March. I'll remind you that means she was here for all of two weeks of our first quarter. Given that tenure, we will probably ask her all of the really hard questions. Additionally, Jeremy Noble, President of our insurance operations is also on the call with us today. As always, we remind you that at Markel we focus on the long term. We have been in business since 1930, through three generations of the Markel family and have been public since 1986. Every action we take remains focused on the long term success of Markel. All of us are committed to building one of the world's great companies. We define a great company as one driven by win, win, win architecture. We do our best to make sure that our customers win by doing business with us, that our associates win by being part of this organization, and that our shareholders win through high and durable returns on their capital. We are more oriented towards time frames of 90 years than the 90 days that make up quarter, but we do enjoy the process of sharing our quarterly reports card with you. You are the owners of this business and we appreciate the chance to discuss how things are going, what we are working on and any highlights or low-lights happening at your company. We look forward to your thoughtful questions on our circumstances. As to 2023, we have got good news to share with you. We are off to a good start. As David Letterman might say, compared to the negative headlines that tend to dominate the news, here's today's list of the top 10 things to be happy about as a shareholder of Markel. Number 10, all three engines of Markel produced positive results in the first quarter. The beauty of the design of our three engine system is that as long as any single one of them is doing well that can create enough thrust to drive the whole shift forward. Not all three will always be positive in every quarter and every year. But in the vast majority of quarters and years, we make forward progress. The first quarter of 2023 was one where there was positive thrust in insurance, ventures and investments. Number 9, earned premiums in our insurance operations grew to $1.97 billion, up from $1.76 billion a year ago. We continue to produce profitable growth through careful and disciplined underwriting. Number 8, the insurance operations produced meaningful underwriting profits. While our combined ratio of 94 has been above our targets, we are proud of that result. It reflects both underwriting discipline and a commitment to integrity and conservatism in the way we report these results to you. As we state consistently, we wish our loss reserves to be more likely to be redundant than efficient. We continue to meet that crucial goal as witnessed by yet another quarterly report with favorable development of prior year reserves. We do not accomplish that 100% of the time but we get pretty darn close to meeting that standard. While we remain in an environment of inflationary pressures, both social and monetary, I think that continuing to report reserve redundancies is a big accomplishment. We remain committed to that goal as we have been for decades. Number seven, recurring investment income grew to $159 million, up from $92 million as we continue to invest at higher and higher interest rates. Number six, our ventures operations set records in revenues and EBITDA. That growth was almost entirely organic as we didn't do any acquisitions during 2022. It's an apples-to-apples comparison. Number five, we continue to purchase attractively priced publicly traded equity securities that met our four part test of buying profitable businesses with good returns on capital and not too much leverage, run by managers with equal measures of talent and integrity, with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline at fair prices. During the first quarter, we bought a net of $65 million of public securities. Number four, we continue to repurchase our own shares. During the first quarter, we bought $81 million of Markel shares. Our recurring investment income largely provided the cash we used to buy additional common stocks and our own shares. Number three, our unrealized gain on our portfolio of publicly traded equities reached $4.9 billion. Number two, while there is no mark-to-market of the value of our Markel Ventures operations captured by GAAP accounting, I would assert that record revenues and EBITDA would strongly suggest that those businesses continue to increase in value. Number one, inbound phone calls for potential acquisitions started to reappear during the first quarter. This seems like a logical consequence of the disruption caused by rising interest rates and volatility in financial markets, and that ought to lead to opportunities for us over time. The net of all these things is that Markel continues to produce wins for our customers, our associates and our shareholders across the board. With that, I'll turn it over to Teri to provide you with numbers that flesh out some specifics behind the top 10 list. Jeremy will then pick up some commentary on our insurance operations, and then I'll follow up with a few thoughts about ventures and investing. And after that, we'll take your questions. Teri?\nTeri Gendron: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I couldn't be happier to be part of the Markel team. It's been just a short while but I can already see the role the Markel culture plays in our long term success. Onto our first quarter results. As Tom remarked, 2023 is off to a good start, reflecting growth in meaningful contributions from each of our three engines. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums were $2.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 6%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume and more favorable rates across many of the product lines within our insurance segment with the most notable growth coming from our personal lines, property and marine and energy product lines, while we saw lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines, where we are adjusting our writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes. Retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2023, which is down 3 points from the same period last year. The lower retention in 2023 compared to 2022 reflects higher session rates on our professional liability and personal lines product lines within the insurance segment and our marine and energy product lines within the Reinsurance segment, as well as changes in mix of business within the Reinsurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2023 was 94%. This compared to an 89% for the first quarter last year, which included $35 million or 2 points of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The increase in the consolidated combined ratio reflects a higher attritional loss ratio and the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year's loss reserves in 2023 compared to 2022 within our insurance segment. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $71 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $96 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to favorable development on our general liability and professional liability product lines in our insurance segment in '22, which we did not experienced in 2023. We remain cautious and conservative in our approach to reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer tail general liability and professional liability lines, given the current uncertain economic environment. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains were $373 million in the first quarter of 2023 and reflect an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $358 million for the comparable quarter in 2022, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by unfavorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of March, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $4.9 billion. With regard to net investment income, we reported $159 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $92 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher interest income from our money market and short term investments due to higher short term interest rates in 2023. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased, reflecting a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. The change in net unrealized investment losses included in other comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2023 net of taxes was an increase of $164 million compared to a decrease of $521 million in 2022. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our fixed maturity portfolio had an average rating of AAA as of March 31st, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 16% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up from $950 million for the comparable quarter last year. The increase reflects strong organic growth and improved pricing across many of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 25% to $120 million for the first quarter of 2023 from $96 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our transportation related and equipment manufacturing businesses. Before turning to the consolidated results for the quarter, there's one new item I'd like to draw your attention to related to the new accounting standard on long duration insurance contracts that we adopted January 1st, which impacts our portfolio of life and annuity reinsurance contracts. Because our portfolio is in runoff, many of the provisions of the new standards don't apply to our books. The most meaningful change is the requirement to update the discount rate on our reserves each quarter with the impact reflected in other comprehensive income. All prior periods have been restated as required by the new accounting standard, which was most impactful to our other comprehensive income for 2022 given the significant increases in interest rates throughout the year. The impact of updating the discount rate for our life and annuity benefit reserve as of December 31, 2022, resulted in a net benefit of $89.6 million to the accumulated other comprehensive loss compared to the amount we previously reported. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was 20%. The estimated annual effective tax rate is 22% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 21% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $489 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $52 million in the same period a year ago, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $646 million compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $512 million in the first quarter of 2022, with both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as the largest drivers. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Turning to cash flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $284 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $415 million for the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines but most significantly within our underwriting operations given the strong premium volume in recent periods. Within our underwriting operations, operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 were net of a $125 million payment made to complete a retroactive reinsurance transaction to seed our runoff book of UK motor casualty business. Total shareholders' equity stood at $13.7 billion at the end of March compared to $13.2 billion at the end of the year. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 63,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, which is consistent with the number of shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2022. All in all, we are pleased with the start of the year, producing strong results that reflect the benefit of our three engine architectures. We're confident in the strength of our business and the contribution each makes in building shareholder value over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about the insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Teri. Great to have you here. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to recap our 2023 first quarter insurance engine results. We are off to a nice start to the year with total revenues within the insurance engines that are passing $2 billion for the quarter, generating pretax operating income of $152 million and increasing float while we invested in increasingly attractive yields. Let me now share a few thoughts on our first quarter results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and the fill insurance linked securities operations. Looking first at our insurance segment. For decades, we've said we will walk away from business that is not adequately priced and does not meet our profitability targets. The first quarter of this year is a good example of us displaying rate adequacy discipline. Top line gross written premium growth within our insurance segment came in at 8%. That being said, we actually grew nicely in a number of product areas where we have a high degree of confidence around margins. We took advantage of improved pricing environment in property and grew in areas such as inland marine, binding, personal lines and select London market Marine and Energy classes. However, we are not comfortable with the pricing trend in the professional liability space, particularly in much of the large account D&O space. As a result, we are shrinking, selectively allowing some business to lapse and being very discerning around new accounts. Another example is in excess casualty lines where we saw some contraction as the pace of new business slows a bit and we are pushing hard for rate and are willing to let existing business laps where we are able to get it. We are doing what we said we will do. Another highlight for this quarter is that we continue to see benefits from our actions taken to minimize volatility in our underwriting results through actively managing our net expenditures to natural catastrophes. We experienced minimal losses in the quarter from winter or confective storm events. Within our insurance operations, we produced a combined ratio of 94, up 7 points from a year ago due to higher attritional loss ratio and prior accident year's loss ratio, which admittedly is above our target. However, we are confident about the strength of our current portfolio, while also displaying caution as we acknowledge the current level of uncertainty around insurance market conditions at the moment. Another area where we remain consistent and do as we say is with regards to our loss reserving philosophy. We continue to take a cautious view on loss reserving given the continued uncertainty in the market around loss trends and impacts from various forms of inflation, in particular within our longer tail professional and general liability lines. Over the past few quarters, we've raised our attritional loss ratios in many of our general liability and professional liability subclasses as these trends have become more apparent, leading to a year-over-year increase in the attritional loss ratio within our insurance operations. We also increased our current year loss ratio within our professional liability lines this quarter due to exposures arising from the recent bank failures. We also are maintaining a cautious approach relative to prior accident year loss takedowns. Prior year favorable development is lower year-over-year as we saw minimal development across our general liability and professional liability product lines compared to more favorable development a year ago. We continue to be quick to strengthen reserves in the pre-COVID soft market accident years when we see or anticipate increased claims activity. Encouragingly, we are seeing favorable actual versus expected trends in the more recent accident years. Given our conservative reserving approach, we are generally holding off on releasing reserves and allowing more time to gain greater certainty over the longer term loss trends. Turning next to our reinsurance segment. I am pleased to report that we continue to show profitability improvement with a 91 combined ratio for the quarter compared to a 95 a year ago. Our reunderwriting actions within the portfolio over the past few years continue to show up in the reinsurance results. The 4% decrease in gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment was due to lower premiums in our professional liability and credit and surety lines, partially offset by higher premiums in our general liability and Marine and Energy lines. All of these movements are largely attributed to either premium adjustment activity or timing differences related to renewals. This is most notable in our transaction liability book within our profession liability product line where deal flows dropped considerably over the past few quarters, resulting in lower ultimate premium volumes. Lower premium adjustment activity creates an increase in our current year attritional loss ratio, which is offset by a decrease in our prior accident year's loss ratio. Next, I'll touch on our program services and other fronting operations and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Our Nephila ILS and State National program services teams continue to remain focused on capturing market opportunities, building their value proposition to clients and partnering with our underwriting divisions to take advantage of synergies available within our multifaceted insurance platform. As a reminder, almost all of our gross written premium from our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $778 million this year versus $879 million a year ago. Premium decrease was due to a termination of certain programs, which was expected. Terminations will occur in part because periodically a partner obtains a rating agency increase of regulator, licensing approval or is acquired and moves away from needing a fronting model. The good news is that we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market and our ability to handle more complex transactions in this space differentiates us from competitors. Within the Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the year were down due to the impact of selling our Velocity and Volante MGA operations last year, as well as from the impact of lower assets under management, which stands at $7.2 billion at the end of the period. As a reminder, we realized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter last year related to the sale of a majority stake in our Velocity MGA operations. While our current results in Nephila reflect lower levels of AUM being experienced, we continue to work hard to raise capital across all three of our strategies, property catastrophe, climate and specialty loans. Current pricing environment and property when combined with our initiatives around transparency of risk assessment and portfolio construction leads us to conclude that the risk return proposition is as compelling as it has ever been. Turning to market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities generally remained strong in the first quarter outside of professional lines. Clients are still turning to specialty market solutions given current levels of uncertainty and ongoing economic activity. Our diverse product and risk management capabilities, our specialty underwriting expertise and strong reputation in the marketplace are particularly compelling in more uncertain times like these. Just a couple of comments on rate. Across our portfolio, rates are holding up fairly well and broadly in our estimation are keeping up with our view of trend. We have many products where rates are up 5% to 10%, particularly most lines where rate adequacy is more in focus. The biggest exceptions are property to the good with rates accelerating more meaningfully from the start of the year and risk managed large account D&O to the bad, where prices continue to decrease. Rate increases in large account excess casualty have also continued to slow, which concerns us. I want to reiterate that we are focused on achieving rate adequacy across the entirety of our portfolio and where we are unable to attain sufficient rate increases or effectively adjust terms and conditions or limits, we are walking away from accounts that do not meet our profitability targets. These actions may have the effect of slowing the growth trend from what we've seen over the past couple of years. And given the breadth of product offering we have, we are confident we will fund pockets that are attractive to grow, and we remain very optimistic around our mid and longer term profitable growth objectives. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. At Markel Ventures, we enjoyed a wonderful first quarter. As Teri reported, revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up from $950 million. That growth was almost entirely organic as there were no ventures acquisitions in 2022. EBITDA grew to $120 million, up from $96 million a year ago. It is indeed appropriate to remember that the D of EBITDA is a real cash expense. Capital expenditures in the first quarter, which you can find in the statement of cash flows in the financial statements and which lead to the accrual accounting calculation of D totaled $37 million for all of Markel in the first quarter. Most of that does relate to Markel Ventures, but I hope that calculation gives you some comfort that remain attentive to the ultimate free cash flows that the ventures businesses generate after all cash expenses. The management teams that run our ventures operations continue to demonstrate operational excellence, creativity, adaptability and discipline amidst an ongoing jumbled economic environment. Inflationary pressures are real and the economic fallout from higher interest rates as well as overall tightening credit condition makes the job of delivering those sorts of results harder and harder. I could not be more grateful and proud of the team for how they continue to manage through the daily challenges of running their businesses. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we are starting to have some early conversations with people looking to join the Markel Ventures family, and I would hope that some of them will come to fruition in the fullness of time. We will be thoughtful and disciplined stewards of your capital as we consider possibilities. In our investment operations, we reported recurring investment income of $159 million, up from $92 million a year ago. That reflects the higher interest rates we're receiving as we invest the cash flows of our normal operations. I expect that number to continue climbing given the current levels of interest rates. In our equity holdings, we enjoyed a positive return of 5.3% during the first quarter. Our unrealized gain reached $4.9 billion and we have invested an additional net $65 million into our publicly traded equity portfolio. I would also point out that in both our equity and fixed income operations, we have nothing to report to you about the recent headlines of bank failures, real estate defaults or other bursts of speculative bubbles. We simply weren't there. We were at home, doing our homework, rushing our capes, eating vegetables and going to bed at a reasonable hour. We were having fun in our own way. To sum up, I'm delighted with our position. We continue to build balance sheet strength. GAAP accounting statements captured that well. In the case of our insurance and investment operations, GAAP accounting doesn't do as good a job capturing the intrinsic value growth of our ventures operations. That value doesn't show up in the balance sheet in the same way that it does with insurance and investments. That doesn't make that growth any less rear. As I consider our overall position at Markel, I feel a little bit like Buzz Lightyear when he says, to infinity and beyond, are on the way. So with that, I'll now open the floor for your questions about galactic and existential issues, insurance market pricing trends, tax rates or anything else you'd like to talk about. Chauntelle, would you be just kind enough to just open the floor?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Charles Goard with Truist.\nCharles Goard: Congratulations on the continued progress. I had a question about share repurchases. I know you have a program that automatically increases your appetite as the price is lower. Does that program eliminate all restrictions of the window being open or not open?\nTom Gayner: Well, you're correct that we try to do what we think is rational. So we make our own intrinsic calculation of what we think Markel is worth, and we make rational repurchase decisions based on that calculation and the other capital allocation opportunities that we look at. We have designed this to be able to try to be consistent in our ability to repurchase stock on a regular basis.\nCharles Goard: And the window question. Are you able to buy stock this morning?\nTom Gayner: The answer to that is yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle: A couple of questions. First, I noticed that there was a notable reserve release related to the CATCo unit, I guess that ran through the other segment. I guess what I wanted to check is sort of an accounting question ultimately, is that amount that benefit that shows up in the other segment, is that ultimately then neutralized by a higher minority interest or minority interest charge down further in the financial statements?\nJeremy Noble: That's right. So you may recall, we entered the settlement first quarter last year. And as part of that, we consolidate the Markel CATCo Re in the Markel's financial statement. So you just get noise above the line and below the line. So it shows up as you point out in the other operations and then it's eliminated below the line through noncontrolling interest change. So what that highlights is that the reserves continue to run off favorably and that inures to the benefit of the investors.\nMark Dwelle: Just a side question on that, I think that was my main point was really just that it ultimately doesn't hit the run rate earnings. But to the extent that you have that favorable development this quarter. Was that the byproduct of a reserve analysis or review or was that some continued innovations as that book continues to run down?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, it's more of the latter, Mark, just finalizing positions and commutation activity and just closing the deals out.\nMark Dwelle: The second question that I had related to I guess, the accident year margins in the insurance segment. I mean I appreciate that you guys have always been very conservative, and I suspect that will probably ultimately be the answer to the question I'm going to ask. But I mean it doesn't seem consistent to me that you could have a pricing environment where you're saying pricing is running level with or better than loss trend and then you would need 300 basis points more of accident year margin related to a book of business that is reasonably homogenous with the book you wrote a year ago. Can you just comment on that thought and where I might be off on that?\nJeremy Noble: Well, I think, Mark, you're right to kind of highlight that. So we clearly -- as we kind of spoke to throughout the course of last year, we were seeing confluence of that\u2019s rising interest rates that were compounding, social inflation becoming more clear, the effects of the courts working through their taste backlogs, and we witnessed actual loss frequency and severity in excess of our expectations. So we took action and ultimately that resulted in some adverse development in the fourth quarter, which as Tom alluded to earlier, we detest that. So what we're highlighting is acting with caution, acting with prudence. And you're exactly right, we will have built in an additional margin of safety in our '23 accident year and how we opened the year up as we continue to look to gain more credibility around how the 2020 to 2022 years are performing. Now fortunately, 2019 and prior, so the pre-COVID softer market years where we had experienced in development, we had some -- we didn't experience meaningful loss reserve development. We were pretty neutral on those years in total. The trends continue to be somewhat positive with regards to actual loss experience compared to expected 2020 to 2022. And to your point, we're actually probably doing a little bit better right now on rate to start '23 than we anticipated and also contemplation of rate and exposure change acting as rate relative to trend. So what we're left with is being cautious, acknowledging it's one quarter, acknowledging it's the first quarter of the year, allowing a little bit more time to apply credibility to the trends that we've seen and just acknowledging that there's uncertainty around insurance market conditions at the time. But I do think that, that is a bit of an extra layer of margin of safety right now.\nMark Dwelle: A question for you, Tom. I guess, within Markel Ventures, are you seeing any particular signs of the economic slowdown that CNBC tells me is occurring are all around me. Your 16% growth rate would suggest that's not so much the case, but it's obviously a very diverse book of businesses. So maybe some are doing superlative and some are kind of just chugging along\u2026\nTom Gayner: I don't want to dwell on the answers here to try to make economic forecast. But it is palpable that you could just feel the credit conditions, which during the first quarter wasn't until after the close of the quarter, they had some of the bank value issues and some headlines about office buildings or the keys being turned in. And we see and feel that a bit, but it's not the sort of thing we have any control over. And I do want to reiterate, I think the people running those businesses are just doing a fantastic job. And the spread of businesses that we have it's going to provide a wide degree of exposure to just general economic conditions. I just wouldn't draw any too much in the way of conclusions.\nMark Dwelle: So people are still buying a lot of house plants and stuff like that, right?\nTom Gayner: I know I feel better when I do. I was recommending the same for you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Fox with Fenimore Management.\nJohn Fox: First question for Jeremy. Program Services, you mentioned one client leaving for whatever reason, and it was a very tough compare. Do you expect that to grow for calendar 2023.\nJeremy Noble: I don't know that I want to be in the prediction game and grow quarter-over-quarter, grow in prior year comps. I'm not exactly sure even which one you'd be pointing to. Much of the activity that we would have anticipated with regards to changes in the programs was occurring over the back half of last year and into this year. But there still can be some changes in that space. As I think I commented on, fortunately, I think the new business pipeline is pretty strong. And to be honest with you, we were starting to see some -- we've commented before that there's rising levels of competition in a lot of new players and we're starting to see some cracks in some of that. So State National, I think, is very much a longstanding durable platform that has great relationships and is very good at dealing with larger and more complex deals. So that helps us get a lot of inbound calls and we feel pretty good about the new business pipeline, but I'm not going to predict where that will play out.\nJohn Fox: My second question for you, you know move on. When I think about the rhetoric in the industry, it's rate increases on top of rate increases and compounding for a number of years, more business moving to the E&S marketplace. And then as we've been through your gross written premium growth was 8%, which is the lowest in a while and your retention was a little bit lower than the previous year. And so on the one hand, the industry rhetoric is how great premium increases are and you're slowing down. So I know you've addressed this a couple of times, but any other reaction to that in my comment.\nJeremy Noble: I think what we've been talking about for a period of time, John, is that it's a little bit more of a nuanced market. So there's a story within various product lines and that was a little bit of what I was trying to bring out in my earlier comments. You could take professional lines and we write a lot of professional liability. The lack of activity around specs and leasebacks and IPOs, I mean across the industry has reduced the total flow of business in that space above and beyond just what's happening in the pricing environment that makes us pull back a little bit, if you will. But then we see other pockets where we opportunistically believe we can grow, and we did grow in the first quarter, binding in inland marine and personal lines and London market marine and energy classes. So we'll see how that portfolio balances. But some of those pockets on the general liability and professional liability side are pretty big segments of our book where we're a little bit more focused on rate adequacy and we're going to push. And if we just don't get the rate that we believe is appropriate, we're willing to let some of that business lapse. So there's a bunch that's going into that story. But what I would say is I think that net-net, that leads to a more healthy and even potentially a more balanced portfolio.\nJohn Fox: And I mean, it was great to see reinsurance premium down and profits up. So that was a great job. And for Tom, I was wondering if you could just give us some more detail. You have about $2 billion of CMBS and you alluded to the problems in the market that we're all aware of. But could you talk about the CMBS, how much is government guaranteed, how much is private? And any other kind of details you can give us on the risk of that holding.\nTom Gayner: The vast majority of it is indeed agency and government guarantee sort of things. The business that would not be would tend to be stuff that we inherited through some of the acquisitions we've done over the years, and we sort of let that continue to diminish and run off, and we obviously scrutinize that and look at it. We have no concerns about any exposure to things that look vulnerable to us at this point.\nJohn Fox: And I just want to confirm, I mean, you don't disclose it, but you don't have any loan participations or financed any commercial office buildings or whole loans or anything like that.\nTom Gayner: No.\nJohn Fox: So it's all in liquid CMBS.\nTom Gayner: Correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Farnam with Janney.\nBob Farnam: My question is probably similar to ones you've already answered. But I just wanted to get your current thoughts on your 10-5-1 aspirational goals. In light of the underwriting discipline and the caution you're mentioning, the rate increase is slowing, the pulling back from certain lines and the over pressure on loss trends. It seems like, at least to me, you can either get the premium goal or the profitability goal, but probably not both. And I just wanted to know what your thoughts are on that.\nJeremy Noble: So I think it's important to add some context to what we mean and what we've talked about with that vision around sort of 10-5-1, which is to say, back in 2019 when we sort of started to establish the idea, we really were talking about what would need to be true and what would we look like if we were to double the size of the company. Now numerically, that was an acknowledgment of $10 billion of premium by 2025. And because of our focus on profitability, we sort of established that $1 billion profit target. But what underpinned all of that was to say what needs to be true with regards to talent, to product, distribution, to territory, to region, to technology, to data, the digital capabilities, all of those sorts of things. So we continue to invest to make ourselves a bigger, more resilient, more durable, more longstanding insurance operation. So if we get to the end of 2025 and all those things I rattled off, we're doing really well out in line with what our expectations are and the premium is not at $10 billion, I'm not going to be terribly concerned because we acknowledge we have to operate through a market cycle. And as you hopefully would appreciate, for decades, we have spoken to the fact that we are about underwriting profitability. That's an incredibly important component part of how we contribute to the overall engines and dynamics of the Markel Corporation. So we're going to be focused on underwriting profitability and we can still achieve a lot of those objectives. We'll see on growth, that's about managing the market cycle. That being said, that breadth of product offering, the diversification we have, there are plenty of ways that we can grow across a very broad product set. So I think I still feel pretty good about mid and longer term profitable growth objectives. And we're not holding ourselves to a number.\nBob Farnam: No, I agree that you're aspirational. So I know this is not a set and start or anything like that. So yes, I was just curious to see if there were any updated thoughts. So thanks for the context.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Tom Gayner for closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you so much for joining us. We would love to see you at our annual meeting in Richmond on May 17th at 2:00 p.m., at Robin Center at the University of Virginia. Between now and then, we'll see you soon. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you, Chauntelle. And welcome to the first quarter Markel conference call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, your CEO and I'm joined today by my new colleague, Teri Gendron, who started as our CFO in mid March. I'll remind you that means she was here for all of two weeks of our first quarter. Given that tenure, we will probably ask her all of the really hard questions. Additionally, Jeremy Noble, President of our insurance operations is also on the call with us today. As always, we remind you that at Markel we focus on the long term. We have been in business since 1930, through three generations of the Markel family and have been public since 1986. Every action we take remains focused on the long term success of Markel. All of us are committed to building one of the world's great companies. We define a great company as one driven by win, win, win architecture. We do our best to make sure that our customers win by doing business with us, that our associates win by being part of this organization, and that our shareholders win through high and durable returns on their capital. We are more oriented towards time frames of 90 years than the 90 days that make up quarter, but we do enjoy the process of sharing our quarterly reports card with you. You are the owners of this business and we appreciate the chance to discuss how things are going, what we are working on and any highlights or low-lights happening at your company. We look forward to your thoughtful questions on our circumstances. As to 2023, we have got good news to share with you. We are off to a good start. As David Letterman might say, compared to the negative headlines that tend to dominate the news, here's today's list of the top 10 things to be happy about as a shareholder of Markel. Number 10, all three engines of Markel produced positive results in the first quarter. The beauty of the design of our three engine system is that as long as any single one of them is doing well that can create enough thrust to drive the whole shift forward. Not all three will always be positive in every quarter and every year. But in the vast majority of quarters and years, we make forward progress. The first quarter of 2023 was one where there was positive thrust in insurance, ventures and investments. Number 9, earned premiums in our insurance operations grew to $1.97 billion, up from $1.76 billion a year ago. We continue to produce profitable growth through careful and disciplined underwriting. Number 8, the insurance operations produced meaningful underwriting profits. While our combined ratio of 94 has been above our targets, we are proud of that result. It reflects both underwriting discipline and a commitment to integrity and conservatism in the way we report these results to you. As we state consistently, we wish our loss reserves to be more likely to be redundant than efficient. We continue to meet that crucial goal as witnessed by yet another quarterly report with favorable development of prior year reserves. We do not accomplish that 100% of the time but we get pretty darn close to meeting that standard. While we remain in an environment of inflationary pressures, both social and monetary, I think that continuing to report reserve redundancies is a big accomplishment. We remain committed to that goal as we have been for decades. Number seven, recurring investment income grew to $159 million, up from $92 million as we continue to invest at higher and higher interest rates. Number six, our ventures operations set records in revenues and EBITDA. That growth was almost entirely organic as we didn't do any acquisitions during 2022. It's an apples-to-apples comparison. Number five, we continue to purchase attractively priced publicly traded equity securities that met our four part test of buying profitable businesses with good returns on capital and not too much leverage, run by managers with equal measures of talent and integrity, with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline at fair prices. During the first quarter, we bought a net of $65 million of public securities. Number four, we continue to repurchase our own shares. During the first quarter, we bought $81 million of Markel shares. Our recurring investment income largely provided the cash we used to buy additional common stocks and our own shares. Number three, our unrealized gain on our portfolio of publicly traded equities reached $4.9 billion. Number two, while there is no mark-to-market of the value of our Markel Ventures operations captured by GAAP accounting, I would assert that record revenues and EBITDA would strongly suggest that those businesses continue to increase in value. Number one, inbound phone calls for potential acquisitions started to reappear during the first quarter. This seems like a logical consequence of the disruption caused by rising interest rates and volatility in financial markets, and that ought to lead to opportunities for us over time. The net of all these things is that Markel continues to produce wins for our customers, our associates and our shareholders across the board. With that, I'll turn it over to Teri to provide you with numbers that flesh out some specifics behind the top 10 list. Jeremy will then pick up some commentary on our insurance operations, and then I'll follow up with a few thoughts about ventures and investing. And after that, we'll take your questions. Teri? Thank you, Jeremy. At Markel Ventures, we enjoyed a wonderful first quarter. As Teri reported, revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up from $950 million. That growth was almost entirely organic as there were no ventures acquisitions in 2022. EBITDA grew to $120 million, up from $96 million a year ago. It is indeed appropriate to remember that the D of EBITDA is a real cash expense. Capital expenditures in the first quarter, which you can find in the statement of cash flows in the financial statements and which lead to the accrual accounting calculation of D totaled $37 million for all of Markel in the first quarter. Most of that does relate to Markel Ventures, but I hope that calculation gives you some comfort that remain attentive to the ultimate free cash flows that the ventures businesses generate after all cash expenses. The management teams that run our ventures operations continue to demonstrate operational excellence, creativity, adaptability and discipline amidst an ongoing jumbled economic environment. Inflationary pressures are real and the economic fallout from higher interest rates as well as overall tightening credit condition makes the job of delivering those sorts of results harder and harder. I could not be more grateful and proud of the team for how they continue to manage through the daily challenges of running their businesses. As I mentioned earlier in the call, we are starting to have some early conversations with people looking to join the Markel Ventures family, and I would hope that some of them will come to fruition in the fullness of time. We will be thoughtful and disciplined stewards of your capital as we consider possibilities. In our investment operations, we reported recurring investment income of $159 million, up from $92 million a year ago. That reflects the higher interest rates we're receiving as we invest the cash flows of our normal operations. I expect that number to continue climbing given the current levels of interest rates. In our equity holdings, we enjoyed a positive return of 5.3% during the first quarter. Our unrealized gain reached $4.9 billion and we have invested an additional net $65 million into our publicly traded equity portfolio. I would also point out that in both our equity and fixed income operations, we have nothing to report to you about the recent headlines of bank failures, real estate defaults or other bursts of speculative bubbles. We simply weren't there. We were at home, doing our homework, rushing our capes, eating vegetables and going to bed at a reasonable hour. We were having fun in our own way. To sum up, I'm delighted with our position. We continue to build balance sheet strength. GAAP accounting statements captured that well. In the case of our insurance and investment operations, GAAP accounting doesn't do as good a job capturing the intrinsic value growth of our ventures operations. That value doesn't show up in the balance sheet in the same way that it does with insurance and investments. That doesn't make that growth any less rear. As I consider our overall position at Markel, I feel a little bit like Buzz Lightyear when he says, to infinity and beyond, are on the way. So with that, I'll now open the floor for your questions about galactic and existential issues, insurance market pricing trends, tax rates or anything else you'd like to talk about. Chauntelle, would you be just kind enough to just open the floor? Well, you're correct that we try to do what we think is rational. So we make our own intrinsic calculation of what we think Markel is worth, and we make rational repurchase decisions based on that calculation and the other capital allocation opportunities that we look at. We have designed this to be able to try to be consistent in our ability to repurchase stock on a regular basis. The answer to that is yes. I don't want to dwell on the answers here to try to make economic forecast. But it is palpable that you could just feel the credit conditions, which during the first quarter wasn't until after the close of the quarter, they had some of the bank value issues and some headlines about office buildings or the keys being turned in. And we see and feel that a bit, but it's not the sort of thing we have any control over. And I do want to reiterate, I think the people running those businesses are just doing a fantastic job. And the spread of businesses that we have it's going to provide a wide degree of exposure to just general economic conditions. I just wouldn't draw any too much in the way of conclusions. I know I feel better when I do. I was recommending the same for you. The vast majority of it is indeed agency and government guarantee sort of things. The business that would not be would tend to be stuff that we inherited through some of the acquisitions we've done over the years, and we sort of let that continue to diminish and run off, and we obviously scrutinize that and look at it. We have no concerns about any exposure to things that look vulnerable to us at this point. No. Correct. Thank you so much for joining us. We would love to see you at our annual meeting in Richmond on May 17th at 2:00 p.m., at Robin Center at the University of Virginia. Between now and then, we'll see you soon. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I couldn't be happier to be part of the Markel team. It's been just a short while but I can already see the role the Markel culture plays in our long term success. Onto our first quarter results. As Tom remarked, 2023 is off to a good start, reflecting growth in meaningful contributions from each of our three engines. Starting off with our underwriting operations. Gross written premiums were $2.7 billion for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in 2022, an increase of 6%. Our increased premium volume reflects new business volume and more favorable rates across many of the product lines within our insurance segment with the most notable growth coming from our personal lines, property and marine and energy product lines, while we saw lower premium volume within our professional liability product lines, where we are adjusting our writings in reaction to changes in market conditions and downward pressure on rates within certain classes. Retention of gross written premiums was 83% in 2023, which is down 3 points from the same period last year. The lower retention in 2023 compared to 2022 reflects higher session rates on our professional liability and personal lines product lines within the insurance segment and our marine and energy product lines within the Reinsurance segment, as well as changes in mix of business within the Reinsurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter of 2023 was 94%. This compared to an 89% for the first quarter last year, which included $35 million or 2 points of net losses and loss adjustment expenses attributed to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The increase in the consolidated combined ratio reflects a higher attritional loss ratio and the impact of less favorable development on prior accident year's loss reserves in 2023 compared to 2022 within our insurance segment. Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $71 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $96 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease was due to favorable development on our general liability and professional liability product lines in our insurance segment in '22, which we did not experienced in 2023. We remain cautious and conservative in our approach to reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer tail general liability and professional liability lines, given the current uncertain economic environment. Turning to our investment results. Net investment gains were $373 million in the first quarter of 2023 and reflect an increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by favorable market value movements. This compares to net investment losses of $358 million for the comparable quarter in 2022, which reflected a decrease in the fair value of our equity portfolio, driven by unfavorable market value movements. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets and the timing of investment gains and losses from period to period. We will continue to measure investment returns over longer periods of time. At the end of March, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative unrealized holding gains of $4.9 billion. With regard to net investment income, we reported $159 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $92 million in the same period last year. The increase is largely attributable to higher interest income from our money market and short term investments due to higher short term interest rates in 2023. Additionally, interest income on our fixed maturity securities increased, reflecting a higher yield and higher average holdings compared to last year. The change in net unrealized investment losses included in other comprehensive income for the first quarter of 2023 net of taxes was an increase of $164 million compared to a decrease of $521 million in 2022. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and we generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. Our fixed maturity portfolio had an average rating of AAA as of March 31st, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 16% to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2023, up from $950 million for the comparable quarter last year. The increase reflects strong organic growth and improved pricing across many of our businesses. EBITDA from Markel Ventures increased 25% to $120 million for the first quarter of 2023 from $96 million during the same period last year. The increase reflects higher revenues and improved operating results at our transportation related and equipment manufacturing businesses. Before turning to the consolidated results for the quarter, there's one new item I'd like to draw your attention to related to the new accounting standard on long duration insurance contracts that we adopted January 1st, which impacts our portfolio of life and annuity reinsurance contracts. Because our portfolio is in runoff, many of the provisions of the new standards don't apply to our books. The most meaningful change is the requirement to update the discount rate on our reserves each quarter with the impact reflected in other comprehensive income. All prior periods have been restated as required by the new accounting standard, which was most impactful to our other comprehensive income for 2022 given the significant increases in interest rates throughout the year. The impact of updating the discount rate for our life and annuity benefit reserve as of December 31, 2022, resulted in a net benefit of $89.6 million to the accumulated other comprehensive loss compared to the amount we previously reported. Looking at our consolidated results for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was 20%. The estimated annual effective tax rate is 22% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to 21% in the same period last year. We reported net income to common shareholders of $489 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to a net loss to common shareholders of $52 million in the same period a year ago, largely attributed to the year-over-year swing in changes to our public equity portfolio valuation. Comprehensive income to shareholders for the first quarter of 2023 was $646 million compared to comprehensive loss to shareholders of $512 million in the first quarter of 2022, with both fixed maturity and public equity valuations as the largest drivers. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows, capital and our balance sheet. Turning to cash flows, net cash provided by operating activities was $284 million for the first quarter of 2023 compared to $415 million for the first quarter of last year. Operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines but most significantly within our underwriting operations given the strong premium volume in recent periods. Within our underwriting operations, operating cash flows in the first quarter of 2023 were net of a $125 million payment made to complete a retroactive reinsurance transaction to seed our runoff book of UK motor casualty business. Total shareholders' equity stood at $13.7 billion at the end of March compared to $13.2 billion at the end of the year. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased 63,000 shares of our stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, which is consistent with the number of shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2022. All in all, we are pleased with the start of the year, producing strong results that reflect the benefit of our three engine architectures. We're confident in the strength of our business and the contribution each makes in building shareholder value over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about the insurance engine."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Teri. Great to have you here. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be with you today to recap our 2023 first quarter insurance engine results. We are off to a nice start to the year with total revenues within the insurance engines that are passing $2 billion for the quarter, generating pretax operating income of $152 million and increasing float while we invested in increasingly attractive yields. Let me now share a few thoughts on our first quarter results from across our collection of insurance businesses, which include our insurance and reinsurance underwriting operations, State National Program Services operations and the fill insurance linked securities operations. Looking first at our insurance segment. For decades, we've said we will walk away from business that is not adequately priced and does not meet our profitability targets. The first quarter of this year is a good example of us displaying rate adequacy discipline. Top line gross written premium growth within our insurance segment came in at 8%. That being said, we actually grew nicely in a number of product areas where we have a high degree of confidence around margins. We took advantage of improved pricing environment in property and grew in areas such as inland marine, binding, personal lines and select London market Marine and Energy classes. However, we are not comfortable with the pricing trend in the professional liability space, particularly in much of the large account D&O space. As a result, we are shrinking, selectively allowing some business to lapse and being very discerning around new accounts. Another example is in excess casualty lines where we saw some contraction as the pace of new business slows a bit and we are pushing hard for rate and are willing to let existing business laps where we are able to get it. We are doing what we said we will do. Another highlight for this quarter is that we continue to see benefits from our actions taken to minimize volatility in our underwriting results through actively managing our net expenditures to natural catastrophes. We experienced minimal losses in the quarter from winter or confective storm events. Within our insurance operations, we produced a combined ratio of 94, up 7 points from a year ago due to higher attritional loss ratio and prior accident year's loss ratio, which admittedly is above our target. However, we are confident about the strength of our current portfolio, while also displaying caution as we acknowledge the current level of uncertainty around insurance market conditions at the moment. Another area where we remain consistent and do as we say is with regards to our loss reserving philosophy. We continue to take a cautious view on loss reserving given the continued uncertainty in the market around loss trends and impacts from various forms of inflation, in particular within our longer tail professional and general liability lines. Over the past few quarters, we've raised our attritional loss ratios in many of our general liability and professional liability subclasses as these trends have become more apparent, leading to a year-over-year increase in the attritional loss ratio within our insurance operations. We also increased our current year loss ratio within our professional liability lines this quarter due to exposures arising from the recent bank failures. We also are maintaining a cautious approach relative to prior accident year loss takedowns. Prior year favorable development is lower year-over-year as we saw minimal development across our general liability and professional liability product lines compared to more favorable development a year ago. We continue to be quick to strengthen reserves in the pre-COVID soft market accident years when we see or anticipate increased claims activity. Encouragingly, we are seeing favorable actual versus expected trends in the more recent accident years. Given our conservative reserving approach, we are generally holding off on releasing reserves and allowing more time to gain greater certainty over the longer term loss trends. Turning next to our reinsurance segment. I am pleased to report that we continue to show profitability improvement with a 91 combined ratio for the quarter compared to a 95 a year ago. Our reunderwriting actions within the portfolio over the past few years continue to show up in the reinsurance results. The 4% decrease in gross written premiums within the Reinsurance segment was due to lower premiums in our professional liability and credit and surety lines, partially offset by higher premiums in our general liability and Marine and Energy lines. All of these movements are largely attributed to either premium adjustment activity or timing differences related to renewals. This is most notable in our transaction liability book within our profession liability product line where deal flows dropped considerably over the past few quarters, resulting in lower ultimate premium volumes. Lower premium adjustment activity creates an increase in our current year attritional loss ratio, which is offset by a decrease in our prior accident year's loss ratio. Next, I'll touch on our program services and other fronting operations and ILS operations, both of which are reported as part of our other operations. Our Nephila ILS and State National program services teams continue to remain focused on capturing market opportunities, building their value proposition to clients and partnering with our underwriting divisions to take advantage of synergies available within our multifaceted insurance platform. As a reminder, almost all of our gross written premium from our program services and other fronting operations is ceded. Total premium production within our program services and other fronting operations totaled $778 million this year versus $879 million a year ago. Premium decrease was due to a termination of certain programs, which was expected. Terminations will occur in part because periodically a partner obtains a rating agency increase of regulator, licensing approval or is acquired and moves away from needing a fronting model. The good news is that we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities in the current market and our ability to handle more complex transactions in this space differentiates us from competitors. Within the Nephila ILS operations, revenues and expenses for the year were down due to the impact of selling our Velocity and Volante MGA operations last year, as well as from the impact of lower assets under management, which stands at $7.2 billion at the end of the period. As a reminder, we realized a gain of $107 million in the first quarter last year related to the sale of a majority stake in our Velocity MGA operations. While our current results in Nephila reflect lower levels of AUM being experienced, we continue to work hard to raise capital across all three of our strategies, property catastrophe, climate and specialty loans. Current pricing environment and property when combined with our initiatives around transparency of risk assessment and portfolio construction leads us to conclude that the risk return proposition is as compelling as it has ever been. Turning to market commentary and outlook. Submission activity and new business opportunities generally remained strong in the first quarter outside of professional lines. Clients are still turning to specialty market solutions given current levels of uncertainty and ongoing economic activity. Our diverse product and risk management capabilities, our specialty underwriting expertise and strong reputation in the marketplace are particularly compelling in more uncertain times like these. Just a couple of comments on rate. Across our portfolio, rates are holding up fairly well and broadly in our estimation are keeping up with our view of trend. We have many products where rates are up 5% to 10%, particularly most lines where rate adequacy is more in focus. The biggest exceptions are property to the good with rates accelerating more meaningfully from the start of the year and risk managed large account D&O to the bad, where prices continue to decrease. Rate increases in large account excess casualty have also continued to slow, which concerns us. I want to reiterate that we are focused on achieving rate adequacy across the entirety of our portfolio and where we are unable to attain sufficient rate increases or effectively adjust terms and conditions or limits, we are walking away from accounts that do not meet our profitability targets. These actions may have the effect of slowing the growth trend from what we've seen over the past couple of years. And given the breadth of product offering we have, we are confident we will fund pockets that are attractive to grow, and we remain very optimistic around our mid and longer term profitable growth objectives. Thank you. And with that, I will turn things back over to Tom. That's right. So you may recall, we entered the settlement first quarter last year. And as part of that, we consolidate the Markel CATCo Re in the Markel's financial statement. So you just get noise above the line and below the line. So it shows up as you point out in the other operations and then it's eliminated below the line through noncontrolling interest change. So what that highlights is that the reserves continue to run off favorably and that inures to the benefit of the investors. Yes, it's more of the latter, Mark, just finalizing positions and commutation activity and just closing the deals out. Well, I think, Mark, you're right to kind of highlight that. So we clearly -- as we kind of spoke to throughout the course of last year, we were seeing confluence of that's rising interest rates that were compounding, social inflation becoming more clear, the effects of the courts working through their taste backlogs, and we witnessed actual loss frequency and severity in excess of our expectations. So we took action and ultimately that resulted in some adverse development in the fourth quarter, which as Tom alluded to earlier, we detest that. So what we're highlighting is acting with caution, acting with prudence. And you're exactly right, we will have built in an additional margin of safety in our '23 accident year and how we opened the year up as we continue to look to gain more credibility around how the 2020 to 2022 years are performing. Now fortunately, 2019 and prior, so the pre-COVID softer market years where we had experienced in development, we had some -- we didn't experience meaningful loss reserve development. We were pretty neutral on those years in total. The trends continue to be somewhat positive with regards to actual loss experience compared to expected 2020 to 2022. And to your point, we're actually probably doing a little bit better right now on rate to start '23 than we anticipated and also contemplation of rate and exposure change acting as rate relative to trend. So what we're left with is being cautious, acknowledging it's one quarter, acknowledging it's the first quarter of the year, allowing a little bit more time to apply credibility to the trends that we've seen and just acknowledging that there's uncertainty around insurance market conditions at the time. But I do think that, that is a bit of an extra layer of margin of safety right now. I don't know that I want to be in the prediction game and grow quarter-over-quarter, grow in prior year comps. I'm not exactly sure even which one you'd be pointing to. Much of the activity that we would have anticipated with regards to changes in the programs was occurring over the back half of last year and into this year. But there still can be some changes in that space. As I think I commented on, fortunately, I think the new business pipeline is pretty strong. And to be honest with you, we were starting to see some -- we've commented before that there's rising levels of competition in a lot of new players and we're starting to see some cracks in some of that. So State National, I think, is very much a longstanding durable platform that has great relationships and is very good at dealing with larger and more complex deals. So that helps us get a lot of inbound calls and we feel pretty good about the new business pipeline, but I'm not going to predict where that will play out. I think what we've been talking about for a period of time, John, is that it's a little bit more of a nuanced market. So there's a story within various product lines and that was a little bit of what I was trying to bring out in my earlier comments. You could take professional lines and we write a lot of professional liability. The lack of activity around specs and leasebacks and IPOs, I mean across the industry has reduced the total flow of business in that space above and beyond just what's happening in the pricing environment that makes us pull back a little bit, if you will. But then we see other pockets where we opportunistically believe we can grow, and we did grow in the first quarter, binding in inland marine and personal lines and London market marine and energy classes. So we'll see how that portfolio balances. But some of those pockets on the general liability and professional liability side are pretty big segments of our book where we're a little bit more focused on rate adequacy and we're going to push. And if we just don't get the rate that we believe is appropriate, we're willing to let some of that business lapse. So there's a bunch that's going into that story. But what I would say is I think that net-net, that leads to a more healthy and even potentially a more balanced portfolio. So I think it's important to add some context to what we mean and what we've talked about with that vision around sort of 10-5-1, which is to say, back in 2019 when we sort of started to establish the idea, we really were talking about what would need to be true and what would we look like if we were to double the size of the company. Now numerically, that was an acknowledgment of $10 billion of premium by 2025. And because of our focus on profitability, we sort of established that $1 billion profit target. But what underpinned all of that was to say what needs to be true with regards to talent, to product, distribution, to territory, to region, to technology, to data, the digital capabilities, all of those sorts of things. So we continue to invest to make ourselves a bigger, more resilient, more durable, more longstanding insurance operation. So if we get to the end of 2025 and all those things I rattled off, we're doing really well out in line with what our expectations are and the premium is not at $10 billion, I'm not going to be terribly concerned because we acknowledge we have to operate through a market cycle. And as you hopefully would appreciate, for decades, we have spoken to the fact that we are about underwriting profitability. That's an incredibly important component part of how we contribute to the overall engines and dynamics of the Markel Corporation. So we're going to be focused on underwriting profitability and we can still achieve a lot of those objectives. We'll see on growth, that's about managing the market cycle. That being said, that breadth of product offering, the diversification we have, there are plenty of ways that we can grow across a very broad product set. So I think I still feel pretty good about mid and longer term profitable growth objectives. And we're not holding ourselves to a number."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Perilla, and good morning. Thank you all for joining us. This is Tom Gayner, the CEO. I'm joined today by Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance Operations; and Brian Costanzo, our CFO. As always, we welcome the chance to share our latest financial updates and we look forward to your questions. I'll jump right in with the headlines. The Markel Group continues to move forward at a good clip. For the purposes of a thought exercise, I'd invite you to think of us as an aircraft. In any plane there are several gauges and monitors to measure the conditions of the plane. The same is true for the Markel Group. I'd like to share with you some of the key gauge readings I monitor and why I contend that this plane is moving forward at a pretty good clip. I can't imagine a plane without at least four absolutely mission critical gauges. On a complex plane like Markel Group, there are more but these four cannot be replaced. In my layman's mind and I don't know the first thing about being a pilot. The mission critical gauges measure speed, fuel, altitude and direction. Without speed, no aircraft can fly. Airplanes need to travel at a certain rate of speed to achieve a lift and remain airborne. Without fuel, the energy needed to power the engines to achieve speed won't work. As a pilot, I'm pretty sure you need to know how much fuel you have and whether it is enough to get you to your destination. Without altitude and awareness of the terrain, the plane might bump into something and that will not end well. Without knowing direction, everything might be working, but you may be headed to the wrong place. I'll offer the following analogy for those four gauges and measurements from our Markel Group. I'll also speak to them in the five year measurement terms that we monitor to determine whether our craft is functioning as it should. First, as of September 30, 2024, total net investments, that is our entire publicly traded investment portfolio plus cash minus debt, summed up to $30.3 billion. Five years ago, on September 30, 2019, that number stood at $18 billion. That's an increase of 68%. Second, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned underwriting and insurance operating income of $458 million compared to $249 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 84%. Third, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned $388 million of operating income and our Markel Ventures operations compared to $179 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 117%. Fourth, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned recurring dividend and interest income of $677 million compared to $339 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 99%. At September 30, 2024, each share of Markel Group sold for about $1,570. At September 30, 2019, each year Markel Group sold for $1,180. That's an increase of 33%. That is the smallest percentage increase of any of those numbers. I would suggest that the gauges measuring our total net investments, our underwriting and insurance earnings, our Markel Ventures earnings, and our recurring investment earnings would be the measurements that I, as your pilot and you as fellow shareholders should be monitoring. Those gauge readings are not perfect and in some cases they show that we fell short of what we strive for and what we expect going forward. Nonetheless, I think it's fair to assert that they describe an airworthy craft. In response to those measurements, which I believe describe genuine progress and our sense of intrinsic value, we've responded by repurchasing Markel Group shares. Five years ago, our share count stood at 13.815 million shares. At September 30, 2024, it stood at 12.887. Most of the repurchase activity took place starting in 2022 and it continues through this day. So far that's a decrease of about 6.7% in outstanding shares. We think given our valuation, capital position and capital allocation alternatives, that repurchasing shares makes sense, and as such we are doing so. In just a minute, Brian and Jeremy will descend from the five year measurement timeframe to the first nine months of 2024 and provide some relevant details and comments on our overall financial position and our insurance business. I will add in the spirit of shifting to annual comparisons that in our Markel Ventures operations we faced a tough comparison against the same period a year ago. Last year I spoke about conditions in some of our more cyclical businesses as white hot. At this point I would describe conditions as beige hot. That makes for tough year-over-year comparisons, but I remain very happy with the ongoing performance of the Markel Ventures collection of businesses. In our investment operations, we continue to benefit from persistent production of cash from our insurance and ventures operations as well as increased dividend and interest income and capital appreciation. In our insurance operations, we work to respond to the catastrophes and events to help clients in their times of need. We also work to continue to improve our financial performance while building the capital it takes to help our customers when they need it most. The sum of these positive flows combined give us the fuel to keep investing in publicly traded securities, fund acquisitions, fund growth opportunities and repurchase stock, and we keep seeming to have more money in the kitty. To me, that seems like a healthy set of gauge readings. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to lower the plane from the discussion about the cruising altitude of 39,000 feet towards ground level as we approach the runway of current year-to-date financial results. Following Brian, Jeremy will pick up some comments about our insurance operations and then we will open the floor for questions. Brian?\nBrian Costanzo: Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Through the first nine months of this year we saw terrific returns on our equity portfolio, adding $1.7 billion to operating income, which is the headline change in almost any consolidated metric. However, it's also important to note the aggregate growth in operating income from our underlying businesses, insurance and ventures, along with our recurring interest and dividends, which grew by double digits in both the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods. With that, let's go through the results, starting off with our consolidated results. Total revenues increased 15% to $12.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024, and total operating income increased significantly year-over-year to $3.1 billion, with the largest driver being the market value movements on our equity portfolio. Net income to common shareholders was $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in the same period of 2023. Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 was $2.5 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period of 2033. Net cash from operating activities was $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $2 billion in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines, with the most significant contribution coming from insurance. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased $389 million of Markel Group common stock under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $270 million in the same period last year. Now I'll move to the performance of each of our three operating engines, starting off with our insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew by 4% to $8.2 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $7.9 billion in the same period last year. Our premium growth was driven by select U.S. lines of business, most notably our personal lines, and our international marine and energy insurance and reinsurance products. This was partially offset by targeted premium contraction in select classes within our U.S. professional liability and general liability portfolios, where we took underwriting actions to improve profitability. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023 was 95%. Both periods included one point of catastrophe losses. Our 2024 combined ratio included $62 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Helene, while our 2023 combined ratio included $46 million of net losses attributed to the Hawaiian Wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. In addition, we disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q as a subsequent event, our preliminary estimated range for Hurricane Milton of between $40 million and $80 million in losses that will be recorded in the fourth quarter. These losses from catastrophe events are within our expectations for events of this size. In 2024, the combined ratio benefited from more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves compared to 2023, the impact of which was mostly offset by higher attritional losses including those on our intellectual property Collateral Protection Insurance or CPI product line. Our year-to-date 2024 consolidated combined ratio included $139 million or 2 points of losses from CPI, while our year-to-date 2023 consolidated combined ratio included $68 million or 1 point of losses from CPI. Prior year loss reserves development improved over the first nine months of 2024 to $344 million in loss takedowns versus $170 million in 2023. Favorable development in the first nine months of 2024 was most notable within our international professional liability product lines. We remain cautious in our approach to both reducing prior year loss reserves and in our current accident year attritional loss ratio on our longer tail U.S. professional liability and general liability product lines given recent claims trends. Within our program services and ILS operations, operating income totaled $101 million, primarily driven by strong growth and performance from our fronting operations both at State National and in support of Nephila. Turning next to our investment results. Net investment income for the first nine months of 2024 was $677 million compared to $520 million in the same period last year. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates compared to the first nine months of 2023. We expect based on the current interest rate environment that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher yielding securities. Net investment gains of $1.7 billion in 2024 reflect favorable market value movements resulting in an 18.5% return on our public equity portfolio in the first nine months of 2024. This compares to net investment gains of $591 million in the first nine months of 2023. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets from period-to-period. At the end of September, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pre-tax unrealized gains of $7.8 billion. Net unrealized investment gains included in other comprehensive income in the first nine months of 2024 were $283 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment losses of $135 million net of taxes last year. At the end of September, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized loss on our fixed maturity portfolio was $198 million. We typically hold our fixed maturity investments until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. We continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of September 30, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, I'll cover the results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 3% in the first nine months of 2024 versus the same period of 2023 driven by our consumer and building products businesses as well as the contribution from our June 2024 acquisition of Valor. Marco Ventures operating income decreased 1% due to the impact of lower revenues and operating margins at our construction services and transportation related businesses. This was largely offset by the impact of higher revenues and margins at our consumer and building products businesses. While our growth metrics are down slightly, many of our Markel Ventures companies are performing very well, but as Tom mentioned earlier, certain of our businesses, in particular our transportation businesses, are benchmarked against peak performance metrics from a year ago. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. Our work to build a more consistent top financial performer within our insurance operations continues to progress. Our underlying results within our U.S. insurance operations are steadily improving while our international operations continue to perform exceptionally well. While our third quarter combined ratio of 96 is not what we aspire to, this quarter's results were impacted by 3 points of losses related to Hurricane Helene and 2 points of losses on our intellectual Property Collateral Protection portfolio which is in runoff. For the year, our combined ratio sits at a 95 and includes 1 point of cat losses and 2 points of losses related to our CPI product. Regarding the ongoing effects of winding down our in force CPI portfolio, nothing has meaningfully changed from my comments a quarter ago, we continue to expect the majority of the loss activity to be resolved by the end of 2025. Throughout 2024, the insurance industry has seen elevated losses arising from natural catastrophe events beyond Hurricane Helene. While we are exposed to losses on these types of events, our incurred losses have been attritional in nature. Given the portfolio management actions we've made in recent years and our catastrophe exposed products remain profitable and contribute positively to our overall results. Our estimated Hurricane Milton losses which will be recognized in the fourth quarter do not change that position. Our overall risk bearing premium production continues to be affected by the underwriting actions we have been taking since late 2023. Within our insurance segment on select U.S. casualty and risk managed professional liability lines where the corrective underwriting actions have been most focused, premiums are down by over 20%. The remainder of our products where we are generally achieving our profitability targets are up 8%. We continue to see growth in many of our international lines, including within our marine and energy and trade credit products and across our international casualty, Europe and Asia portfolios where we have made investments in talent and expanded our product capabilities into additional markets. Within our domestic portfolio, our personal lines, inland marine, managed reliability and programs offerings, among others, continue to produce strong profitable growth. As we prepare to move into 2025, we plan to further grow in areas where we see opportunities for our specialist solutions. As Brian mentioned, our combined ratio for the year has benefited from a higher level of prior year reserve releases than a year ago. It's worth taking a moment to speak to this. First, our prior year loss reserves have benefited from higher reserve releases within our international portfolio. In aggregate, our international lines have behaved quite well with actual versus expected claim experience coming in favorably over the course of several quarters. These favorable trends have resulted in a reduction to reserves and lower ultimate loss ratios in line with claims experience while we continue to maintain a margin of safety in our reserves. Second, in the U.S., while we have some products where actual versus expected loss trends are behaving quite well, such as workers compensation, a significant portion of our reserve releases are a function of the overall reserving philosophy. As we have said before, we consistently reserve at a level to be more likely redundant than deficient. Each year we prudently layer on a margin of safety above our best estimate loss ratios within each product to acknowledge that uncertainty exists with loss development trends. Over time, if losses behave as expected, we will experience reserve releases, which has historically been the case. Given the elevated levels of adverse loss experience in our U.S. general liability and professional liability product lines during 2022 and 2023, we took action, including both adding reserves on older accident years given experience and increasing the margin of safety applied on more recent accident years. Overall prior development on our total reserves for U.S. casualty and professional product lines have been close to flat this year, while the rest of our insurance portfolio has performed well, which allows us to experience higher levels of reserve releases. In general, absent unexpected adverse trends in our claims development, we would expect to have meaningful reserve releases best demonstrated by our long-term track record of net reserve releases. Turning to our expense ratio, a few comments on recent trends. Our direct and controllable expense ratio in the insurance segment is elevated from prior years. We see this impact in the third quarter where the overall expense ratio eclipsed 35% in conjunction with our net earned premiums turning slightly negative. The vast majority of expenses arise from our insurance operations and there are different drivers contributing to this outcome. Within our international division we continue to see excellent performance and we have been investing in underwriting talent and systems to support further growth and expansion into new products and geographies. These investments are putting short-term pressure on our direct and controllable expense ratio. The strong results this year have also yielded higher profit-sharing expense commensurate with performance. So while the expense ratio is ticking up, so is overall profitability and the opportunities for future profitable growth. We feel good about our longer-term prospects here. Within our specialty operations we have seen compression in the earned premiums driven by our corrective underwriting actions and changes in our professional liability outwards reinsurance structure. These top line impacts have put pressure on our expense base that remains subject to inflationary trends from higher salaries and professional fees and is impacted by targeted investments in technology that we are making. Our earned premium growth had continued similar to previous years, we would be producing a more consistent expense ratio. Our elevated expense ratio was anticipated but also remains an area of focus for improvement in the future. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to successfully re underwrite our portfolio and return to more historical levels of growth which will alleviate pressure on the expense ratio and yield even stronger results over the long-term. At this point, I've largely covered off our insurance segment results so let me take a minute to discuss our other divisions. Starting with our Global Reinsurance division. We remain singularly focused on writing profitable business deal by deal only deploying capital on deals that meet our underwriting criteria and profitability targets. We recently announced the exit of our public entity product line which has been a significant drag on results the past few years due to ongoing legal system abuse trends prevalent within the casualty market. If you exclude the impact from our public entity line, our reinsurance segment result for the year, our overall result for the segment would be modestly profitable. Our state national program services operations achieved significant growth of 22% through nine months while maintaining consistent levels of high profitability. We also continue to differentiate ourselves within the funding market with our ability to facilitate and place complex and unique transactions. Our team has demonstrated its ability to innovate find new ways to create value around our core competencies. Within our Nephila operations, our portfolios have performed well despite elevated levels of natural catastrophe activity. As I mentioned earlier this year, given the elevated climate signal, we deployed less capacity, partially hedged our portfolios and wrote less premium volume than we otherwise would have. These actions lowered revenues and therefore earnings this year, but were in the best long-term interest of our investors. Given current views of investment returns and the increased likelihood of an attractive pricing environment again for 2025, we feel we are well positioned heading into the new year. With that, I will turn it back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy. And with that, Perilla, we'd love to open the floor for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Anderson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Andersen: Hi, good morning. With the corrective underwriting actions on U.S. general liability and professional liability that I believe began in fourth quarter of last year, how many quarters of a drag do you think there is left on growth here?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, Andrew, it's Jeremy. I'm not going to give too much guidance on that, but I will say you're exactly correct. We started obviously recognizing loss reserve development in '22 and '23, and we began taking really more impactful corrective underwriting actions, as we entered the first quarter this year. So I believe that's going to be more normalized as we get into 2025. I would say there's a slight difference, however, between casualty and professional liability as well. You can just observe that in the pricing environment. So overall casualty is a much larger sector. There's a lot of different risks. It's hard to just put a singular label on casualty in those classes. But it's a constructive rating environment, and pricing environment right now. Professional liability, if you take something, it's a smaller sort of segment overall and if you take something like Public D&O, it's pretty well reported some of the concerns about the pricing environment there. So I think we could continue to see some pressure in that space depending on market conditions.\nAndrew Andersen: Thanks. And maybe switching gears here a little bit, I think Nephila is reported on a year lag, but presumably you're getting real-time indications as to how the current year is shaping up. Just given that there's been some noise and some losses within ILS over the last few years, could you frame the upside potential for segment income for Nephila in '25, I think it was about $20 million-ish of income in '23. So could that double in a clean year for '25 income?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, a couple of things here. So we do not report to fill on a year lag, let alone any lag at all. So we just to sort of clarify that. So what we're experiencing right now, is their sort of current earnings. Now you may be thinking about how depending on in the portfolios where they may earn performance or management fees, there could be adjustments at the end of the year into the New Year, if that happens. But that's a small part of the overall earnings profile for Nephila. What I would say is I think the, we see increased earnings coming through the platform this year, compared to a year ago. And were it not for kind of the elevated climate signal and some of the hedging strategy, deploying less capital, writing less premium, we would have seen higher levels of revenue and higher levels of earnings. So, we'll kind of see what '25 brings as far as our indication of the climate, and with regards to what the pricing environment is. But all sides would point to it should be a pretty constructive environment for, for us relative Nephila in '25.\nAndrew Andersen: Thanks. And maybe if I just try to clarify that a little bit. So the management fee portion would be real-time, but the performance fee would be on a lag. Is that a good way to think about it?\nTom Gayner: Yes, it's not so much that it's on a lag, it's generally speaking the performance fee would be earned at the stroke of midnight. So it would typically be something that would be a binary outcome recognized in the fourth quarter results based on a full year's performance. But again that's a small component of the overall earnings potential between what we would earn on management fees, and where we have products that are actually feed more based on gross written premium. And that's part of what we talk about in the other fronting space.\nAndrew Andersen: Thanks for the answers.\nTom Gayner: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Good morning. I just want to follow-up on the Nephila question. Sorry, I got a frog in my throat. I thought the performance fees could actually be quite significant - under favorable catastrophe conditions. And if I'm right, or maybe you could just give a little color in general on how Nephila's performance was in the third quarter, just given all the activity with lean and as you look into the early part of the fourth quarter with Milton. How has Nephila's performance been, and is there potential for material upside in performance fees?\nTom Gayner: Yes, sure, Andrew, sure. I'll give you a couple thoughts. I'm not going to give you kind of complete guidance there. So with regards to the potential around earning performance fees, it really depends on the investor and their selection and the structure. So it's not like every fund in every offering in every structure, has that potential. And in fact what we've seen, is that much of the new products that we're deploying, are feed based on gross written premium. And that's part of where we see the results coming through in the other front end space. And those may have be more driven off the actual fee income recognized, and profits and earnings recognized in the year versus performance fees. As far as how are the funds performance this year holding up? Doing actually quite well despite the elevated level of activity. And that really I think highlights one, the quality of the portfolio construction the Nephila team took, and how we manage sort of those portfolios for those returns. And obviously the constructiveness of the pricing environment, relative to the deals that we wrote and supported. So I'm not going to give any specifics on the fund performance, but the funds are performing well. There will be the possibility, absent any further events, of recognizing a modest amount of performance fees that will be less, because it was not a clean year that it would have been had it been a clean year. And also obviously, because of some of the hedging strategies we deployed given the elevated climate signal.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it, very helpful. And then with regard to reinsurance, so that was kind of a tricky loss ratio at close to 79, you had a real drop off, 3% adverse impact on the premium adjustments, losses on credit insurance, higher picks on professional and GL. So I guess as I think about reinsurance, does it feel like, you've kind of righted the ship and next year you could kind of get back to more normalized levels, maybe in the mid-60s on the loss ratio?\nTom Gayner: Andrew good, good question. You're exactly right. There's a lot of noise within the reinsurance segment, particularly in the quarter. And I would first just acknowledge that our reinsurance results are falling well short of our goals. One thing I would highlight, which I kind of mentioned, is we did take additional action around our public entity book. That is true in the quarter, therefore for the year this year. It was also true in last year, in the year-to-date results. And that book of business continued to be adversely impacted by illegal system abuse, more so than what we see across our wider casualty offerings. Public entity was a modest portfolio, it wasn't poor and we exited that in the, in the period. That's created a lot of drag. That alone would bring our results into profitability for the year. And I think probably almost for the quarter as well. Additionally to your point, we've seen a little bit of pockets of specific loss activity around select deals. Some of that in our credit and surety, some of that within transactional liability, part of professional liability, and we remain really cautious around our general liability portfolio. Those - sort of act that loss activity has led to us increasing our loss picks on the current year. Really out of prudence and an abundance of caution, to ensure we're trying to stay ahead of those loss trends that may exist or be seen within our accidents portfolio. So we're taking obviously the benefit of insights that we have in our own primary book. We're reflecting some of that caution. We're increasing our initial reserving selections. We're trying to be prudent, with those best estimates. And we're also reacting immediately, when we see some loss activity versus letting IB&R absorb that on the prior year. So there's a lot of caution in the reinsurance platform. I would like to think that our expectation is there's more embedded profitability in the most recent underwriting years and those will perform better than the more seasoned years that have presented the drag on results. So that should moderate in time. I can't speak to specificity as far as when we will see that.\nAndrew Kligerman: Very helpful. Maybe I could just sneak one more in on the ventures engine, revenue up about 1%, EBITDA down about 13%. I think you noted the pressures coming from construction and one of one of the transportation related businesses. Do you think this is a new baseline for kind of EBITDA in the business? Do you think kind of the $107 million is more of a baseline? How should we think about that going forward?\nTom Gayner: Yes, this is Tom. I'm going to pause for just a second here because maybe some of you on this conference call know this and know my friend Chad Rowe who died last week after fighting a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Chad was a great friend. He was a great mentor. He was a great teacher to me. And any of you that knew him know that I'm telling you the truth about that. And Chad dispensed his advice and his counsel in a wry and humorous way and always had a smile on his face. And you ended up with a smile on your face too after you talk to him. And one of the things Chad said on a regular basis was in the investment business, and I'll extend that to ventures and operating businesses. You look either smarter or dumber than you really are at any given point in time. So to look at any one quarter of Markel Ventures and think you're looking at a normal EBITDA margin and profitability base, given the cyclicality of those businesses and the array of those businesses, it's just silly and it serves no purpose whatsoever. Now, what does serve a purpose, and that's where I tried to go at the beginning of the comments, is look over the five year averages. Those are real, those are durable. They're dependable. They're a long enough timeframe to get some sense of what you're really looking at. So I would encourage you to heed the advice of my dear friend Chad and try to find out how smart or stupid we really are. And look at those five-year averages, and look at five-year averages, over five-year averages and trend there. That's where I think you get a good picture. I know that's not helpful with your quarterly models, but that's really how we run the business.\nAndrew Kligerman: No, and I'm really sorry to hear that you passed. But maybe just more or how confident, Tom, are you in the construction business seeing improvement in that one transportation related business? I mean, is this sort of a one kind of a trophy feel that you have about those businesses? Or do you think that maybe there could be some pickup moving forward that this is just kind of a point in time that's kind of a trophy point?\nTom Gayner: Yes, I really just don't think of it in those terms. And I look at those businesses and I look at their long term financial performance, I look at the capital that we have in them, I look at the returns on capital they've produced over time and they're great. And if you ask me if I could do them again, if I could buy another set of businesses like that at the kind of prices we would pay, I would do that in the New York minute. So they're good businesses. And the normal volatility that goes along with cyclicality, especially when you're comparing it to a white hot period a year ago, it just doesn't even register with.\nAndrew Kligerman: That's helpful. Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. Please go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Yes, thank you. One thing caught my eye in the MD&A was that the current year loss ratio benefited from higher ceded loss recovery assumptions on glass. I'm just sort of curious, could you go into that a little bit if possible, and is that something that would persist for multiple quarters. And then I'll throw on also, does that imply anything in terms of your casualty reinsurance program or pricing on that program? Just a little bit there would be helpful.\nJeremy Noble: Thank you. Yes, Mark, it's Jeremy. So, we've talked about for several quarters in a row on our most recent accident years that we've been increasing our attritional loss ratios. And that's true for the, for the current year as well. And we've been recognizing or embedding a larger margin of safety because of some of that uncertainty. Part of what we did in the quarter was actually to refine some of our estimates around the reinsurance recoverable to kind of calibrate, if you will, to what we were doing on the gross reserving side. So that had the effect of reflecting in a world in which our recorded reserves are showing that additional margin of safety that may imply a bit more recovery. And we wanted to refine that estimate to sort of bring some of those selections in line. So a little bit more of an impact, if you will, on the quarterly results that's a little bit more smooth on the year to-date. And again, that's very different than what would be implied at a best estimate level.\nMark Hughes: Okay. So maybe not something that reoccurs in the fourth quarter or at a more reduced level. Is that fair?\nJeremy Noble: What I would really say as far as fourth quarter or beyond is what you've been hearing us speak to is reshaping the portfolio, taking correcting actions, working on the underwriting, taking advantage of maybe a more favorable environment, all of good old fashioned underwriting. Those are the sorts of things that hopefully will inure to our benefit and earn through those casualty results over time.\nMark Hughes: Yes. And then as you see at the casualty reinsurance market, your use of that reinsurance. Any comments on pricing or maybe just pricing or your -- maybe being more active on reinsurance or buying more reinsurance?\nTom Gayner: Yes, I won't be -- we're in the middle of sort of the reinsurance purchasing window and there probably be more than I would say in a quarter's time. As far as generally speaking, pricing from a casualty reinsurance standpoint, we're obviously, we have a large insurance operation and we see and understand and appreciate some of the rate that's coming through there and we have a -- we're both a buyer and a seller of reinsurance. So, pricing I think is going up in the casualty space. So I imagine that may be reflected. That being said, I think we have long standing relationships. We're a high quality underwriting shop. I think we've taken a very intellectually honest and data driven approach to managing our portfolios. And I think when we spend time with our reinsurers, they recognize and acknowledge the work and the actions we're taking.\nMark Hughes: Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC. Please go ahead.\nScott Heleniak: Yes, thanks. Thanks. Good morning. First question was just on reserves. So you had over 100 million in reserve releases in the quarter and sounds like you're feeling kind of pretty good about where they are right now. But wonder if you can comment just any more on the accident years. Is there any accident years in particular? We saw most of that benefit. And is that mostly just severity driven versus your expectations, the benefits there?\nTom Gayner: Yes, Scott, I made some of these comments in my prepared remarks. There's a handful of different things that are happening there. We continue to see pretty good loss experience within our international portfolios and whether or not it's good things getting better or bad things getting worse, right? There's a trend over time. And so what we've observed in the international books, and I'll take our international professional lines as a good example, is we've had a very constructive environment in recent years. Loss activity has been fairly modest. We've been improving some of the selections on older years and as that holds up over longer periods of time that gives us more confidence with regards to how the more recent years will perform. So that would be an example where we've seen decent prior year favorable takedowns on more recent accident years, but it results from looking at things over a long period of time and seeing how that performance has played out. We have other examples which I mentioned really where we see in the U.S. book, modest amounts of favorable improvement relative to experience, across a wide range of products and programs. Some of that is also on more recent years, because as we mentioned, building in a margin of safety, things sort of perform and behave well over time. We'll sort of reattribute some of that margin safety to more recent years, and we might take some of that benefit in somewhat recent accident years. So a handful of things that are happening within the prior year development space.\nScott Heleniak: Great.\nTom Gayner: I think we're getting to a more normalized level, right. As I sort of made in my comments. And you could observe if you looked at Markel's performance over the last 20 years, you should have reasonable expectation that if absent adverse claims trends that are unexpected, we should see reasonable levels of prior year redundancies.\nScott Heleniak: Great, great, appreciate the detail. And then just wanted to ask too, I mean we've been seeing and hearing about the increased competition in property and deseller and pricing in the last couple of months and quarters. Just wondering where Markel is in property right now. Are you seeing growth in that, and just what's the overall view in the trends, and how you're looking at that given you know what's happening now and what you think might happen in 2025 there in property?\nTom Gayner: Yes, well we're kind of live into it Scott, as far as sort of seeing maybe how the property pricing environment will evolve, it's probably a little bit early to say how that will, that will play out. I'll know a lot more by the time we're back together in a quarter's time. Based on some of the recent event activity and performance overall. As far as kind of growth in that product line, I would say - we're kind of close to flat this year within. And what we would have spoken to, is in the early part of the year we were seeing still rate increases. And then as we approach the middle part of the year, and through this quarter that began to moderate and there's been modest price declines. So for the most part our premiums, our exposure is kind of largely staying the same, and the premiums are kind of reflecting what's happening on the rates side. So there's not a lot in the property story if you will, quarter-over-quarter and for the year we're kind of close to, close to flat. We'll wait and see. I mean we still, our property portfolios are performing well, I think I mentioned earlier they're accretive to our overall profitability. We would view the property in the portfolios that we're writing certainly to be attractive, rate adequate. And we'll see and observe market trends to determine whether, or not we see the opportunity to hold the line or grow, or reshape.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's helpful. And the last one, just a numbers question. The non-controlling interest impact, it was look was up about $20 million or so versus the past few quarters. Was there anything that drove that - was there anything kind of one-time, or any adjustment on that - that's worth calling out?\nBrian Costanzo: Yes, Scott, this is Brian. So the piece that goes through there that we've had a couple of times, it was a little more pronounced this quarter, as you noted, is there are loss takedowns relative to our consolidation of Markel CATCo. So that runs through the operating income side, and then it goes back out through non-controlling interest, because really all those loss takedowns belong to those investments. There are some other small things that happen in there, relative to kind of the non-controlling interest that we own in the ventures companies. But that's the biggest kind of single delta period-over-period.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. So that's just a volatile thing that happens from time-to-time, I guess you can't predict it, so?\nBrian Costanzo: Correct. I mean, and we're in the process of winding down that CATCo side. So I think you will start seeing that diminish over time, and eventually that will not be in the financials once the entire platform is wound down.\nScott Heleniak: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Tom Liedtke with Citadel]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This question is for Tom. Under some adverse conditions, let's say our underwriting is not profitable and equity markets are way down. You guys have done a lot to improve the conservative nature of our balance sheet over the last five years. And I applaud all that and enjoy the share repurchase absent a better opportunity. But given a really dark scenario, is there any way that the share repurchase program, would be stopped if the conditions were pretty bleak? Or do you foresee that the current, what I would consider modest repurchase would be able to be continued through even the worst of conditions?\nTom Gayner: Yes Tom, nice to hear from you. The thought and the design is to be able to steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, continue to do repurchasing under almost any scenario that we can kind of imagine. So it's always a balancing act. You're choosing between different alternatives, how much dry powder you want to keep, what the prices of potential deals are, what the price of Markel shares are. But you and I have talked over the years, and have had many examples of where you've seen companies buying stock, buying stock, buying stock and make a big hoo-ha about it. And then when times get tough, they stop. Our actions are designed to not have that happen to the best of our ability. And you see that we've been kind of increasing the pace of share repurchases recently. So I hear what you're saying, and I would take comfort in that bid.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. And I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Andersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Andersen: Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Just 30 days into the last quarter of the year, are there any additional reserve studies that you plan to conduct in 4Q outside of the normal quarterly studies that you've been doing through nine months?\nJeremy Noble: And it's Jeremy, we look at really all of our reserves each and every quarter. There are always times where we're doing some review of subclasses or lines. There's nothing that I would call out specifically.\nAndrew Andersen: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Well, thank you all for joining us. I hope you will update your models for the five-year forecast rather than perhaps the next quarter. And with that, that about wraps up. We'll see you next quarter. Have a great evening everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, presenters. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, Perilla, and good morning. Thank you all for joining us. This is Tom Gayner, the CEO. I'm joined today by Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance Operations; and Brian Costanzo, our CFO. As always, we welcome the chance to share our latest financial updates and we look forward to your questions. I'll jump right in with the headlines. The Markel Group continues to move forward at a good clip. For the purposes of a thought exercise, I'd invite you to think of us as an aircraft. In any plane there are several gauges and monitors to measure the conditions of the plane. The same is true for the Markel Group. I'd like to share with you some of the key gauge readings I monitor and why I contend that this plane is moving forward at a pretty good clip. I can't imagine a plane without at least four absolutely mission critical gauges. On a complex plane like Markel Group, there are more but these four cannot be replaced. In my layman's mind and I don't know the first thing about being a pilot. The mission critical gauges measure speed, fuel, altitude and direction. Without speed, no aircraft can fly. Airplanes need to travel at a certain rate of speed to achieve a lift and remain airborne. Without fuel, the energy needed to power the engines to achieve speed won't work. As a pilot, I'm pretty sure you need to know how much fuel you have and whether it is enough to get you to your destination. Without altitude and awareness of the terrain, the plane might bump into something and that will not end well. Without knowing direction, everything might be working, but you may be headed to the wrong place. I'll offer the following analogy for those four gauges and measurements from our Markel Group. I'll also speak to them in the five year measurement terms that we monitor to determine whether our craft is functioning as it should. First, as of September 30, 2024, total net investments, that is our entire publicly traded investment portfolio plus cash minus debt, summed up to $30.3 billion. Five years ago, on September 30, 2019, that number stood at $18 billion. That's an increase of 68%. Second, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned underwriting and insurance operating income of $458 million compared to $249 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 84%. Third, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned $388 million of operating income and our Markel Ventures operations compared to $179 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 117%. Fourth, through the first nine months of 2024, we earned recurring dividend and interest income of $677 million compared to $339 million in the first nine months of 2019. That's an increase of 99%. At September 30, 2024, each share of Markel Group sold for about $1,570. At September 30, 2019, each year Markel Group sold for $1,180. That's an increase of 33%. That is the smallest percentage increase of any of those numbers. I would suggest that the gauges measuring our total net investments, our underwriting and insurance earnings, our Markel Ventures earnings, and our recurring investment earnings would be the measurements that I, as your pilot and you as fellow shareholders should be monitoring. Those gauge readings are not perfect and in some cases they show that we fell short of what we strive for and what we expect going forward. Nonetheless, I think it's fair to assert that they describe an airworthy craft. In response to those measurements, which I believe describe genuine progress and our sense of intrinsic value, we've responded by repurchasing Markel Group shares. Five years ago, our share count stood at 13.815 million shares. At September 30, 2024, it stood at 12.887. Most of the repurchase activity took place starting in 2022 and it continues through this day. So far that's a decrease of about 6.7% in outstanding shares. We think given our valuation, capital position and capital allocation alternatives, that repurchasing shares makes sense, and as such we are doing so. In just a minute, Brian and Jeremy will descend from the five year measurement timeframe to the first nine months of 2024 and provide some relevant details and comments on our overall financial position and our insurance business. I will add in the spirit of shifting to annual comparisons that in our Markel Ventures operations we faced a tough comparison against the same period a year ago. Last year I spoke about conditions in some of our more cyclical businesses as white hot. At this point I would describe conditions as beige hot. That makes for tough year-over-year comparisons, but I remain very happy with the ongoing performance of the Markel Ventures collection of businesses. In our investment operations, we continue to benefit from persistent production of cash from our insurance and ventures operations as well as increased dividend and interest income and capital appreciation. In our insurance operations, we work to respond to the catastrophes and events to help clients in their times of need. We also work to continue to improve our financial performance while building the capital it takes to help our customers when they need it most. The sum of these positive flows combined give us the fuel to keep investing in publicly traded securities, fund acquisitions, fund growth opportunities and repurchase stock, and we keep seeming to have more money in the kitty. To me, that seems like a healthy set of gauge readings. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to lower the plane from the discussion about the cruising altitude of 39,000 feet towards ground level as we approach the runway of current year-to-date financial results. Following Brian, Jeremy will pick up some comments about our insurance operations and then we will open the floor for questions. Brian? Thank you, Jeremy. And with that, Perilla, we'd love to open the floor for your questions. Yes, it's not so much that it's on a lag, it's generally speaking the performance fee would be earned at the stroke of midnight. So it would typically be something that would be a binary outcome recognized in the fourth quarter results based on a full year's performance. But again that's a small component of the overall earnings potential between what we would earn on management fees, and where we have products that are actually feed more based on gross written premium. And that's part of what we talk about in the other fronting space. Yes. Yes, sure, Andrew, sure. I'll give you a couple thoughts. I'm not going to give you kind of complete guidance there. So with regards to the potential around earning performance fees, it really depends on the investor and their selection and the structure. So it's not like every fund in every offering in every structure, has that potential. And in fact what we've seen, is that much of the new products that we're deploying, are feed based on gross written premium. And that's part of where we see the results coming through in the other front end space. And those may have be more driven off the actual fee income recognized, and profits and earnings recognized in the year versus performance fees. As far as how are the funds performance this year holding up? Doing actually quite well despite the elevated level of activity. And that really I think highlights one, the quality of the portfolio construction the Nephila team took, and how we manage sort of those portfolios for those returns. And obviously the constructiveness of the pricing environment, relative to the deals that we wrote and supported. So I'm not going to give any specifics on the fund performance, but the funds are performing well. There will be the possibility, absent any further events, of recognizing a modest amount of performance fees that will be less, because it was not a clean year that it would have been had it been a clean year. And also obviously, because of some of the hedging strategies we deployed given the elevated climate signal. Andrew good, good question. You're exactly right. There's a lot of noise within the reinsurance segment, particularly in the quarter. And I would first just acknowledge that our reinsurance results are falling well short of our goals. One thing I would highlight, which I kind of mentioned, is we did take additional action around our public entity book. That is true in the quarter, therefore for the year this year. It was also true in last year, in the year-to-date results. And that book of business continued to be adversely impacted by illegal system abuse, more so than what we see across our wider casualty offerings. Public entity was a modest portfolio, it wasn't poor and we exited that in the, in the period. That's created a lot of drag. That alone would bring our results into profitability for the year. And I think probably almost for the quarter as well. Additionally to your point, we've seen a little bit of pockets of specific loss activity around select deals. Some of that in our credit and surety, some of that within transactional liability, part of professional liability, and we remain really cautious around our general liability portfolio. Those - sort of act that loss activity has led to us increasing our loss picks on the current year. Really out of prudence and an abundance of caution, to ensure we're trying to stay ahead of those loss trends that may exist or be seen within our accidents portfolio. So we're taking obviously the benefit of insights that we have in our own primary book. We're reflecting some of that caution. We're increasing our initial reserving selections. We're trying to be prudent, with those best estimates. And we're also reacting immediately, when we see some loss activity versus letting IB&R absorb that on the prior year. So there's a lot of caution in the reinsurance platform. I would like to think that our expectation is there's more embedded profitability in the most recent underwriting years and those will perform better than the more seasoned years that have presented the drag on results. So that should moderate in time. I can't speak to specificity as far as when we will see that. Yes, this is Tom. I'm going to pause for just a second here because maybe some of you on this conference call know this and know my friend Chad Rowe who died last week after fighting a long battle with Parkinson's disease. Chad was a great friend. He was a great mentor. He was a great teacher to me. And any of you that knew him know that I'm telling you the truth about that. And Chad dispensed his advice and his counsel in a wry and humorous way and always had a smile on his face. And you ended up with a smile on your face too after you talk to him. And one of the things Chad said on a regular basis was in the investment business, and I'll extend that to ventures and operating businesses. You look either smarter or dumber than you really are at any given point in time. So to look at any one quarter of Markel Ventures and think you're looking at a normal EBITDA margin and profitability base, given the cyclicality of those businesses and the array of those businesses, it's just silly and it serves no purpose whatsoever. Now, what does serve a purpose, and that's where I tried to go at the beginning of the comments, is look over the five year averages. Those are real, those are durable. They're dependable. They're a long enough timeframe to get some sense of what you're really looking at. So I would encourage you to heed the advice of my dear friend Chad and try to find out how smart or stupid we really are. And look at those five-year averages, and look at five-year averages, over five-year averages and trend there. That's where I think you get a good picture. I know that's not helpful with your quarterly models, but that's really how we run the business. Yes, I really just don't think of it in those terms. And I look at those businesses and I look at their long term financial performance, I look at the capital that we have in them, I look at the returns on capital they've produced over time and they're great. And if you ask me if I could do them again, if I could buy another set of businesses like that at the kind of prices we would pay, I would do that in the New York minute. So they're good businesses. And the normal volatility that goes along with cyclicality, especially when you're comparing it to a white hot period a year ago, it just doesn't even register with. Yes, I won't be -- we're in the middle of sort of the reinsurance purchasing window and there probably be more than I would say in a quarter's time. As far as generally speaking, pricing from a casualty reinsurance standpoint, we're obviously, we have a large insurance operation and we see and understand and appreciate some of the rate that's coming through there and we have a -- we're both a buyer and a seller of reinsurance. So, pricing I think is going up in the casualty space. So I imagine that may be reflected. That being said, I think we have long standing relationships. We're a high quality underwriting shop. I think we've taken a very intellectually honest and data driven approach to managing our portfolios. And I think when we spend time with our reinsurers, they recognize and acknowledge the work and the actions we're taking. Yes, Scott, I made some of these comments in my prepared remarks. There's a handful of different things that are happening there. We continue to see pretty good loss experience within our international portfolios and whether or not it's good things getting better or bad things getting worse, right? There's a trend over time. And so what we've observed in the international books, and I'll take our international professional lines as a good example, is we've had a very constructive environment in recent years. Loss activity has been fairly modest. We've been improving some of the selections on older years and as that holds up over longer periods of time that gives us more confidence with regards to how the more recent years will perform. So that would be an example where we've seen decent prior year favorable takedowns on more recent accident years, but it results from looking at things over a long period of time and seeing how that performance has played out. We have other examples which I mentioned really where we see in the U.S. book, modest amounts of favorable improvement relative to experience, across a wide range of products and programs. Some of that is also on more recent years, because as we mentioned, building in a margin of safety, things sort of perform and behave well over time. We'll sort of reattribute some of that margin safety to more recent years, and we might take some of that benefit in somewhat recent accident years. So a handful of things that are happening within the prior year development space. I think we're getting to a more normalized level, right. As I sort of made in my comments. And you could observe if you looked at Markel's performance over the last 20 years, you should have reasonable expectation that if absent adverse claims trends that are unexpected, we should see reasonable levels of prior year redundancies. Yes, well we're kind of live into it Scott, as far as sort of seeing maybe how the property pricing environment will evolve, it's probably a little bit early to say how that will, that will play out. I'll know a lot more by the time we're back together in a quarter's time. Based on some of the recent event activity and performance overall. As far as kind of growth in that product line, I would say - we're kind of close to flat this year within. And what we would have spoken to, is in the early part of the year we were seeing still rate increases. And then as we approach the middle part of the year, and through this quarter that began to moderate and there's been modest price declines. So for the most part our premiums, our exposure is kind of largely staying the same, and the premiums are kind of reflecting what's happening on the rates side. So there's not a lot in the property story if you will, quarter-over-quarter and for the year we're kind of close to, close to flat. We'll wait and see. I mean we still, our property portfolios are performing well, I think I mentioned earlier they're accretive to our overall profitability. We would view the property in the portfolios that we're writing certainly to be attractive, rate adequate. And we'll see and observe market trends to determine whether, or not we see the opportunity to hold the line or grow, or reshape. Yes Tom, nice to hear from you. The thought and the design is to be able to steady, steady, steady, steady, steady, continue to do repurchasing under almost any scenario that we can kind of imagine. So it's always a balancing act.

            "name": "Brian Costanzo",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Through the first nine months of this year we saw terrific returns on our equity portfolio, adding $1.7 billion to operating income, which is the headline change in almost any consolidated metric. However, it's also important to note the aggregate growth in operating income from our underlying businesses, insurance and ventures, along with our recurring interest and dividends, which grew by double digits in both the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods. With that, let's go through the results, starting off with our consolidated results. Total revenues increased 15% to $12.8 billion for the first nine months of 2024, and total operating income increased significantly year-over-year to $3.1 billion, with the largest driver being the market value movements on our equity portfolio. Net income to common shareholders was $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in the same period of 2023. Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first nine months of 2024 was $2.5 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in the same period of 2033. Net cash from operating activities was $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $2 billion in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines, with the most significant contribution coming from insurance. In the first nine months of 2024, we repurchased $389 million of Markel Group common stock under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $270 million in the same period last year. Now I'll move to the performance of each of our three operating engines, starting off with our insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew by 4% to $8.2 billion for the first nine months of 2024 compared to $7.9 billion in the same period last year. Our premium growth was driven by select U.S. lines of business, most notably our personal lines, and our international marine and energy insurance and reinsurance products. This was partially offset by targeted premium contraction in select classes within our U.S. professional liability and general liability portfolios, where we took underwriting actions to improve profitability. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first nine months of both 2024 and 2023 was 95%. Both periods included one point of catastrophe losses. Our 2024 combined ratio included $62 million of net losses attributed to Hurricane Helene, while our 2023 combined ratio included $46 million of net losses attributed to the Hawaiian Wildfires and Hurricane Idalia. In addition, we disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q as a subsequent event, our preliminary estimated range for Hurricane Milton of between $40 million and $80 million in losses that will be recorded in the fourth quarter. These losses from catastrophe events are within our expectations for events of this size. In 2024, the combined ratio benefited from more favorable development on prior accident year loss reserves compared to 2023, the impact of which was mostly offset by higher attritional losses including those on our intellectual property Collateral Protection Insurance or CPI product line. Our year-to-date 2024 consolidated combined ratio included $139 million or 2 points of losses from CPI, while our year-to-date 2023 consolidated combined ratio included $68 million or 1 point of losses from CPI. Prior year loss reserves development improved over the first nine months of 2024 to $344 million in loss takedowns versus $170 million in 2023. Favorable development in the first nine months of 2024 was most notable within our international professional liability product lines. We remain cautious in our approach to both reducing prior year loss reserves and in our current accident year attritional loss ratio on our longer tail U.S. professional liability and general liability product lines given recent claims trends. Within our program services and ILS operations, operating income totaled $101 million, primarily driven by strong growth and performance from our fronting operations both at State National and in support of Nephila. Turning next to our investment results. Net investment income for the first nine months of 2024 was $677 million compared to $520 million in the same period last year. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates compared to the first nine months of 2023. We expect based on the current interest rate environment that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher yielding securities. Net investment gains of $1.7 billion in 2024 reflect favorable market value movements resulting in an 18.5% return on our public equity portfolio in the first nine months of 2024. This compares to net investment gains of $591 million in the first nine months of 2023. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets from period-to-period. At the end of September, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pre-tax unrealized gains of $7.8 billion. Net unrealized investment gains included in other comprehensive income in the first nine months of 2024 were $283 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment losses of $135 million net of taxes last year. At the end of September, the cumulative pre-tax unrealized loss on our fixed maturity portfolio was $198 million. We typically hold our fixed maturity investments until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. We continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of September 30, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, I'll cover the results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 3% in the first nine months of 2024 versus the same period of 2023 driven by our consumer and building products businesses as well as the contribution from our June 2024 acquisition of Valor. Marco Ventures operating income decreased 1% due to the impact of lower revenues and operating margins at our construction services and transportation related businesses. This was largely offset by the impact of higher revenues and margins at our consumer and building products businesses. While our growth metrics are down slightly, many of our Markel Ventures companies are performing very well, but as Tom mentioned earlier, certain of our businesses, in particular our transportation businesses, are benchmarked against peak performance metrics from a year ago. With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine. Yes, Scott, this is Brian. So the piece that goes through there that we've had a couple of times, it was a little more pronounced this quarter, as you noted, is there are loss takedowns relative to our consolidation of Markel CATCo. So that runs through the operating income side, and then it goes back out through non-controlling interest, because really all those loss takedowns belong to those investments. There are some other small things that happen in there, relative to kind of the non-controlling interest that we own in the ventures companies. But that's the biggest kind of single delta period-over-period. Correct. I mean, and we're in the process of winding down that CATCo side. So I think you will start seeing that diminish over time, and eventually that will not be in the financials once the entire platform is wound down."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. Our work to build a more consistent top financial performer within our insurance operations continues to progress. Our underlying results within our U.S. insurance operations are steadily improving while our international operations continue to perform exceptionally well. While our third quarter combined ratio of 96 is not what we aspire to, this quarter's results were impacted by 3 points of losses related to Hurricane Helene and 2 points of losses on our intellectual Property Collateral Protection portfolio which is in runoff. For the year, our combined ratio sits at a 95 and includes 1 point of cat losses and 2 points of losses related to our CPI product. Regarding the ongoing effects of winding down our in force CPI portfolio, nothing has meaningfully changed from my comments a quarter ago, we continue to expect the majority of the loss activity to be resolved by the end of 2025. Throughout 2024, the insurance industry has seen elevated losses arising from natural catastrophe events beyond Hurricane Helene. While we are exposed to losses on these types of events, our incurred losses have been attritional in nature. Given the portfolio management actions we've made in recent years and our catastrophe exposed products remain profitable and contribute positively to our overall results. Our estimated Hurricane Milton losses which will be recognized in the fourth quarter do not change that position. Our overall risk bearing premium production continues to be affected by the underwriting actions we have been taking since late 2023. Within our insurance segment on select U.S. casualty and risk managed professional liability lines where the corrective underwriting actions have been most focused, premiums are down by over 20%. The remainder of our products where we are generally achieving our profitability targets are up 8%. We continue to see growth in many of our international lines, including within our marine and energy and trade credit products and across our international casualty, Europe and Asia portfolios where we have made investments in talent and expanded our product capabilities into additional markets. Within our domestic portfolio, our personal lines, inland marine, managed reliability and programs offerings, among others, continue to produce strong profitable growth. As we prepare to move into 2025, we plan to further grow in areas where we see opportunities for our specialist solutions. As Brian mentioned, our combined ratio for the year has benefited from a higher level of prior year reserve releases than a year ago. It's worth taking a moment to speak to this. First, our prior year loss reserves have benefited from higher reserve releases within our international portfolio. In aggregate, our international lines have behaved quite well with actual versus expected claim experience coming in favorably over the course of several quarters. These favorable trends have resulted in a reduction to reserves and lower ultimate loss ratios in line with claims experience while we continue to maintain a margin of safety in our reserves. Second, in the U.S., while we have some products where actual versus expected loss trends are behaving quite well, such as workers compensation, a significant portion of our reserve releases are a function of the overall reserving philosophy. As we have said before, we consistently reserve at a level to be more likely redundant than deficient. Each year we prudently layer on a margin of safety above our best estimate loss ratios within each product to acknowledge that uncertainty exists with loss development trends. Over time, if losses behave as expected, we will experience reserve releases, which has historically been the case. Given the elevated levels of adverse loss experience in our U.S. general liability and professional liability product lines during 2022 and 2023, we took action, including both adding reserves on older accident years given experience and increasing the margin of safety applied on more recent accident years. Overall prior development on our total reserves for U.S. casualty and professional product lines have been close to flat this year, while the rest of our insurance portfolio has performed well, which allows us to experience higher levels of reserve releases. In general, absent unexpected adverse trends in our claims development, we would expect to have meaningful reserve releases best demonstrated by our long-term track record of net reserve releases. Turning to our expense ratio, a few comments on recent trends. Our direct and controllable expense ratio in the insurance segment is elevated from prior years. We see this impact in the third quarter where the overall expense ratio eclipsed 35% in conjunction with our net earned premiums turning slightly negative. The vast majority of expenses arise from our insurance operations and there are different drivers contributing to this outcome. Within our international division we continue to see excellent performance and we have been investing in underwriting talent and systems to support further growth and expansion into new products and geographies. These investments are putting short-term pressure on our direct and controllable expense ratio. The strong results this year have also yielded higher profit-sharing expense commensurate with performance. So while the expense ratio is ticking up, so is overall profitability and the opportunities for future profitable growth. We feel good about our longer-term prospects here. Within our specialty operations we have seen compression in the earned premiums driven by our corrective underwriting actions and changes in our professional liability outwards reinsurance structure. These top line impacts have put pressure on our expense base that remains subject to inflationary trends from higher salaries and professional fees and is impacted by targeted investments in technology that we are making. Our earned premium growth had continued similar to previous years, we would be producing a more consistent expense ratio. Our elevated expense ratio was anticipated but also remains an area of focus for improvement in the future. We have a high degree of confidence in our ability to successfully re underwrite our portfolio and return to more historical levels of growth which will alleviate pressure on the expense ratio and yield even stronger results over the long-term. At this point, I've largely covered off our insurance segment results so let me take a minute to discuss our other divisions. Starting with our Global Reinsurance division. We remain singularly focused on writing profitable business deal by deal only deploying capital on deals that meet our underwriting criteria and profitability targets. We recently announced the exit of our public entity product line which has been a significant drag on results the past few years due to ongoing legal system abuse trends prevalent within the casualty market. If you exclude the impact from our public entity line, our reinsurance segment result for the year, our overall result for the segment would be modestly profitable. Our state national program services operations achieved significant growth of 22% through nine months while maintaining consistent levels of high profitability. We also continue to differentiate ourselves within the funding market with our ability to facilitate and place complex and unique transactions. Our team has demonstrated its ability to innovate find new ways to create value around our core competencies. Within our Nephila operations, our portfolios have performed well despite elevated levels of natural catastrophe activity. As I mentioned earlier this year, given the elevated climate signal, we deployed less capacity, partially hedged our portfolios and wrote less premium volume than we otherwise would have. These actions lowered revenues and therefore earnings this year, but were in the best long-term interest of our investors. Given current views of investment returns and the increased likelihood of an attractive pricing environment again for 2025, we feel we are well positioned heading into the new year. With that, I will turn it back over to Tom. Yes, Andrew, it's Jeremy. I'm not going to give too much guidance on that, but I will say you're exactly correct. We started obviously recognizing loss reserve development in '22 and '23, and we began taking really more impactful corrective underwriting actions, as we entered the first quarter this year. So I believe that's going to be more normalized as we get into 2025. I would say there's a slight difference, however, between casualty and professional liability as well. You can just observe that in the pricing environment. So overall casualty is a much larger sector. There's a lot of different risks. It's hard to just put a singular label on casualty in those classes. But it's a constructive rating environment, and pricing environment right now. Professional liability, if you take something, it's a smaller sort of segment overall and if you take something like Public D&O, it's pretty well reported some of the concerns about the pricing environment there. So I think we could continue to see some pressure in that space depending on market conditions. Yes, a couple of things here. So we do not report to fill on a year lag, let alone any lag at all. So we just to sort of clarify that. So what we're experiencing right now, is their sort of current earnings. Now you may be thinking about how depending on in the portfolios where they may earn performance or management fees, there could be adjustments at the end of the year into the New Year, if that happens. But that's a small part of the overall earnings profile for Nephila. What I would say is I think the, we see increased earnings coming through the platform this year, compared to a year ago. And were it not for kind of the elevated climate signal and some of the hedging strategy, deploying less capital, writing less premium, we would have seen higher levels of revenue and higher levels of earnings. So, we'll kind of see what '25 brings as far as our indication of the climate, and with regards to what the pricing environment is. But all sides would point to it should be a pretty constructive environment for, for us relative Nephila in '25. Thank you. Yes, Mark, it's Jeremy. So, we've talked about for several quarters in a row on our most recent accident years that we've been increasing our attritional loss ratios. And that's true for the, for the current year as well. And we've been recognizing or embedding a larger margin of safety because of some of that uncertainty. Part of what we did in the quarter was actually to refine some of our estimates around the reinsurance recoverable to kind of calibrate, if you will, to what we were doing on the gross reserving side. So that had the effect of reflecting in a world in which our recorded reserves are showing that additional margin of safety that may imply a bit more recovery. And we wanted to refine that estimate to sort of bring some of those selections in line. So a little bit more of an impact, if you will, on the quarterly results that's a little bit more smooth on the year to-date. And again, that's very different than what would be implied at a best estimate level. What I would really say as far as fourth quarter or beyond is what you've been hearing us speak to is reshaping the portfolio, taking correcting actions, working on the underwriting, taking advantage of maybe a more favorable environment, all of good old fashioned underwriting. Those are the sorts of things that hopefully will inure to our benefit and earn through those casualty results over time. And it's Jeremy, we look at really all of our reserves each and every quarter. There are always times where we're doing some review of subclasses or lines. There's nothing that I would call out specifically."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Gayner, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Markel Group second quarter conference call. My name is Tom Gayner, and I serve as your CEO. I'm joined today by our CFO, Brian Costanzo; and the President of our Insurance Operations, Jeremy Noble. I'll make a few opening remarks and then turn things over to Brian and Jeremy to update you on our financial results and some comments on our Insurance engine. Then we will open the floor for questions. We always appreciate the chance to spend time with our partners. We cannot build the Markel Group without long-term owners who share our goals. As such, we welcome your long-term questions, thoughts and comments as fellow owners of the business. First off, we've got some good results to share with you. Brian will follow the conventions of financial reporting and share our most recent quarterly and year-to-date financial results. I will speak to some longer-term numbers. Those results will show positive contributions from each of our three engines. Our insurance engine continued to grow in the first half of 2024. Underwriting profitability improved sequentially from the first quarter. Our ongoing accounting conservatism and integrity can also be seen by ongoing favorable reserve development. We continue to produce improved underwriting results so far in 2024 despite ongoing industry-wide pressures of inflation and loss costs across almost every class of business. I am proud of our insurance teammates and their ongoing dedication to continuing improve our underwriting performance. In our Ventures operations, we set new records in sales and earnings. I think it's accurate to say that we achieved these results against a backdrop of increasingly competitive and challenging external positions. I would also describe the overall economic environment, as returning to some sense of normality after the last few years of disrupted overall conditions, supply chain challenges emerging and being dealt with, dramatic interest rate movements in both directions and other volatility creating surprises of HEP snapping speed in force. Markel Ventures continues to perform very well amidst these conditions, and I couldn't be prouder of the team's efforts and their results. One other point on Ventures is that for the last several years, we've been talking about how high transaction prices were in the buying and selling the businesses. As such, we acted with discipline and did not add any new companies to our family in 2022 or 2023. I'm pleased to report that so far in 2024, our partners at VSC and Costa Farms have acquired businesses that complement their existing offerings and footprint. We also added a new Markel Ventures company at the end of the second quarter with the purchase of a majority interest in Valor Environmental. Valor is a leading provider of erosion control, storm water management and regulatory-driven site services, and we are delighted to welcome them to the family. Valor in each of VSC and Costa transactions met our long-standing four-part tasks we use to guide us in selecting investments both public and private. Those four parts are: one, we look for businesses with good returns on capital that don't use too much debt. Second, we look for management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity; Third, we look for businesses with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, and four, we look for all of those first three lovely attributes at a fair price. As to Valor and the additions of Costa VSE, check-check-check and check. It's worth noting that beyond being an attractive buyer and home to sellers of long-term, multi-generation family businesses their owners. At certain times, we can be an attractive buyer for financial backers such as family offices and private equity firms. Until recently, we did not consummate any deals for those types of sellers. Higher interest rates and changing business conditions are starting to shake a few things loose from some different trees these days. We are productively engaged in way more conversations with way more kinds of sellers in this environment than it has been in the case in recent years. Stay tuned for more news as time goes by. I am personally excited by what we're seeing and what we're working on these days. Our ability to productively deploy capital at good rates of return and durable businesses that meet our four-part test is exciting to me. The skills and relationships required to invest capital wisely don't spring up overnight. We've been honing these skills for decades, and the opportunities to act on them are now growing. On the investment side, we continue to consistently follow our time-tested strategy. The recurring interest and dividend income continues to increase as each maturing bond in our portfolio is replaced with a higher coupon security. Similarly, dividend income from our high-quality portfolio of equities continues to increase. While our relative equity returns this year trails the S&P 500, we remain committed to our long-term disciplined approach. The last time we trailed the S&P by this magnitude was in the late 1990s when the market seemed possessed by a singular market focus. We stuck to our guns and preserved and protected our balance sheet. That turned out to be a good thing, when the market environment changed. It seems to me like we might be facing a similar phase change environment today as we did at that time. We have been and will remain committed to our successful time-tested low-cost and tax-efficient strategy. Finally, before I turn the call over to Brian to review the 2024 results, I want to provide some thoughts on a longer-term horizon measurement of our progress at the Markel Group. As we've stated repeatedly over the years, we aspire to build one of the world's great companies, and we mean to do so in an enduring fashion. As one tool to foster long-term behavior, internally, we measure our performance over five-year intervals to judge our performance and calculate incentive compensation. We do so in an effort to constantly remain focused on longer-term accomplishments rather than quarterly or annual measures. Five years ago, at June 30, 2019, we had total net investments, that is our entire investment portfolio plus cash minus debt of $17.5 billion. As of June 30, 2024, that number stands at $28.2 billion, an increase of 61%. Five years ago through June 30, 2019, we earned underwriting and insurance income of $142 million. Five years later, through June 30, 2024, we earned underwriting and insurance income of $313 million, an increase of 120%. Five years ago through June 30, 2019, we earned $133 million of operating income in our Markel Ventures operations. Through June 30, 2024, we earned $281 million of operating income, an increase of 112%. At June 30, 2019, each share of Markel sold for about $1,100. At June 30, 2024, each share of Markel sold for about $1,575, an increase of about 43%. The share price change is the lowest number on the page. In response to our own calculation of the intrinsic value per share of Markel, and the array of opportunities available to us to productively deploy capital, we've repurchased Markel shares. Five years ago, the share count stood at 13.826 million shares. At June 30, 2024, it stood at 12.962 million, a decrease of almost 1 million shares. The vast majority of these repurchases took place in the 2022 through 2024 time frame. It seems to me that math indicates we're looking at the circumstance of more company divided by fewer shares. I think that this ought to produce excellent returns for our shareholders over time. Even more important than the numbers, is the way the numbers get achieved. The numbers are the outcome and the results of our culture and the efforts of people of this company. As we say in the first paragraph of our culture statement, the Markel Style, we believe in hard work and zealous pursuit of excellence while keeping a sense of humor. Our creed is honesty and fairness in all of our dealings. I am proud of the people Markel and I thank them for their ongoing efforts to build our company around such wonderful principles. With that, I'd like to turn things over to Brian. But wait, before I do, I just want to interject here, my frac and able wonderful assistance Cynthia Featherman actually deployed the tools of AI to take my comments and ask Microsoft copilot to write a poem about what I just said. This will only take a second, but I can't help, but share it with you. So you're good. We're glad to share some news with you about our quarter 2 review. We have 3 engines that fuel our Fire, Insurance, Ventures and Investments they inspire. Our Insurance engine showed its skill in underwriting despite some mills. Our ventures engine soared to new heights in sales and earnings and new buys. Our Investment engine stuck to our plan of low-cost, tax-efficient and brand. We track our progress over 5 years, we see more value and less fears. We also bought back some of our stock to show you that we value your lock. We thank you for your trust in backing, and we hope you'll join our unpacking. So with that AI augmented presentation, let me turn it over to you, Brian.\nBrian Costanzo: Thanks, Tom. It'd be hard to top that. Maybe we can make Dr. [indiscernible] out of that poem there. Excited to be here this morning to discuss our results for the first half of 2024. Each of our 3 engines, Insurance, Investments and Markel Ventures made significant contributions to our first half results. Starting off with the consolidated results. Total revenues increased 5% to $8.2 billion for the first half of 2024, and total operating income increased slightly year-over-year to $1.75 billion with the largest driver of growth being a 34% increase in our net investment income. Net income to common shareholders was $1.3 billion in the first half of 2024 compared to $1.2 in the same period of 2023. The comprehensive income to shareholders in the first half of both 2024 and 2023 was $1.2 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in the first half of 2024 compared to $1 billion in the same period of 2023. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most significant contribution coming from our Insurance engine. In May, we issued $600 million of 30-year 6% unsecured senior notes, bringing our debt-to-capital ratio to 22%. In the first half of 2024, we repurchased $260 million of Markel Group common stock under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $187 million in the same period of last year. Turning now to the performance of our 3 operating engines and starting with our Insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew by 6% to $5.7 billion for the first half of 2024 compared to $5.4 billion in the same period of 2023. Our increased premium volume was driven by our International Marine & Energy Insurance and Reinsurance business and growth on select US lines of business, including personal lines and programs. This was partially offset by targeted premium contraction in select classes within our US professional liability and general liability portfolios where we took underwriting actions to improve profitability. Jeremy will discuss these actions in more detail within his commentary. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2024 was 94% compared to 93% in the same period of 2023. The 1 point increase was due to higher attritional loss ratios on our professional liability and general liability insurance product lines, as we remain prudent in adding margin to classes with challenging loss trends. Also, we recognized losses on our discontinued intellectual property collateral protection insurance product. On year-to-date 2024 consolidated combined ratio, we included $96.8 million or 2 points of losses on our CPI product line. Prior year loss reserves development improved over the first half of 2024 to $221 million in loss takedowns versus $139 million in 2023. Favorable development in the first half of 2024 was most notable within our International Professional Liability product lines. We remain cautious in our approach to reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer-tail US Professional Liability and General Liability lines given recent claim trends. Within our Program Services and ILS operations, operating income increased 23% to $61 million primarily driven by strong growth and performance in our fronting businesses. Moving next to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $441 million in the first half of 2024 compared to $329 million in the same period last year. Net investment income reflects the recurring interest and dividends earned on our investment portfolio. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as the yield on our fixed maturity portfolio, short-term investments and cash equivalents all increased compared to the first half of 2023. We expect, based on the current interest rate environment that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. At June 30, 2024, the book yield on our fixed maturity portfolio was 3.4%, up from just over 3% at the end of last year. Net investment gains $772 million in 2024 reflect favorable market movements, resulting in a return of 8.9% on our public equity portfolio for the first six months of 2024. This compares to net investment gains of $857 million for the first half of 2023. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets from period to period. At the end of June, fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pretax unrealized gains of $6.9 billion. Net unrealized investment losses included in other comprehensive loss in the first half of 2024, or $152 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment gains of $30 net of taxes in the same period of 2023. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturity investments until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to the change in interest rates to reverse future periods as bonds mature. We continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of June 30, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, I'll cover the results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 4% in the first half of 2024 versus the same period of 2023, reflecting moderate revenue increases at many of our products businesses as well as contributions from an acquisition made by one of our businesses in the first quarter of 2024. Markel Ventures operating income increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and improved operating margins at our consumer and building products businesses. As Tom mentioned, we also completed the acquisition of Valor Environmental late in the second quarter, adding to our family of businesses within Markel Ventures. Inclusion of operating results from Valor will begin in the third quarter. For our June financials, the preliminary allocation of purchase price includes $108 million to million to goodwill and $49 intangible assets. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine.\nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you to discuss our progress within the insurance engine over the first half of this year. Our results continued to improve this year, coming off elevated combined ratio results during the latter half of 2023 due to prior year's reserve strengthening. Our combined ratio for the second quarter improved sequentially and our first half combined ratio is where we expected to be at this point in the year despite higher losses within our intellectual property collateral protection portfolio which is in runoff. As Brian shared, we experienced greater favorable development on prior year's reserves through six months of 2024 than a year ago, and have not seen meaningful further development in the products we addressed at year-end. Overall, our operating revenue growth and underwriting gross written premium growth in the first half of the year reflects the actions we have taken to improve profitability. Within our Insurance segment, the lines where I have previously discussed us taking significant underwriting action to improve profitability, namely our brokerage excess and umbrella and brokerage contractors books within general liability, and risk-managed professional liability classes, we decreased writings year-to-date by over 20%. The remainder of our products in our Insurance segment, where we are generally achieving good levels of profitability and are satisfied with rate adequacy have grown 8% in the aggregate. Now let me briefly take you through each of our divisions for the first half of the year. First off, within our Specialty Division, we continue to benefit from the corrective actions taken within select classes in our casualty and professional liability books, while will also remain cautious on current accident year loss picks in these areas. This is most evident the gross written premium reductions in select classes of our casualty and professional books. I mentioned earlier. But specifically, we continue to pursue growth profitable product classes, including personal lines, property, inland marine, binding and small commercial, managed reliability and select programs business. Many of these lines are achieving meaningful rate increases. An exception is property, where in the past few months, we have seen a contraction in rates back to low single digits but still at attractive pricing levels. The growth in these lines is improving the product mix and overall combined ratio of the division as our premium earnings mix changes. Within casualty and professional liability classes, we continue to execute on our corrective underwriting action plans within certain pockets of the portfolio, where results have not met our expectations. During the first half of the year, our recently discontinued Intellectual Property Collateral Protection product line negatively impacted our combined ratio performance due to an increase in the frequency of defaults on loans collateralized by intellectual property that became impaired. During the second quarter, we recognized additional claims expense of $56 million relating to this discontinued product line, which adversely impacted our loss ratio by 3 points. Through the first half of 2024, we have recognized $97 million in claims activity which increased our loss ratio by 2 points. Given the claims made nature of this product, most of these losses impact our current accident year attritional loss ratio. We recognized claims expense at the time are considered probable which occurs when there is both a default on the loan and an impairment on the intellectual property collateralizing the loan. That said, loan defaults are trending both at a faster clip and at a meaningfully higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Changes in the macroeconomic conditions have put strain on early-stage businesses, resulting in less access to capital and higher loan defaults. Valuations of the intangible assets, collateralized to loans also have not held up in the workout process. We expect the majority of loss activity on this product to resolve by the end of 2025. The impact in any future quarter is unlikely to be significantly more than what has been experienced each of the past two quarters. For context, our portfolio consists of approximately 30 individual loan transactions for which we have recorded claims expense of just under half of the loans. Overall, our Specialty division under its recently refreshed management team led by Alex Martin has done a tremendous job of quickly executing on our corrective actions and improving profitability, while attending to the needs of our trading partners and insurance. We are now very focused on our product capabilities where we can add value and feel we can grow. I applaud our collective specialty team for their resiliency, tenacity and commitment. Our International division continues to produce fantastic results, achieving both significant premium growth of just over 8% and a sub-80 combined ratio for the first half of this year. We continue to push for growth both organically and through geographic expansion as well as broadening our product offerings across our existing operations. While we have seen an increase in competition and downward pressure on rates within some classes in our international book, specifically our professional liability, energy and cyber portfolios, we believe these lines are still priced at levels that meet our requirements from a rate adequacy standpoint. Our State National program services operations achieved significant premium growth of 22% for the first half, while producing consistent levels high profitability. We also continue to differentiate ourselves within the fronting market with our ability to facilitate and place complex transactions. Our team continues to be best in class and efficiently matching risk with capital, managing our exposures. Within our Nephila operations, the team has been hard at work constructing attractive portfolios and responding to heightened levels of natural catastrophe losses anticipated this year. We have both hedged risk for current capacity deployed and reduced overall premium writings, which will modestly lower our operating revenues in the short-term. However, these actions are in the long-term best interest of our investors, and we remain excited about the future prospects of our business. In our Global Reinsurance division, we remain steadfastly focused on pricing adequacy for the lines we are deploying. In the current market environment, we've lowered our required combined ratio pricing targets to reflect caution, while also being opportunistic in pockets of the book, and particularly within our marine and energy class. In general, we are walking away from deals where we believe pricing is inadequate. With that, I'd like to thank our over 5,000 associates across our insurance operations, for their exemplary efforts for the first half of the year, delivering improving results and serving our clients. Now I'll turn it back over to Tom.\nTom Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy, and Brian. And with that, we will open the floor for questions, if we may.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning, everyone. Question for you around the prior year reserve release 6.9%. It seems that Markel is often -- it seems like a consistent trend that Markel can release reserves each quarter. And so what I'm thinking is, why not initially set the loss picks lower? Or am I not thinking about it the right way?\nTom Gayner: Yeah, Andrew, this is Tom. Let me take the first pass at that, and I invite Brian to Jeremy to chime in as well. I've been at Markel for 34 years now, and have owned stocks since the IPO in 1986. And even before the IPO, the phrase that you would hear over and over again was that we set our reserves at levels that are more likely to prove redundant than deficient. That's been an unchanging value statement forever, for my lifetime for the history of this company. And I think that's hugely important because, it's important to be modest and humble about your ability to forecast what's really going to go on. So what we do is, we look at our book of business, we look at the risk, we look at our exposures. We take our best guess at what we think the ultimate loss costs are going to be. And then, because we know that number is likely to be wrong, we ask ourselves, do we want it to be wrong, the wrong way or wrong the right way. And wrong the right way, is providing some margin of safety, some margin of error to be able to absorb surprises and yet still report to you fairly what's going on, on a day-by-day basis. The other advantage to that is there's a feedback loop, between setting reserves and underwriters making new pricing decisions on business that they're writing today and going forward. And if you get that reserve number a little a little skinny or tight, which you've introduced as a feedback loop and data to your underwriter, that would cause them to perhaps potentially write new business at a thinner rate than really what should happen. So that's just a matter of philosophy. I know you're relatively new to following Markel.\nAndrew Kligerman: Yeah.\nTom Gayner: But you'll find if you go back in time, that has always been the case, and it will always be the case, because we think that's the right way to run an insurance operation.\nAndrew Kligerman: That makes a lot of sense, Tom. And I guess that -- okay, and that helps me frame the combined ratio better going forward. You seem genuinely very excited about opportunities in Markel Ventures right. And I think, I heard it right on the call, but the valuation on Valor was around $200 million plus. What are you looking at right now in terms of industries and potential price tags as you move forward?\nTom Gayner: Well, in terms of potential industry, sometimes when I'm in a cocktail party and somebody wants to know what the Markel Group does or Markel will work? I'd say we're a holding company, we hold things that most people won't touch. So we do not have an industry vertical that we seek and desire in a strategic way. We like wonderful businesses that produce good returns on capital that don't use too much debt to do it. They have management teams with integrity and talent, have reinvestment opportunities and we can get them at a fair price. And that includes a lot of different things that you can see from the array of both the things we own in Ventures and the types of risks that we write in our Insurance operation. So we're 360 degrees open. We've talked to a lot of people. We've built a lot of relationships over the years. And as a consequence, our phone rings with interesting stuff. In fact, there was one business where somebody called me and literally his opening line was \"This business was so weird, I thought of you immediately\". So fortunately, we've developed and earned a reputation over the years. Our phones are ringing more today than they did for the last couple of years. So that's why I'm excited and look forward to getting some things over the line.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Andersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Andersen: Hey, good morning. You've talked about reserve studies in-depth reviews you conducted in fourth quarter 2022 and fourth quarter 2023. But could you touch on how the quarterly approach to reserve studies has changed, if at all? Or should we continue to expect a larger widespread study conducted annually in the fourth quarter?\nJeremy Noble: Hey, it's Jeremy. I'll take that. So we do a comprehensive reserving study and analysis every quarter across the various years and products in -- in each of our divisions. What stood out the last fourth quarter period you mentioned, including the fourth quarter of this past year, was actually a more specific deeper dive in targeted areas because of some the reserving trends we have seen. So there is not to say that there is a fourth quarter annual reserve study. Our approach to reserving and that comprehensive review of the product lines is very consistent over time, but also consistent over time, is we're always looking at anything that's developing or new trends that are deviating from our actuarial expectations and what we're seeing in the data. And if there's anything that we want to do a deeper dive on, we do those sub-class studies and examinations on a very regular basis. In the first quarter and the second quarter of this year, what we've seen is that the reserve analysis and the work that we did and the selections we made at the end of year, they've held up well. And so what you're seeing coming through is favorable development sequentially higher this year to last year, and that's driven in part by some of our shorter tail lines in the U.S. space as well as across international portfolio.\nAndrew Andersen: Thanks for that. And then just on the growth within the insurance segment, 2% in the quarter, but it sounds like you're getting some rate on GL, though still being pretty cautious. Property returns are still pretty favorable. Would you expect primary insurance growth to accelerate a bit in the second half? And then maybe just with that, the session rate has ticked higher is kind of 2Q a good run rate?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. So there's any number of things that are happening in the portfolio. And you're exactly right, tails sort of two sort of stories that are happening. One is about in the insurance space. One is about the reshaping and re-underwriting and the actions we've taken kind of in those areas that we've been really focused and intentional of wanting to drive some different outcomes. I think, I mentioned that in those product lines were down over 20% year-over-year. The rest of the portfolio in the aggregate is growing and we see many pockets within the portfolio that that feel, actually pretty confident we can grow. So we'll continue to focus on -- and the opportunities we see in the International space, and then in the US space in Personal Lines and in Property and Binding and Small Commercial and Programs and Inland Marine, Managed Reliability a bunch of classes that we feel pretty good about. So even in the Casualty and Professional portfolios, where we've taken some targeted actions, we're trying to reposition and reshape those portfolios. So we still see areas of opportunity for growth. So I'm not going to kind of guide towards -- towards a top line figure, but there certainly are pockets in the portfolio that we feel confident are profitable, are priced adequately, and that we feel that there's a good Markel value proposition, and our teams are very focused on growing in those products.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fox with Fenimore. Pleas go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. In July, you did a press release on a reinsurance deal between State National and James River, which you didn't address in the Q. So I'm wondering -- if you could talk about that? And my understanding is there's some type of risk sharing in terms future development. So Jeremy, maybe you could talk about that deal? And what are the risks to the downside if things are not developing as expected?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. Sure, John. this is Jeremy. So let me touch on that. Obviously, the attention that was garnered by that transaction comes from a counterparty on the one side of the transaction. So this deal is a State National deal and State National Insurance Company entered into that loss portfolio in adverse development cover reinsurance contract with the party that you mentioned. So there's -- obviously, terms and conditions are laid out. Now actually, this is very consistent with the role that State National plays in fronting transactions. So that deal was 100% retroceded, and all of the obligations associated with that loss portfolio transfer and adverse development cover agreement were transferred to a high-quality reinsurer. And those -- that retrocession contract, we contained the same credit risk mitigation features that would be typical of state nationals long-standing risk management practices. So that's actually, I would say, we believe that, that agreement is a great example of our capabilities as the preeminent leader in the fronting space where at State National, we're able to support large complex transactions, efficiently match risk and capital utilizing those market-leading services and capabilities within the State National platform, but also still taking this credit risk mitigation features that are very typical of our long-standing state national approach. That's part of the reason also you wouldn't see it disclosed within Markel, because it's really a state national transaction. It's more a fee-for-service type of arrangement.\nJohn Fox: Okay. So when I look at the James River's release, which says State National provides $160 million adverse development, that's been reinsured out away from Markel's balance sheet?\nJeremy Noble: That's right. It's very similar to the deals that we would enter into in the fronting space with State National. There's a contract on one counterparty in the front end. There's another contract with another counterparty on the back end. We match up all those sort of terms. And that's really what that fronting model, that State National model is all about.\nJohn Fox: Okay. Great. And so staying in the weeds on reinsurance. In the Q on Page 24, it looks like there was some type of deal with Nephila and it looks like you reinsured that out also. So could you talk about the deal between Nephila and Markel in the quarter?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah. I don't have that language directly in front of me, and I don't think there was anything unique in the quarter with regards to Nephila. But however, what you may picking up on is within our other fronting operations, we've seen an uptick in the premiums there, and we're acknowledging that those premiums are associated with the Nephila platform. That is where Nephila uses our rated balance sheet in some of its products that have enhanced fee features to support some of its investors. So again, it's leveraging some of the wider tools and capabilities that we have within the Markel platform to support some of the products and capabilities that Nephila has. But again, those arrangements would be using Markel rated paper, but ultimately would be supporting third-party capital and investors.\nBrian Costanzo: Yes, John, maybe I'll add real quick. When you see other fronting kind of referred to in the Q or the press release, not all of it, but the majority of that is attributed to the Nephila transactions that Jeremy just described.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Lederer: Hi, thanks. I have a few questions on the IP business that I know you discontinued, so I apologize. But can you walk us through the claims process with that product? I guess, we understand that some of these policies trigger a claim and the amount of the full collateral regardless of its value. Is that correct? And is that part of the severity here?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, hey, Charlie, it's Jeremy. So you're right. I mean the product is -- does have a sort of a dual trigger. So really, there needs to be a default on the loan, and that loan is backed by the IP. And then you also have to have the impairment in the collateral that secures loan, so that is the intellectual property itself. So when we recognize claims or loss activity, we're reacting both to a default on the loan as well as to the impairment and the intellectual property of that entity that secured the loan.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it. And I guess how long of a process is that to determine the value of the IP or the collateral?\nJeremy Noble: Yes, it is a little bit contract to contract, but there tends to be from the point of a trigger default. I want to say something like six to nine months period to be able to actively work out kind of what comes next. And there's any number of things that could happen with regard to the sort of emerging or start-up, early-stage companies with regards to what could happen. If something doesn't occur in that sort of six to nine-month period, that would then trigger an actual default. And the settlement -- and the potential settlement of the claim.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, thanks for taking me back in the queue. Just on the intellectual property item. You mentioned, I believe, on this call and in the 10-Q that there's a possibility that you could see similar loss levels in the subsequent two quarters. Why not take reserve charge right now just to kind of capture that if you think there's a good chance that, that will occur?\nBrian Costanzo: Yes. And Andrew, this is Brian. I mean this is -- it's a tricky product. And if you think back to what Tom was talking about in our reserving philosophy, if this wasn't a unique product, that's probably what we would do. The fact that it's a claims-made product introduced a little bit of a different trigger in terms of when we recognize the claim expense. So as Jeremy mentioned, it's really looking at when we have a probable loss under that dual trigger mechanism. So there's a default on the loan, along with an impairment of the IP collateral that's backing the loan. That's well ahead of kind of when the workouts are going to finalize and when you would ultimately pay the loss, but it's also not front-loading everything upfront. The best analogy to that is kind of how a mortgage product works where you don't anticipate all the defaults on a mortgage product on day one, they kind of spread out over the life of the length of the mortgage loans that are out there.\nAndrew Kligerman: I see. So given that it's a claims-made product, does that imply then that these policies are probably not going to last through the balance of the year. So, by the end of this year, the claims that come in will be done and over with? Is that a fair way to think about it as well?\nJeremy Noble: The loans are typically four or five-year terms. So the policy is written over the duration of the loan. So the coverage lasts for the entirety of that loan, including to the ultimate repayment of the loan at the end. And so, you're monitoring each of these deals throughout the duration of the loan and measure it against that criteria on a quarterly basis that I laid out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fox with Fenimore. Please go ahead.\nJohn Fox: Hi. I guess I was getting limited to two questions. So I just want to confirm, I didn't see any cat losses disclosed in the Q. Is that correct?\nJeremy Noble: Hey John, it's Jeremy. That's correct. We tend to -- there's always a little bit of bump in things that go bump in the night as far as the catastrophes go. We tend to just record that in attritional unless there's something that really stands out.\nJohn Fox: Okay. Thank you.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Lederer: Hi. Thanks. Sorry, to harp on the IP stuff a little bit more. But last year, I think in 3Q and 4Q, you called out some losses that I think were credit losses related to the collateral not being what it was purported to be. Were there losses on top of those figures last year? I just want to make sure I kind of understand the trend.\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Sure, Charlie. It's Jeremy. So -- and the specifics are documented in our disclosures, both in last year's third quarter 10-Q as well as the most recent 10-K. So we would have said last year, total losses on the CPI product amounted to a little more than 1 point on our consolidated combined rate ratio. Approximately 60% of that would have been associated with those two fraudulent letters of credit that we spoke to. So we did acknowledge and highlight in the third fourth quarter of last year that there were also underlying losses associated with some of the defaults. And then we've seen that activity, and we've obviously quantified that activity through the first two quarters of this year. And we've talked about what could potentially happen in any future quarter as far as unlikely to be significantly more than what's experienced in this quarter. And we've said that should be done by the end of 2025 at the latest from a material standpoint, and we've given you a sense of the total size of the portfolio and how many defaults have happened. So I think we've kind of laid out on IP as much of the inputs as possible to be as transparent as possible and allow you to sort of come to your own conclusions. I do think, because there's a lot of questions, I think it's worth pointing out, the primary reason for providing some of the specifics around the CPI losses is that otherwise, it masks the improvement that we're seeing across the wider core ongoing insurance portfolios. And that's what I think is so important. We've been working really hard to navigate current market conditions, take proactive actions where necessary, grow in many diversified lines of business where we view profitability levels to be attractive. Our specialty team has been laser-focused, put CPI in runoff. There are certainly some tough lessons that we've learned, but we've turned the page and I'm confident that we're well positioned moving forward in our Specialty Insurance operations.\nCharlie Lederer: Thank you. I can definitely appreciate it and understood. I guess just a different question, I guess, just given the growth in property, can you just give us a sense of, I guess, your cat exposure in the insurance segment heading into wind season?\nJeremy Noble: Yeah, sure. Thanks for that question, Charlie. So we've actively managed our property aggregates over some period of time. We would have talked about in recent years reducing and removing some of the volatility within our book. Obviously, the consolidation of our property reinsurance capabilities through Nephila, was an example f of that. Exiting a number years ago, open market property in the international space as an example of that. Now our property writings are really sort of the core aspect of our portfolio. We've continued to opportunistically grow in that space. But in terms of across the portfolio, in terms of an average annual loss or in terms of sort of if you take out modeling out on a capital event to one or 250 [ph] or something like that, as a percentage of sort of shareholders' equity, those amounts have actually come down over time. So opportunistically taking advantage of the market, but also benefiting from a larger more well-diversified portfolio and a larger balance sheet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kligerman: This is my record and a long career of being on queue. This is my third round, very exciting. Last question for you is around Ventures. You did 5% revenue growth. And I'm kind of curious, is this a good trend line to think about going forward? And within Ventures, what businesses are really knocking the ball out of the park, and which businesses do you feel like might be a little slow at this time?\nTom Gayner: Well, thanks, Andrew. And for your gold medal round of questioning and let me tackle this in Olympic Spirit. So the rate of growth in Ventures as we sit right now is slowing a bit, and I would basically attribute that to just what you see in the overall economy. So if we think about the last three or four years, I think four factors; one, labor. We were short labored. We were trying to hire people every day, and just trying to get people in the door. Factor two, we were short inventory. We couldn't build stuff fast enough. We couldn't get fast enough, inventory conditions were short. Three, we have long order books. And that meant for orders that we had, our orders were great, and there were long lead times in getting stuff out the door because of all the things that I talked about. And there were long lag times in getting inputs and getting things in. And then fourth, we were operating in an environment of zero-ish percent interest rates. So the world was just funding anybody who had some idea that thought they could make positive returns. As we look at conditions right now, I would say, on each of those four points, labor markets are softening a little bit. So they're not there's not an unemployment crisis, but labor markets are a little softer than what they were. Two, inventory in a lot of places is building up a little bit, and this is more things we see rather than -- in our own internal operations. But we see cars on lots and we see warehouses with some stuff in it that we didn't see over the course of the last three years. Order books are a little softer. And four, interest rates exist to people's behaviors are more cautious on the hurdle rates to do anything are going up. In that kind of environment, I fully expect the top-line growth in the external conditions we operate in to be a little bit tougher. But that said, I love the team that's on the field. And I love the things that are being shaken loose by an environment like this, which when we start talking about these five-year numbers are things that add to the good. So I don't really have any current market commentary or specific businesses to point to other than what I would say about the group in aggregate.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Andersen with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Andersen: Sorry for another guidance type question, but hopefully, I'll get a pass on this one. The Reinsurance segment premium growth has really bounced around here. Can you kind of help us think about ideal size here? And is like a mid-90s combined ratio still the target in Reinsurance?\nJeremy Noble: Yes. Thanks for that, a couple of things. So premium in the -- certainly in the quarter looked to be up pretty significantly. I would suggest some of that is really due to favorable timing inception date changes on some larger deals. Some of it was selectively increasing participation on a few favorable renewals. We saw some modest new business opportunities across several product lines. And honestly, that was offset in part by non-renewals where there were some deals that didn't meet our profitability requirements. So across the collection of product capabilities we had in reinsurance. Net-net, I continue to see some modest growth opportunities, and that's what we've been seeing in the portfolio to-date. As far as the combined ratio goes, it has been a pretty sort of steady story over the last several quarters because by and large, particularly after several years ago, when we shifted our property reinsurance capabilities under one sort of umbrella and collected center excellence to Markel with Nephila, we became a very sort of long-tail oriented casualty professional and specialty shop. We look at the current underwriting years, and we feel really good about portfolio we have in place. But because it's longer tail, it's going to be -- we're going to take a while to observe the underlying trends, before we would take any credit, for hopefully what we would believe to be an improved portfolio, which means we're really seeing the noise in the combined ratio in any given period, coming down to the prior year development. And in many instances, we're reacting to anything we see, but it tends to be across a smattering deals, across smattering of underwriting years, across smattering of product lines. Not too uncommon that deals were no longer support and product areas that we no longer support as well. That creates the noise. So for the most part in any given period, you're likely -- for the foreseeable future, you're likely to see in the range that we've reported in recent quarters.\nAndrew Andersen: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks.\nTom Gayner: Thank you very much for joining us, and we look forward to reporting back to you again in another 90 days. Be well.\nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Tom Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to the Markel Group second quarter conference call. My name is Tom Gayner, and I serve as your CEO. I'm joined today by our CFO, Brian Costanzo; and the President of our Insurance Operations, Jeremy Noble. I'll make a few opening remarks and then turn things over to Brian and Jeremy to update you on our financial results and some comments on our Insurance engine. Then we will open the floor for questions. We always appreciate the chance to spend time with our partners. We cannot build the Markel Group without long-term owners who share our goals. As such, we welcome your long-term questions, thoughts and comments as fellow owners of the business. First off, we've got some good results to share with you. Brian will follow the conventions of financial reporting and share our most recent quarterly and year-to-date financial results. I will speak to some longer-term numbers. Those results will show positive contributions from each of our three engines. Our insurance engine continued to grow in the first half of 2024. Underwriting profitability improved sequentially from the first quarter. Our ongoing accounting conservatism and integrity can also be seen by ongoing favorable reserve development. We continue to produce improved underwriting results so far in 2024 despite ongoing industry-wide pressures of inflation and loss costs across almost every class of business. I am proud of our insurance teammates and their ongoing dedication to continuing improve our underwriting performance. In our Ventures operations, we set new records in sales and earnings. I think it's accurate to say that we achieved these results against a backdrop of increasingly competitive and challenging external positions. I would also describe the overall economic environment, as returning to some sense of normality after the last few years of disrupted overall conditions, supply chain challenges emerging and being dealt with, dramatic interest rate movements in both directions and other volatility creating surprises of HEP snapping speed in force. Markel Ventures continues to perform very well amidst these conditions, and I couldn't be prouder of the team's efforts and their results. One other point on Ventures is that for the last several years, we've been talking about how high transaction prices were in the buying and selling the businesses. As such, we acted with discipline and did not add any new companies to our family in 2022 or 2023. I'm pleased to report that so far in 2024, our partners at VSC and Costa Farms have acquired businesses that complement their existing offerings and footprint. We also added a new Markel Ventures company at the end of the second quarter with the purchase of a majority interest in Valor Environmental. Valor is a leading provider of erosion control, storm water management and regulatory-driven site services, and we are delighted to welcome them to the family. Valor in each of VSC and Costa transactions met our long-standing four-part tasks we use to guide us in selecting investments both public and private. Those four parts are: one, we look for businesses with good returns on capital that don't use too much debt. Second, we look for management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity; Third, we look for businesses with reinvestment opportunities and capital discipline, and four, we look for all of those first three lovely attributes at a fair price. As to Valor and the additions of Costa VSE, check-check-check and check. It's worth noting that beyond being an attractive buyer and home to sellers of long-term, multi-generation family businesses their owners. At certain times, we can be an attractive buyer for financial backers such as family offices and private equity firms. Until recently, we did not consummate any deals for those types of sellers. Higher interest rates and changing business conditions are starting to shake a few things loose from some different trees these days. We are productively engaged in way more conversations with way more kinds of sellers in this environment than it has been in the case in recent years. Stay tuned for more news as time goes by. I am personally excited by what we're seeing and what we're working on these days. Our ability to productively deploy capital at good rates of return and durable businesses that meet our four-part test is exciting to me. The skills and relationships required to invest capital wisely don't spring up overnight. We've been honing these skills for decades, and the opportunities to act on them are now growing. On the investment side, we continue to consistently follow our time-tested strategy. The recurring interest and dividend income continues to increase as each maturing bond in our portfolio is replaced with a higher coupon security. Similarly, dividend income from our high-quality portfolio of equities continues to increase. While our relative equity returns this year trails the S&P 500, we remain committed to our long-term disciplined approach. The last time we trailed the S&P by this magnitude was in the late 1990s when the market seemed possessed by a singular market focus. We stuck to our guns and preserved and protected our balance sheet. That turned out to be a good thing, when the market environment changed. It seems to me like we might be facing a similar phase change environment today as we did at that time. We have been and will remain committed to our successful time-tested low-cost and tax-efficient strategy. Finally, before I turn the call over to Brian to review the 2024 results, I want to provide some thoughts on a longer-term horizon measurement of our progress at the Markel Group. As we've stated repeatedly over the years, we aspire to build one of the world's great companies, and we mean to do so in an enduring fashion. As one tool to foster long-term behavior, internally, we measure our performance over five-year intervals to judge our performance and calculate incentive compensation. We do so in an effort to constantly remain focused on longer-term accomplishments rather than quarterly or annual measures. Five years ago, at June 30, 2019, we had total net investments, that is our entire investment portfolio plus cash minus debt of $17.5 billion. As of June 30, 2024, that number stands at $28.2 billion, an increase of 61%. Five years ago through June 30, 2019, we earned underwriting and insurance income of $142 million. Five years later, through June 30, 2024, we earned underwriting and insurance income of $313 million, an increase of 120%. Five years ago through June 30, 2019, we earned $133 million of operating income in our Markel Ventures operations. Through June 30, 2024, we earned $281 million of operating income, an increase of 112%. At June 30, 2019, each share of Markel sold for about $1,100. At June 30, 2024, each share of Markel sold for about $1,575, an increase of about 43%. The share price change is the lowest number on the page. In response to our own calculation of the intrinsic value per share of Markel, and the array of opportunities available to us to productively deploy capital, we've repurchased Markel shares. Five years ago, the share count stood at 13.826 million shares. At June 30, 2024, it stood at 12.962 million, a decrease of almost 1 million shares. The vast majority of these repurchases took place in the 2022 through 2024 time frame. It seems to me that math indicates we're looking at the circumstance of more company divided by fewer shares. I think that this ought to produce excellent returns for our shareholders over time. Even more important than the numbers, is the way the numbers get achieved. The numbers are the outcome and the results of our culture and the efforts of people of this company. As we say in the first paragraph of our culture statement, the Markel Style, we believe in hard work and zealous pursuit of excellence while keeping a sense of humor. Our creed is honesty and fairness in all of our dealings. I am proud of the people Markel and I thank them for their ongoing efforts to build our company around such wonderful principles. With that, I'd like to turn things over to Brian. But wait, before I do, I just want to interject here, my frac and able wonderful assistance Cynthia Featherman actually deployed the tools of AI to take my comments and ask Microsoft copilot to write a poem about what I just said. This will only take a second, but I can't help, but share it with you. So you're good. We're glad to share some news with you about our quarter 2 review. We have 3 engines that fuel our Fire, Insurance, Ventures and Investments they inspire. Our Insurance engine showed its skill in underwriting despite some mills. Our ventures engine soared to new heights in sales and earnings and new buys. Our Investment engine stuck to our plan of low-cost, tax-efficient and brand. We track our progress over 5 years, we see more value and less fears. We also bought back some of our stock to show you that we value your lock. We thank you for your trust in backing, and we hope you'll join our unpacking. So with that AI augmented presentation, let me turn it over to you, Brian. Thank you, Jeremy, and Brian. And with that, we will open the floor for questions, if we may. Yeah, Andrew, this is Tom. Let me take the first pass at that, and I invite Brian to Jeremy to chime in as well. I've been at Markel for 34 years now, and have owned stocks since the IPO in 1986. And even before the IPO, the phrase that you would hear over and over again was that we set our reserves at levels that are more likely to prove redundant than deficient. That's been an unchanging value statement forever, for my lifetime for the history of this company. And I think that's hugely important because, it's important to be modest and humble about your ability to forecast what's really going to go on. So what we do is, we look at our book of business, we look at the risk, we look at our exposures. We take our best guess at what we think the ultimate loss costs are going to be. And then, because we know that number is likely to be wrong, we ask ourselves, do we want it to be wrong, the wrong way or wrong the right way. And wrong the right way, is providing some margin of safety, some margin of error to be able to absorb surprises and yet still report to you fairly what's going on, on a day-by-day basis. The other advantage to that is there's a feedback loop, between setting reserves and underwriters making new pricing decisions on business that they're writing today and going forward. And if you get that reserve number a little a little skinny or tight, which you've introduced as a feedback loop and data to your underwriter, that would cause them to perhaps potentially write new business at a thinner rate than really what should happen. So that's just a matter of philosophy. I know you're relatively new to following Markel. But you'll find if you go back in time, that has always been the case, and it will always be the case, because we think that's the right way to run an insurance operation. Well, in terms of potential industry, sometimes when I'm in a cocktail party and somebody wants to know what the Markel Group does or Markel will work? I'd say we're a holding company, we hold things that most people won't touch. So we do not have an industry vertical that we seek and desire in a strategic way. We like wonderful businesses that produce good returns on capital that don't use too much debt to do it. They have management teams with integrity and talent, have reinvestment opportunities and we can get them at a fair price. And that includes a lot of different things that you can see from the array of both the things we own in Ventures and the types of risks that we write in our Insurance operation. So we're 360 degrees open. We've talked to a lot of people. We've built a lot of relationships over the years. And as a consequence, our phone rings with interesting stuff. In fact, there was one business where somebody called me and literally his opening line was \"This business was so weird, I thought of you immediately\". So fortunately, we've developed and earned a reputation over the years. Our phones are ringing more today than they did for the last couple of years. So that's why I'm excited and look forward to getting some things over the line. Well, thanks, Andrew. And for your gold medal round of questioning and let me tackle this in Olympic Spirit. So the rate of growth in Ventures as we sit right now is slowing a bit, and I would basically attribute that to just what you see in the overall economy. So if we think about the last three or four years, I think four factors; one, labor. We were short labored. We were trying to hire people every day, and just trying to get people in the door. Factor two, we were short inventory. We couldn't build stuff fast enough. We couldn't get fast enough, inventory conditions were short. Three, we have long order books. And that meant for orders that we had, our orders were great, and there were long lead times in getting stuff out the door because of all the things that I talked about. And there were long lag times in getting inputs and getting things in. And then fourth, we were operating in an environment of zero-ish percent interest rates. So the world was just funding anybody who had some idea that thought they could make positive returns. As we look at conditions right now, I would say, on each of those four points, labor markets are softening a little bit. So they're not there's not an unemployment crisis, but labor markets are a little softer than what they were. Two, inventory in a lot of places is building up a little bit, and this is more things we see rather than -- in our own internal operations. But we see cars on lots and we see warehouses with some stuff in it that we didn't see over the course of the last three years. Order books are a little softer. And four, interest rates exist to people's behaviors are more cautious on the hurdle rates to do anything are going up. In that kind of environment, I fully expect the top-line growth in the external conditions we operate in to be a little bit tougher. But that said, I love the team that's on the field. And I love the things that are being shaken loose by an environment like this, which when we start talking about these five-year numbers are things that add to the good. So I don't really have any current market commentary or specific businesses to point to other than what I would say about the group in aggregate. Thank you very much for joining us, and we look forward to reporting back to you again in another 90 days. Be well."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. It'd be hard to top that. Maybe we can make Dr. [indiscernible] out of that poem there. Excited to be here this morning to discuss our results for the first half of 2024. Each of our 3 engines, Insurance, Investments and Markel Ventures made significant contributions to our first half results. Starting off with the consolidated results. Total revenues increased 5% to $8.2 billion for the first half of 2024, and total operating income increased slightly year-over-year to $1.75 billion with the largest driver of growth being a 34% increase in our net investment income. Net income to common shareholders was $1.3 billion in the first half of 2024 compared to $1.2 in the same period of 2023. The comprehensive income to shareholders in the first half of both 2024 and 2023 was $1.2 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion in the first half of 2024 compared to $1 billion in the same period of 2023. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines with the most significant contribution coming from our Insurance engine. In May, we issued $600 million of 30-year 6% unsecured senior notes, bringing our debt-to-capital ratio to 22%. In the first half of 2024, we repurchased $260 million of Markel Group common stock under our outstanding share repurchase program compared to $187 million in the same period of last year. Turning now to the performance of our 3 operating engines and starting with our Insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew by 6% to $5.7 billion for the first half of 2024 compared to $5.4 billion in the same period of 2023. Our increased premium volume was driven by our International Marine & Energy Insurance and Reinsurance business and growth on select US lines of business, including personal lines and programs. This was partially offset by targeted premium contraction in select classes within our US professional liability and general liability portfolios where we took underwriting actions to improve profitability. Jeremy will discuss these actions in more detail within his commentary. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first half of 2024 was 94% compared to 93% in the same period of 2023. The 1 point increase was due to higher attritional loss ratios on our professional liability and general liability insurance product lines, as we remain prudent in adding margin to classes with challenging loss trends. Also, we recognized losses on our discontinued intellectual property collateral protection insurance product. On year-to-date 2024 consolidated combined ratio, we included $96.8 million or 2 points of losses on our CPI product line. Prior year loss reserves development improved over the first half of 2024 to $221 million in loss takedowns versus $139 million in 2023. Favorable development in the first half of 2024 was most notable within our International Professional Liability product lines. We remain cautious in our approach to reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer-tail US Professional Liability and General Liability lines given recent claim trends. Within our Program Services and ILS operations, operating income increased 23% to $61 million primarily driven by strong growth and performance in our fronting businesses. Moving next to our investment results. We reported net investment income of $441 million in the first half of 2024 compared to $329 million in the same period last year. Net investment income reflects the recurring interest and dividends earned on our investment portfolio. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as the yield on our fixed maturity portfolio, short-term investments and cash equivalents all increased compared to the first half of 2023. We expect, based on the current interest rate environment that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. At June 30, 2024, the book yield on our fixed maturity portfolio was 3.4%, up from just over 3% at the end of last year. Net investment gains $772 million in 2024 reflect favorable market movements, resulting in a return of 8.9% on our public equity portfolio for the first six months of 2024. This compares to net investment gains of $857 million for the first half of 2023. As you've heard us say many times before, we focus on long-term investment performance, expecting variability in the equity markets from period to period. At the end of June, fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pretax unrealized gains of $6.9 billion. Net unrealized investment losses included in other comprehensive loss in the first half of 2024, or $152 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment gains of $30 net of taxes in the same period of 2023. Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturity investments until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to the change in interest rates to reverse future periods as bonds mature. We continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of June 30, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. Finally, I'll cover the results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 4% in the first half of 2024 versus the same period of 2023, reflecting moderate revenue increases at many of our products businesses as well as contributions from an acquisition made by one of our businesses in the first quarter of 2024. Markel Ventures operating income increased 7%, driven by higher revenues and improved operating margins at our consumer and building products businesses. As Tom mentioned, we also completed the acquisition of Valor Environmental late in the second quarter, adding to our family of businesses within Markel Ventures. Inclusion of operating results from Valor will begin in the third quarter. For our June financials, the preliminary allocation of purchase price includes $108 million to million to goodwill and $49 intangible assets. With that, I will turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our insurance engine. Yes, John, maybe I'll add real quick. When you see other fronting kind of referred to in the Q or the press release, not all of it, but the majority of that is attributed to the Nephila transactions that Jeremy just described. Yes. And Andrew, this is Brian. I mean this is -- it's a tricky product. And if you think back to what Tom was talking about in our reserving philosophy, if this wasn't a unique product, that's probably what we would do. The fact that it's a claims-made product introduced a little bit of a different trigger in terms of when we recognize the claim expense. So as Jeremy mentioned, it's really looking at when we have a probable loss under that dual trigger mechanism. So there's a default on the loan, along with an impairment of the IP collateral that's backing the loan. That's well ahead of kind of when the workouts are going to finalize and when you would ultimately pay the loss, but it's also not front-loading everything upfront. The best analogy to that is kind of how a mortgage product works where you don't anticipate all the defaults on a mortgage product on day one, they kind of spread out over the life of the length of the mortgage loans that are out there."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here with you to discuss our progress within the insurance engine over the first half of this year. Our results continued to improve this year, coming off elevated combined ratio results during the latter half of 2023 due to prior year's reserve strengthening. Our combined ratio for the second quarter improved sequentially and our first half combined ratio is where we expected to be at this point in the year despite higher losses within our intellectual property collateral protection portfolio which is in runoff. As Brian shared, we experienced greater favorable development on prior year's reserves through six months of 2024 than a year ago, and have not seen meaningful further development in the products we addressed at year-end. Overall, our operating revenue growth and underwriting gross written premium growth in the first half of the year reflects the actions we have taken to improve profitability. Within our Insurance segment, the lines where I have previously discussed us taking significant underwriting action to improve profitability, namely our brokerage excess and umbrella and brokerage contractors books within general liability, and risk-managed professional liability classes, we decreased writings year-to-date by over 20%. The remainder of our products in our Insurance segment, where we are generally achieving good levels of profitability and are satisfied with rate adequacy have grown 8% in the aggregate. Now let me briefly take you through each of our divisions for the first half of the year. First off, within our Specialty Division, we continue to benefit from the corrective actions taken within select classes in our casualty and professional liability books, while will also remain cautious on current accident year loss picks in these areas. This is most evident the gross written premium reductions in select classes of our casualty and professional books. I mentioned earlier. But specifically, we continue to pursue growth profitable product classes, including personal lines, property, inland marine, binding and small commercial, managed reliability and select programs business. Many of these lines are achieving meaningful rate increases. An exception is property, where in the past few months, we have seen a contraction in rates back to low single digits but still at attractive pricing levels. The growth in these lines is improving the product mix and overall combined ratio of the division as our premium earnings mix changes. Within casualty and professional liability classes, we continue to execute on our corrective underwriting action plans within certain pockets of the portfolio, where results have not met our expectations. During the first half of the year, our recently discontinued Intellectual Property Collateral Protection product line negatively impacted our combined ratio performance due to an increase in the frequency of defaults on loans collateralized by intellectual property that became impaired. During the second quarter, we recognized additional claims expense of $56 million relating to this discontinued product line, which adversely impacted our loss ratio by 3 points. Through the first half of 2024, we have recognized $97 million in claims activity which increased our loss ratio by 2 points. Given the claims made nature of this product, most of these losses impact our current accident year attritional loss ratio. We recognized claims expense at the time are considered probable which occurs when there is both a default on the loan and an impairment on the intellectual property collateralizing the loan. That said, loan defaults are trending both at a faster clip and at a meaningfully higher level than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Changes in the macroeconomic conditions have put strain on early-stage businesses, resulting in less access to capital and higher loan defaults. Valuations of the intangible assets, collateralized to loans also have not held up in the workout process. We expect the majority of loss activity on this product to resolve by the end of 2025. The impact in any future quarter is unlikely to be significantly more than what has been experienced each of the past two quarters. For context, our portfolio consists of approximately 30 individual loan transactions for which we have recorded claims expense of just under half of the loans. Overall, our Specialty division under its recently refreshed management team led by Alex Martin has done a tremendous job of quickly executing on our corrective actions and improving profitability, while attending to the needs of our trading partners and insurance. We are now very focused on our product capabilities where we can add value and feel we can grow. I applaud our collective specialty team for their resiliency, tenacity and commitment. Our International division continues to produce fantastic results, achieving both significant premium growth of just over 8% and a sub-80 combined ratio for the first half of this year. We continue to push for growth both organically and through geographic expansion as well as broadening our product offerings across our existing operations. While we have seen an increase in competition and downward pressure on rates within some classes in our international book, specifically our professional liability, energy and cyber portfolios, we believe these lines are still priced at levels that meet our requirements from a rate adequacy standpoint. Our State National program services operations achieved significant premium growth of 22% for the first half, while producing consistent levels high profitability. We also continue to differentiate ourselves within the fronting market with our ability to facilitate and place complex transactions. Our team continues to be best in class and efficiently matching risk with capital, managing our exposures. Within our Nephila operations, the team has been hard at work constructing attractive portfolios and responding to heightened levels of natural catastrophe losses anticipated this year. We have both hedged risk for current capacity deployed and reduced overall premium writings, which will modestly lower our operating revenues in the short-term. However, these actions are in the long-term best interest of our investors, and we remain excited about the future prospects of our business. In our Global Reinsurance division, we remain steadfastly focused on pricing adequacy for the lines we are deploying. In the current market environment, we've lowered our required combined ratio pricing targets to reflect caution, while also being opportunistic in pockets of the book, and particularly within our marine and energy class. In general, we are walking away from deals where we believe pricing is inadequate. With that, I'd like to thank our over 5,000 associates across our insurance operations, for their exemplary efforts for the first half of the year, delivering improving results and serving our clients. Now I'll turn it back over to Tom. Hey, it's Jeremy. I'll take that. So we do a comprehensive reserving study and analysis every quarter across the various years and products in -- in each of our divisions. What stood out the last fourth quarter period you mentioned, including the fourth quarter of this past year, was actually a more specific deeper dive in targeted areas because of some the reserving trends we have seen. So there is not to say that there is a fourth quarter annual reserve study. Our approach to reserving and that comprehensive review of the product lines is very consistent over time, but also consistent over time, is we're always looking at anything that's developing or new trends that are deviating from our actuarial expectations and what we're seeing in the data. And if there's anything that we want to do a deeper dive on, we do those sub-class studies and examinations on a very regular basis. In the first quarter and the second quarter of this year, what we've seen is that the reserve analysis and the work that we did and the selections we made at the end of year, they've held up well. And so what you're seeing coming through is favorable development sequentially higher this year to last year, and that's driven in part by some of our shorter tail lines in the U.S. space as well as across international portfolio. Yeah. So there's any number of things that are happening in the portfolio. And you're exactly right, tails sort of two sort of stories that are happening. One is about in the insurance space. One is about the reshaping and re-underwriting and the actions we've taken kind of in those areas that we've been really focused and intentional of wanting to drive some different outcomes. I think, I mentioned that in those product lines were down over 20% year-over-year. The rest of the portfolio in the aggregate is growing and we see many pockets within the portfolio that that feel, actually pretty confident we can grow. So we'll continue to focus on -- and the opportunities we see in the International space, and then in the US space in Personal Lines and in Property and Binding and Small Commercial and Programs and Inland Marine, Managed Reliability a bunch of classes that we feel pretty good about. So even in the Casualty and Professional portfolios, where we've taken some targeted actions, we're trying to reposition and reshape those portfolios. So we still see areas of opportunity for growth. So I'm not going to kind of guide towards -- towards a top line figure, but there certainly are pockets in the portfolio that we feel confident are profitable, are priced adequately, and that we feel that there's a good Markel value proposition, and our teams are very focused on growing in those products. Yeah. Sure, John. this is Jeremy. So let me touch on that. Obviously, the attention that was garnered by that transaction comes from a counterparty on the one side of the transaction. So this deal is a State National deal and State National Insurance Company entered into that loss portfolio in adverse development cover reinsurance contract with the party that you mentioned. So there's -- obviously, terms and conditions are laid out. Now actually, this is very consistent with the role that State National plays in fronting transactions. So that deal was 100% retroceded, and all of the obligations associated with that loss portfolio transfer and adverse development cover agreement were transferred to a high-quality reinsurer. And those -- that retrocession contract, we contained the same credit risk mitigation features that would be typical of state nationals long-standing risk management practices. So that's actually, I would say, we believe that, that agreement is a great example of our capabilities as the preeminent leader in the fronting space where at State National, we're able to support large complex transactions, efficiently match risk and capital utilizing those market-leading services and capabilities within the State National platform, but also still taking this credit risk mitigation features that are very typical of our long-standing state national approach. That's part of the reason also you wouldn't see it disclosed within Markel, because it's really a state national transaction. It's more a fee-for-service type of arrangement. That's right. It's very similar to the deals that we would enter into in the fronting space with State National. There's a contract on one counterparty in the front end. There's another contract with another counterparty on the back end. We match up all those sort of terms. And that's really what that fronting model, that State National model is all about. Yeah. I don't have that language directly in front of me, and I don't think there was anything unique in the quarter with regards to Nephila. But however, what you may picking up on is within our other fronting operations, we've seen an uptick in the premiums there, and we're acknowledging that those premiums are associated with the Nephila platform. That is where Nephila uses our rated balance sheet in some of its products that have enhanced fee features to support some of its investors. So again, it's leveraging some of the wider tools and capabilities that we have within the Markel platform to support some of the products and capabilities that Nephila has. But again, those arrangements would be using Markel rated paper, but ultimately would be supporting third-party capital and investors. Yes, hey, Charlie, it's Jeremy. So you're right. I mean the product is -- does have a sort of a dual trigger. So really, there needs to be a default on the loan, and that loan is backed by the IP. And then you also have to have the impairment in the collateral that secures loan, so that is the intellectual property itself. So when we recognize claims or loss activity, we're reacting both to a default on the loan as well as to the impairment and the intellectual property of that entity that secured the loan. Yes, it is a little bit contract to contract, but there tends to be from the point of a trigger default. I want to say something like six to nine months period to be able to actively work out kind of what comes next. And there's any number of things that could happen with regard to the sort of emerging or start-up, early-stage companies with regards to what could happen. If something doesn't occur in that sort of six to nine-month period, that would then trigger an actual default. And the settlement -- and the potential settlement of the claim. The loans are typically four or five-year terms. So the policy is written over the duration of the loan. So the coverage lasts for the entirety of that loan, including to the ultimate repayment of the loan at the end. And so, you're monitoring each of these deals throughout the duration of the loan and measure it against that criteria on a quarterly basis that I laid out. Hey John, it's Jeremy. That's correct. We tend to -- there's always a little bit of bump in things that go bump in the night as far as the catastrophes go. We tend to just record that in attritional unless there's something that really stands out. Yes. Thanks. Yes. Sure, Charlie. It's Jeremy. So -- and the specifics are documented in our disclosures, both in last year's third quarter 10-Q as well as the most recent 10-K. So we would have said last year, total losses on the CPI product amounted to a little more than 1 point on our consolidated combined rate ratio. Approximately 60% of that would have been associated with those two fraudulent letters of credit that we spoke to. So we did acknowledge and highlight in the third fourth quarter of last year that there were also underlying losses associated with some of the defaults. And then we've seen that activity, and we've obviously quantified that activity through the first two quarters of this year. And we've talked about what could potentially happen in any future quarter as far as unlikely to be significantly more than what's experienced in this quarter. And we've said that should be done by the end of 2025 at the latest from a material standpoint, and we've given you a sense of the total size of the portfolio and how many defaults have happened. So I think we've kind of laid out on IP as much of the inputs as possible to be as transparent as possible and allow you to sort of come to your own conclusions. I do think, because there's a lot of questions, I think it's worth pointing out, the primary reason for providing some of the specifics around the CPI losses is that otherwise, it masks the improvement that we're seeing across the wider core ongoing insurance portfolios. And that's what I think is so important. We've been working really hard to navigate current market conditions, take proactive actions where necessary, grow in many diversified lines of business where we view profitability levels to be attractive. Our specialty team has been laser-focused, put CPI in runoff. There are certainly some tough lessons that we've learned, but we've turned the page and I'm confident that we're well positioned moving forward in our Specialty Insurance operations. Yeah, sure. Thanks for that question, Charlie. So we've actively managed our property aggregates over some period of time. We would have talked about in recent years reducing and removing some of the volatility within our book. Obviously, the consolidation of our property reinsurance capabilities through Nephila, was an example f of that. Exiting a number years ago, open market property in the international space as an example of that. Now our property writings are really sort of the core aspect of our portfolio. We've continued to opportunistically grow in that space. But in terms of across the portfolio, in terms of an average annual loss or in terms of sort of if you take out modeling out on a capital event to one or 250 [ph] or something like that, as a percentage of sort of shareholders' equity, those amounts have actually come down over time. So opportunistically taking advantage of the market, but also benefiting from a larger more well-diversified portfolio and a larger balance sheet. Yes. Thanks for that, a couple of things. So premium in the -- certainly in the quarter looked to be up pretty significantly. I would suggest some of that is really due to favorable timing inception date changes on some larger deals. Some of it was selectively increasing participation on a few favorable renewals. We saw some modest new business opportunities across several product lines. And honestly, that was offset in part by non-renewals where there were some deals that didn't meet our profitability requirements. So across the collection of product capabilities we had in reinsurance. Net-net, I continue to see some modest growth opportunities, and that's what we've been seeing in the portfolio to-date. As far as the combined ratio goes, it has been a pretty sort of steady story over the last several quarters because by and large, particularly after several years ago, when we shifted our property reinsurance capabilities under one sort of umbrella and collected center excellence to Markel with Nephila, we became a very sort of long-tail oriented casualty professional and specialty shop. We look at the current underwriting years, and we feel really good about portfolio we have in place. But because it's longer tail, it's going to be -- we're going to take a while to observe the underlying trends, before we would take any credit, for hopefully what we would believe to be an improved portfolio, which means we're really seeing the noise in the combined ratio in any given period, coming down to the prior year development. And in many instances, we're reacting to anything we see, but it tends to be across a smattering deals, across smattering of underwriting years, across smattering of product lines. Not too uncommon that deals were no longer support and product areas that we no longer support as well. That creates the noise. So for the most part in any given period, you're likely -- for the foreseeable future, you're likely to see in the range that we've reported in recent quarters."

Please go ahead. \nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Sarah. I appreciate it. Good morning, and welcome to the Markel Group First Quarter Conference Call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, your CEO. I'm joined today by Brian Costanzo, our CFO; and Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance operations. \n As always, we look forward to checking in with you about our results. We view our long-term shareholders as partners. We welcome the chance to provide you with an update on how things are going as well as our plans and dreams for the future. We also look forward to answering your thoughtful questions. \n As a quick review of the bidding, at the Markel Group, we are working to build one of the world's great companies. We view a great company as one that operates a win-win-win system. We want our customers to win because they bought products and services from us that served their needs. We want our associates to win by serving our customers, supporting their families and communities, continuously learning and being creative. We want our shareholders to win as we earn profitable results on the capital we use to do this work. That's what win-win-win means to us. \n I'm delighted to report to you that we're off to a good start in doing exactly that so far in 2024. I'm going to channel my inner chasm right now by saying in 1972, Johnny Nash recorded a #1 hit called, \"I can see clearly now the rain is gone\". You have no idea how hard it is for me to just say the title without singing it. In 1993, Jimmy Cliff covered it for the movie, \"Cool Runnings\". Well, covering that song continues. The Markel Group is laying down tracks of another cover so far in 2024, and we'll do our best to work our way through the verses as the year progresses. \n Brian will quantify the notes with numbers in just a minute, but let me speak qualitatively about the music. Here's why that song comes to mind for me. I've got 4 bullet points in mind. Usually, I try to keep the list to 3, but I just can't help myself today. \n Point one: we've got improving results in our insurance engine. Jeremy will provide you with some details in a few minutes. I want to thank him and his team personally for the efforts they have expended in improving our results. I am grateful for their work. Thank you. \n Point two: Our Ventures companies continue to produce excellent results. I want to express my appreciation to the leaders of the Markel Ventures companies and their teams for their accomplishments. \n Point three: we enjoyed excellent returns on our investment operations. Recurring investment income continues to rise rapidly. We're investing our cash flows from operations and maturing bonds into higher-yielding securities. Dividends from our holdings of publicly traded equities also continue to grow. \n Point four: we continue to repurchase our shares. We started to repurchase shares in meaningful quantities in 2022 as we believed the share price traded at a significant discount to our calculation of what we thought a share of Markel was worth. In 2023, we thought that gap widened, so we bought more shares than we did in 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, we thought the gap widened more, so we bought more. In fact, we nearly doubled our purchases in the first quarter to $161 million compared to $82 million a year ago. From roughly 14 million outstanding shares as recently as February 2019, we ended the first quarter with 13 million. And as we speak now, we are below that milestone. Each share of the Markel Group continues to own a greater percentage of our Insurance, Ventures and Investment operations. As a shareholder myself, with the majority of my net worth in Markel stock, that seems like a good thing to me. \n If we continue to earn the sort of returns that we are now and if the marketplace continues to assign a meaningful discount to our shares, at our current rate of repurchases, we'll get the share count down to 1 in a little over 30 years. I suspect the market will catch on before we get to that point. \n Also, in recognition of our commitment to long-term thinking and progress, we updated our press release format to include 5 years of data as well as that of the current quarter. We remain focused on long-term actions and measures, and we hope the new format speaks to that commitment. The format also describes the metrics we use to calculate incentive compensation. We think 5-year measurement periods do a good job of demonstrating our commitment to long-term accomplishments and accountability. We also hope that the report provides clarity as to how we measure progress. \n Finally, I'd like to reiterate our invitation to join us for our upcoming Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which we call \"The Reunion\". We'll be back at the Robins Center at the University of Richmond on May 22, and we'll start at 2:00 p.m. Last year, we had so many people that traffic got clogged. We encourage you to come early. The Annual Meeting is the best setting to enjoy the company of your fellow shareholders, see what condition our condition is in, ask questions of management and meet some of the people of Markel from all around the world. Please make sure you register at www.mklreunion.com so that we can have credentials ready for you to get into the Robins Center quickly. \n I love our team, and I am proud of what they continue to accomplish. I hope you feel the same way, and I look forward to seeing as many of you in person in May as is possible. \n Before I turn it over to Brian, I'll share what I hope to be saying in upcoming periods. As Johnny Nash saying after the first line of \"I can see clearly now\", \"I can see all obstacles in my way. Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind, it's going to be a bright-bright-bright Sun Shiny Day.\" That's what I hope to be saying in future calls. We will do our best to make it so. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Jeremy will follow with his comments and then we'll open up the floor for your questions. Brian? \nBrian Costanzo: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the quarter's results, I'll make a few comments on the changes within our earnings release and 10-Q for the quarter. We believe these changes provide a clear picture of our overall performance. \n First, we moved to a consistent measure of profitability of operating income across each segment of our business that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets. We do not consider these costs when assessing the performance of our businesses and believe it helps investors to provide a consistent performance metric across our operating segments. \n Additionally, as Tom mentioned, we incorporated a longer-term view of our key metrics within our press release to provide more perspective on our performance, consistent with how we evaluate performance for incentive compensation purposes. In any given quarter or year, there are many factors that can create volatility in results, which is why we consistently measure our performance over 5-year periods. We hope you'll find these changes helpful as you review our results. \n With that, let me take you through our consolidated results for the period. Total revenues increased 23% to $4.5 billion with each of our 3 engines achieving year-over-year top line growth, with the most notable growth coming from our Investments engine. Operating income grew by 77% to $1.3 billion during the first quarter, driven largely by an increase in net investment gains in the quarter, highlighting our longer-term view where short-term changes in the valuation of our equity portfolio are more normalized, we have created cumulative operating income of $8.7 billion over the past 4 years plus the first quarter of this year. \n Total net income to common shareholders was $1 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $489 million in the same period of 2023, with the change primarily attributable to higher net investment gains on our public equity portfolio in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. \n Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first quarter of 2024 was $909 million compared to $646 million in the same period of 2023, with the favorable change in the public equity valuations being partially offset by an unfavorable swing in our fixed maturity portfolio. \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $631 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $284 million in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines, with the most significant contribution coming from our Insurance engine. \n Total shareholders' equity stood at $15.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the first quarter, we repurchased $161 million worth of shares of Markel Group's stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, compared to $82 million in the same period last year. \n With that, I'll now turn to the performance of each of our operating engines, starting off with our Insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew 4% to $2.8 billion for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.7 billion for the same period last year. Our increased premium volume reflects new business growth and more favorable rates on many lines within our international portfolio and select U.S. lines of business. We are working hard to rebalance our diversified portfolio of products, which has resulted in contracting premium writings in certain classes, particularly within pockets of our U.S. professional liability and general liability portfolios. Jeremy will go into more detail about changes in the mix of business and the impact of our underwriting actions on top line premiums in his comments. \n Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter was 95% compared to 94% in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher attritional loss ratio within our U.S. general liability and professional liability product lines within our Insurance segment. \n Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $77 million this year versus $71 million in the first quarter of 2023. Favorable development in the first quarter this year was most notable within our international professional liability and marine and energy product lines. \n We remain cautious and conservative in our approach to both current year losses and reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer-tail U.S. professional liability and general liability lines, given recent claim trends. Within our program services and ILS operations, operating income increased 33% to $23 million, primarily driven by growth within program services and other fronting. \n Moving next to our Investments results. We reported net investment income of $218 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $159 million in the same period last year. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as the yield on our fixed maturity portfolio, short-term investments and cash equivalents all increased. Additionally, we have been allocating more cash to money market funds and fixed maturity securities to capitalize on the higher interest rate environment. We expect, based on the current interest rates, that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. \n Net investment gains of $902 million in 2024 reflect favorable market movements, resulting in a return of 9.8% on our public equity portfolio in the first quarter. This compares to net investment gains of $373 million in the first quarter of 2023. \n As you've heard us say often before, and I'm sure you'll hear me say again, we focus on long-term investment performance expecting variability in the equity markets from period to period. At the end of March, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pretax unrealized gains of $7 billion. \n Net unrealized investment losses and other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2024 were $123 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment gains of $164 million net of taxes in the same period last year. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. \n Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to the changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. \n Additionally, we continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of March 31, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. \n Finally, I'll turn to our results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 3% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, reflecting moderate revenue increases at our consumer and building products and construction services businesses. \n Markel Ventures' operating income increased 13% driven by higher revenues and improved operating margins at our consumer and building products businesses versus a year ago. Our Markel Ventures companies continue their excellent long-term performance and meaningful contribution to our operating results and cash flows. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our Insurance engine. \nJeremy Noble: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. As you heard from Tom and Brian, the actions we took from the start of the year to improve the overall health of our insurance operations are beginning to bear fruit. We spent much of the first quarter implementing the significant corrective underwriting actions that I discussed on our earnings call a quarter ago, which I believe will improve future profitability. These steps addressed where we recently underperformed, particularly within our U.S. specialty insurance operations. At the same time, we work to meaningfully grow in the products, geographic territories and industries where performance meets or exceeds our long-term profitability targets. \n For the first quarter of 2024, our combined ratio was 95%. That result exceeds our ultimate goal, but is in line with where we expected to be at this point in the year. It also shows meaningful improvement from where we stood in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. \n The impact of our portfolio management actions are most evident in our gross written premium volume for the first quarter. On the surface, we grew a modest 4% versus a year ago. However, you need to disaggregate that growth a bit to appreciate the effectiveness of our underwriting actions. \n We use portfolio management tools each quarter to monitor portfolio health and rate adequacy and to evaluate the profitability of each of our products. You might think of this like a traffic light system, where we assign a color of green, yellow or red to each product line. Those colors show the degree of rate adequacy and associated combined ratio deviation for market profitability target for each product. I'll use this construct to demonstrate how we are remixing the portfolio towards our most profitable lines. \n Within our green product classes, which represent products that are significantly outperforming our combined ratio targets, our premiums grew by 14% during the first quarter. Around 40% of our overall gross written premiums fall into this category at the moment. \n On the flip side, our red product classes where profitability is underperforming our combined ratio targets, gross premium volume decreased by 16% during the first quarter. At present, a little more than 10% of our portfolio falls in this category, which is actively being managed. \n Let me be clear, for many of these lines, we are still operating in an underwriting profit, but at a combined ratio that is above our target. For each product, we have a robust set of underwriting action plans to get us back to an acceptable level of profitability in a reasonable period of time, and our plans take into consideration current market dynamics and long-standing relationships. \n This contraction in the first quarter of '24, focused on several product classes within our U.S. and Bermuda casualty and professional liability portfolio. These underwriting actions were most notable in our brokerage excess and umbrella and brokerage primary contractors general liability lines within casualty. And our large account risk managed errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines within professional liability. \n Our underwriting actions consist of a mixture of rate increases, changes to terms and conditions, evaluation of limited attachment points and redistribution of geographical or industry mix. We also decreased the overall proportion of construction business within our casualty portfolio and improved the profitability outlook for our existing book. \n In certain instances, we identified product lines that were not expected to be profitable. In these circumstances, we made more meaningful changes, including exiting certain products or subclasses. We discontinued writing several product classes in our Insurance segment in the first quarter, where we believe underwriting action plans would not enable us to reach our profitability goals. Some of the areas we exited included retail primary casualty, risk-managed architects and engineers and intellectual property collateral protection lines. \n In total, the lines and subclasses we exited represented less than 2% of our Insurance segment operations on an annual basis. \n We also non-renewed a handful of professional liability quota share contracts within our Reinsurance segment that did not meet our pricing targets. \n Overall, we remain thoughtful and disciplined about how we handle long-term portfolio management. \n Turning to the positive. We've seen profitable growth within our U.S. specialty insurance operations within our property and inland marine, personal lines, programs, binding and commercial professional liability products. Within our international portfolio, we've seen profitable growth across a number of products, including our marine and energy, U.K. and European businesses. \n Within our Global Reinsurance operations, we opportunistically pursued growth within the London market specialty marine and energy space. With a large, well-diversified global platform, we see plenty of opportunities to grow and enhance our overall portfolio construction. We are focused on doing just that. \n We've taken strong and decisive actions to deliver improved combined ratio results going forward. It will take time for these underwriting actions to earn through and impact our combined ratio, but we're confident that we're on the right track. \n Meanwhile, we remain conservative in our reserving practices, especially in regard to our longer-tail product classes. We also continue to increase reserve margins on new business to buffer against uncertainty around longer-term loss trends. \n Finally, I'll share a few thoughts on the current pricing environment and overall insurance market dynamics. In general, we continue to see ongoing modest rate increases across our diversified product portfolio. Property continues to see meaningful rate increases, although at a more moderate level than a year ago. In our casualty lines, we are achieving high single-digit, in some cases, low double-digit rate increases across most of our product classes. Rates remain in line or better than our view on loss trends. \n We've seen a mild softening of rate increases throughout a large part of our international portfolio. Our international book continues to be priced attractively compared to loss trends and combined ratio targets. As such, we continue to actively grow in many of these lines. \n Finally, within professional lines, we see ongoing rate decreases in many classes, most notably in public D&O. As a consequence, we decreased writings in these classes. \n In closing, I want to reiterate we finished the quarter largely where we expected. We recognize that it takes time for actions to earn through and create credibility. However, with our refreshed leadership team and renewed focus, I believe it is only a matter of time before we begin reporting results more in line with our longer-term aspirations. \n Thank you. With that, I'll turn things back over to Tom for questions. \nThomas Gayner: Super. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Brian. \n And Sarah, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. \nMark Hughes: Wonder if you could make any observations about the loss developments. Some of those problematic lines, I think the GL, professional liability, there's been a little more volatility around that. You saw that in your results last year. And clearly, you switched back to kind of your more historical norm of good reserve development. But you highlighted that was -- sounds like it was international in the marine and energy. But anything you're seeing in that loss development, again, the GL, professional liability that is better, worse or about the same as what you saw last year? \nThomas Gayner: Thank you, Jeremy, would you handle Mark's question, please? \nJeremy Noble: Of course. Thanks, Mark. So a couple of things. You're exactly right. We spoke about that a quarter ago. We did a very extensive review in the fourth quarter. We would have reviewed in excess of $4 billion of reserves within our general liability and professional liability portfolios in the U.S., and we took action at that time. \n In the first quarter, our -- there was very little movement or activity in those areas. Certainly, nothing that was unexpected, unanticipated or any concern. By and large, in our insurance, the prior year -- the favorable prior year development was more weighted towards our international book, and that was more weighted towards some of our professional lines in that space. \n With regards to sort of general liability in the U.S. as an example, we would have seen modest favorable prior year activity in the first quarter this year versus modest unfavorable activity in the first quarter of last year. So it's been pretty quiet on that front. Overall, general liability, marine and energy, professional lines in the international space are the largest contributors to our favorable prior year development in the first quarter. \nMark Hughes: And you had mentioned how in casualty, you're seeing high single, maybe low double digits in line or better than loss trends. There's been some discussion of whether those casualty lines were firming, whether pricing was accelerating in early 2024. Are you seeing that? Or is it steady or down? \nJeremy Noble: Yes. We've certainly seen a pretty favorable pricing environment within the casualty lines. And if anything, I would say that that's accelerated over the course of the first quarter. And I think that's wholly appropriate and necessary. I did comment on the fact that our rate that we're seeing is in excess of our estimates around loss trends, which we would hope would be beneficial longer term. That being said, we're certainly being cautious and trying to build a margin of safety into our current accident year attritional selections within the GL space. The rate is pretty clear what we're getting. The trend is more of an assumption. So we want to make sure we have an appropriate margin of safety around that, given the backdrop of the last couple of years. \nMark Hughes: And have you noticed anything between the admitted and E&S? Are those -- is there still business shifting out of admitted into E&S? Is it more stable? Any observations there would be helpful. \nJeremy Noble: Yes. I think the E&S market is still incredibly strong. And certainly, we have a long-standing history and a very sizable presence within the E&S space. We've got a wide portfolio of products that we're focused on delivering through to the E&S space. And I think those trends will continue. \n Certainly, a lot of what we're doing in the casualty space is oriented around and focused on our product offerings within the E&S space. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Andersen with Jefferies. \nAndrew Andersen: Maybe back on reserves. Just given a couple of years of adverse development on GL and professional liability, I think you had also mentioned you're releasing from some recent accident years. So can you kind of talk about these releases here and perhaps why you didn't let them season a little bit longer given the longer tail? \nThomas Gayner: Jeremy, if you'd be so kind? \nJeremy Noble: Yes, of course. Yes, maybe we would take that off-line, Andrew. I don't believe I would say there are longer tail lines of business, general liability and professional liability, particularly in the U.S. that we've done any real releasing on those core reserves on the most recent accident years. \n There could be occasions in other product classes where we might see favorable takedowns on more recent accident years. But I don't think there's anything that's standing out as far as that trend. I would say we're more -- in the most recent years, we're a more wait-and-see mode. And actually, we commented a quarter ago, that part of the reserving actions we took in the fourth quarter was to increase our reserve positions and that margin of safety on those years, on the more recent years. So we're sort of in a wait-and-see mode, I would say, on that. \nAndrew Andersen: Okay. So perhaps the recent accident year commentary was specific to international development? \nJeremy Noble: Yes, sorry. That's the other thing I would say. That's a great point, Andrew, is that, that can be a little bit different in international. And international, as an example, take our professional space, we have a very meaningful professional lines portfolio there. Again, broad product set offering, but that predominantly focuses on international professional lines, not U.S. professional lines that get placed in the London market. We don't do a lot of the U.S. business out of London. \nAndrew Andersen: Okay. And then you had also mentioned that lines exited represented less than 2% on an annual basis. Kind of where are we in the cutting business phase? Is that largely over? Or is it an ongoing process throughout the year? \nJeremy Noble: It's not that frequent that we fully exit a class of business. We're always going to be focused on overall profitability. We obviously have a broad and wide product set at any point in time. Lots of products are going really well, some things that we're working on. \n As far as product exits go, I don't anticipate anything else in the foreseeable future. There's nothing else that we're sort of taking a hard look at. We really acted decisively around those, and we took the action in those instances where we didn't feel like the product was as core to our overall offering, and we didn't think we could address the profitability within that product space in a meaningful time. \n Our work now is largely focused on improving the overall profitability on a handful of lines that we feel like are either not as rate adequate as they need to be, or aren't delivering the overall profitability profile we want. And that's a little bit what I talked about in my comments and obviously from a quarter ago. But I wouldn't expect further product exits. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charlie Lederer with Citi. \nCharles Lederer: Jeremy, you mentioned the 95% combined is above target, but in line with expectations, I guess. Wondering if you can unpack that a little bit. Are you holding more IBNR here in the first quarter to reflect uncertainty? Or any color there that, I guess, should we expect that to improve as the year progresses? \nThomas Gayner: Yes, Jeremy, go ahead, please? \nJeremy Noble: Yes. Of course. Thanks, Charlie. Yes, I would expect that, that would improve over the course of the year. I'm not going to put any specifics around that or any guidance around that. But what I would say, as you know, is we've taken a lot of actions. It takes a while for that to earn through the book. So where we've exited unprofitable products and products that really disproportionately contributed to some of the underwriting loss reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. And where we're taking underwriting actions to improve the profitability profile of ongoing lines, it takes a little while to give credibility to the actions that we've taken, and it takes a little while for that earnings to come through. \n And then also to your point, we are carrying more of a margin of safety within our reserve selections. As I mentioned before, we can be pretty clear on some of the actions that we're taking, and we can be pretty clear about the pricing environment. Overall, what the actual end-of-day inflationary environment, trend environment that we're going to experience is a little bit uncertain. So we're going to be cautious in that space. \n But I think over the course of the year, on a like-for-like basis, barring something that's unforeseen, we should continue to see the result improve as we earn through the effect of the actions we've taken. \nCharles Lederer: Got it. That's helpful. I guess just within the current accident year picks either in Insurance or Reinsurance, did you guys have any exposure to the bridge collapse in Baltimore? \nThomas Gayner: As Jeremy and I were joking, anything you see on TV from around the world, we probably have some of. We have a global book of business all around the world. So when you see disasters happen on TV, you can count that we probably have some of that. But that is the business we are in, and that's how we backstop our customers and take care of them in times of need, but that's normal course of business for us. \n I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeremy? \nJeremy Noble: The only thing I would add to that is -- which really is complementary to what you just shared, Tom, is there's nothing that's unusual or outsized about that event for us, which is why we don't call that out separately. It is a significant event, obviously, for the industry and there'll be sort of ripple effects over time as we assess liability and we evaluate contingent exposures and those sorts of things. But nothing that we would point to that's unusual or outsized. \nCharles Lederer: Okay. So we shouldn't really think about that as being kind of a meaningful contributor to the attritional loss ratio increase year-over-year. It's more just a higher loss pick? \nJeremy Noble: I think what Tom said, large losses are happening all over the world all the time across a broad set of products and classes. We're obviously more acutely aware of the significance of that event than we might be in the U.S. around loss events occurring elsewhere around the world. But whatever might be happening, there's a chance that we're going to have exposure in our portfolio. So I think that's true for us. I think that's true for most of the global players. We don't tend to call out every single individual loss event to try to carve that out from our underlying results. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles Gold with Truist. \nCharles Lee Gold: Congratulations to the three of you and the whole Markel team for the performance you just posted. And Tom, I wanted to follow up on a comment that you made about shares outstanding after the quarter end being below 13 million. Is that from the number in the Q, $13,137 million? Or is there another number that was the starting point for that comment? \nThomas Gayner: No. It would be reflective of the fact that we were darn close to 13 million as of March 31, and we have purchased shares between the time of March 31 and May 2 where we stand right now. \nCharles Lee Gold: Right. That's why. Well, I was asking what number was it at the end of March? Do you have a... \nThomas Gayner: Yes. It was 13.0-something. Brian might have the exact number there. Yes. \nBrian Costanzo: Yes. The 13.1 million that you quoted, that was the number at the end of March, yes. And to Tom's point, yes, the comment was the subsequent purchases post the number in the Q, which would be the March 31 number, have dropped below. \nCharles Lee Gold: Right. And Tom, I would enjoy building out some of those tunes with you at the Reunion, if you'd just get me some of the lyrics. It would make a hell of a party songs. \nThomas Gayner: Well, that's right. Well, you got yourself a deal. \nCharles Lee Gold: All right. Appreciate it. \nThomas Gayner: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Fox with Fenimore. \nJohn Fox: So I'm curious in the other Insurance operations. Looks like there was a $17 million reserve increase. And I think I remember from reading the Q last night that it was an asbestos and environmental, which we haven't heard from in a long time. And I recall, you used to review that in your third quarter. So maybe Jeremy could comment on what's going on there. Is that a one-off or what's happening? \nThomas Gayner: Jeremy, could you give the details on that? \nJeremy Noble: Yes, of course. John, you're exactly right. And your memory is very sound with regards to how we used to approach our annual reserving. So in the other discontinued segment, we did recognize about $15 million of strengthening associated with ongoing claims handling costs for really a large outstanding remaining APH or asbestos or environmental exposure. That hasn't moved in some time. We regularly review that. We would look at that, in some ways, more frequently than annual. \n We don't have as much of an outstanding pot of reserves in as many ways that we're monitoring. So we don't have that annual study the way that we used to. We just review that over time. Nothing -- I would not expect any more in that space anytime soon. We just tried to put that behind us. \nJohn Fox: Okay. Great. Then Tom, I have a bigger picture question. It was interesting with the change in the proxy this year moving from book value to operating income. And my sense is there's a lot of shareholders in Markel that think about 10, 20 years ago when your primarily insurance and book value was a good way to look at the company. But you're really signaling a change going to operating income. And could you talk about how you think about how Markel is a better, stronger company, right? Being more diversified than just especially insurance? And perhaps if my observations are not correct, please correct me. \nThomas Gayner: No, I think your observations are spot on. Yes, you go back 10, 20 years ago when the business was dominated by the Insurance engine, and we didn't even call it that then because that would have implied that perhaps there were other engines, which they were not. And book value is a pretty darn good proxy for describing economic progress of an insurance operation, a bank, a financial institution like that. \n As we have emphasized investments, and we've emphasized that for a long time and the growth of the Ventures businesses, the economic value being created by those businesses doesn't get well reflected in book value. So they do make money. They are worth something. And we think the operating income line that we give you over multiple full years and with the multiyear horizon, that is sort of a separate component of the overall value. \n Now that's sort of accounting presentation and trying to pencil out what it's worth. To the meta point of the Markel Group being a more resilient and robust company, I like the idea of 3 distinct streams of income that are flowing into the coffers. And in any given period, one of those engines might not be fired, 2 of those engines might not be fired. But usually, at least one is. In the first quarter was a case where all 3 were. So it makes things more robust, more resilient, more able to absorb volatility in any one line of business. \n And in fact, I think one of our major competitive advantages is that throughout the entire Markel organization, when we're faced with a business decision, oftentimes, it's pretty clear that there are things which might cost you something in the short term, but it's better for the long term. Now if you're under pressure to pay a short-term bill or meeting a short-term quarterly estimate, the temptation to take the short-term decision exists. We try everything we can possibly do to not have that temptation. We want to do things that are in the right long-term interest of the Markel Group, our shareholders, our customers, our associates. And we've just taken away a lot of the noise. And I think it's a beautiful piece of architecture that underpins what we've been trying to do for a long time. \n And it's nice to get to a quarter like this where you see all 3 engines firing, and it's clear. \nJohn Fox: Right. I just have a suggestion on the presentation. I think Brian referenced like a 5-year cumulative investment gain or something. Maybe you could put the 5-year cumulative on your releases. Because 1 quarter of investment gain, which was nice to make $1 billion last quarter, but a lot of -- some of that's already gone in the month of April in stocks and bonds. So thinking about that and showing it out of 5-year and what the cumulatives are might help communicate that. So that's the suggestion. \nThomas Gayner: All right. Good stuff. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. \nScott Heleniak: You mentioned the rate increases picking up in casualty. Just wondering, are you seeing that across the board? Is there any lines where it kind of sticks out and it's perked up a lot more relative to the past few quarters? \n And then just the second part is any sense on where just generally a loss cost trend is in casualty? I know it's tough to do by -- given your product set, but anything you can share on either one of those? \nThomas Gayner: Jeremy, if you'd be so kind to address that? \nJeremy Noble: Yes, sure. Sure, Scott. I would say that the biggest pockets of our overall casualty portfolio, the ones that we're working on most focused on and the ones that probably heard my comments around rate are really going to be in the primary casualty and excess and umbrella space, within the U.S. and that would contrast from -- and also our larger risk-managed excess casualty offerings, both in the U.S. and Bermuda. \n I would contrast that a little bit with let's say what's happening in the pricing environment for say, our binding lines or other sort of casualty offerings, be it in the sort of health care space or the environmental space where the rates wouldn't be quite as strong as what I commented on. So but across the portfolio, that's the case. \n As far as loss trends go, I said high single digits to low double digits for rate. And I would tell you it's -- loss cost trends are a few points below that. \nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's definitely helpful. And then just switching to Reinsurance. I know you've been kind of remixing that business for a while and doing non-renewals, just kind of getting that book to where you want it to be. Do you feel like it's pretty close to that point and maybe you could see some growth later in 2024 and 2025? Just anything you can share there on just the Reinsurance side? \nJeremy Noble: Sure, Scott. So I mean, overall, you're exactly right. We've been working really hard. We have been remixing the portfolio, taking a lot of actions over the last several years. I'm pretty pleased with our position within Reinsurance. And I think the market conditions are pretty favorable at the moment in the current trading environment overall. \n We have walked away from renewals where the pricing wasn't at levels we wanted to support. So I know that the team is acting with discipline. And we're certainly being prepared to push and to be exacting around pricing in terms of conditions and structures. So we need to continue to see a favorable trading environment within Reinsurance. \n So our overall focus is absolutely on bottom line financial performance and underwriting profitability. But that being said, we certainly had a broad portfolio within the casualty professional and specialty space. We're writing that on a global basis. We're seeing pockets to grow. I think marine and energy is a good example right now in '23 and '24, where we're opportunistically growing. So we're -- and we're exploring other product areas or clients that we can support. \n So we're certainly not at all opposed to growth, but we're also not chasing growth right now. We want to act with a great deal of discipline, and we want to really see that total performance underwriting profitability come through. \n There is really a sort of a contrast between having to address those older accident years, which we talk about, where we've seen some of the reserve development over the last couple of years in Reinsurance, and that current portfolio that you point to that we're feeling pretty good about. \nScott Heleniak: Okay. Okay. Great. And then just lastly, can you share what the new money yield is? I know you mentioned you have higher yields now in money market and some of the fixed income. Can you just talk about what -- give the spread on what the new money is versus existing? And any kind of major shifts that are going on in the investment portfolio at all? \nThomas Gayner: Yes, this is Tom. The new money yields are basically what you can see on your Bloomberg or Yahoo! Finance if you want to go the bargain route. And we are buying treasuries and government securities and the high-high credit quality. So there's really nothing new that happens for us that you don't see on a day-by-day basis. I don't have the numbers with me on what the rolling off on the quarter. But we do have a continuing increment of investment income coming on the books as the time goes by. \nScott Heleniak: Okay. But nothing really new happening on the fixed income side in terms of just the positioning, repositioning it all there, that's pretty steady state? \nThomas Gayner: I can assure you that I've been in Markel 34 years now, and we really don't do anything differently on the fixed income side ever. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Robert Farnam with Janney. \nRobert Farnam: Unfortunately, yet another question for Jeremy on the Insurance operations. Looking at that international professional liability, favorable development. I'm just trying to get a feel for -- it's probably several questions. One, did you do a review of that at year-end? And if so, kind of what changed in the first quarter? But I'd also like to know if there's much differentiation between the International book versus the U.S. book. I'm trying to talk -- are the tails similar? Are their loss trends similar? Or is litigation environment similar? Just trying to get a feel for what that book looked like relative to the U.S.? \nThomas Gayner: Jeremy, if you'd be so kind as to respond? \nJeremy Noble: Yes, of course. So nothing out of the usual or ordinary with regards to our loss reserves in the first quarter. I mean we do a comprehensive loss reserve across our product portfolios in each of our businesses each quarter. We're always looking at actual experience versus expected and seeing whether or not we should make any modifications. As we've sort of said over the years very consistently, we react to bad news very quickly, and we take a very measured approach to the good news. \n What you're seeing in those professional lines in the international is more that latter bucket, where we've sat and been cautious and tried to understand whether or not some of the inflation trends that we would have witnessed within the U.S. on professional lines might come through in the international portfolio, and we've gotten more confident over time as actual experience has been better than what we anticipated or expected in our actuarial models. And when that's the case, we release reserves. So that was -- it's not that all of the favorable prior year takedowns by any stretch was just that line. That's just an example in a more meaningful year-over-year contributor. \n As far as the book differential, I spoke a little bit about this earlier, the biggest difference is our international portfolio is just that. It's risks that are outside the U.S. And as far as are there different risk profiles between U.S. risks and international risks, I would leave it to you to draw your conclusions about legal environment, social inflation trends, litigation financing and what you would see in the rest of the world versus what we would experience in the U.S. Our view is that, that looks a little bit different. And economic inflation, I think trends are a little bit different as well. \n The profile of the client, the insured, the products themselves, there's also some differences there as well between what we do in the U.S. and there. But also, it's the case that even in U.S. and internationally, we have very broad product capabilities, coverage capabilities and customer capabilities, ranging from small businesses all the way to very large Global 1000 risk managed accounts that we would do in U.S. and Bermuda. \n So -- but there's definitely sort of differences. Our international would weigh towards smaller and just that international non-U.S. risk. \nOperator: Your next question is a follow-up from Charlie Lederer with Citi. \nCharles Lederer: So Tom mentioned in the shareholder letter a couple of months ago about the improving earnings trajectory at Nephila as it gets above its high watermark. Wondering if you can update us on the outlook there post 1Q? It doesn't look like we saw the uplift in 1Q. Should we think about that coming soon? Or revenue accelerating there? Any color? \nThomas Gayner: Yes, I'm going to take the first pass at that. And I would like Jeremy and Brian to chime in. Given the nature of Nephila's business, generally speaking, they're going to do their work through the course of the year, and we're not going to put up a lot of accruals for -- until after the year is closed, and you see what their share of profits are. So it'll tend to be reported with a year lag because you got to get into the first quarter of the subsequent year 'til you recognize what happened in the year before. \n So during the first, second and third and -- excuse me, second third, fourth quarters of the year, you're still just showing sort of what happened last year. Not so much what's happening this year. \nJeremy Noble: Yes, Todd, it's Jeremy. I'll just -- I'll add to that, Charlie. There's a couple of things. One, there is -- probably most importantly, within our disclosures, I would just caution you or make the observation that the insurance-linked securities line alone doesn't include all of the economics and contributions from Nephila because within the program services and other fronting line, where you can see there's more revenues as well as a higher margin there, a portion of that is associated with the Nephila's operations as well. That's part of the overall earnings profile of that business. So in fact, the overall results would be better than just what you would see in the ILS line and would be profitable overall. \n The other thing that's really important is there is certainly sort of seasonality. So the first quarter is a low earnings period within the funds because we're less on risk. That increases in the second quarter. The third quarter is the highest earnings. And that is largely correlated with wind season and exposure within the portfolios. \n And then the last point to build off Tom's comment is that idea of the performance management fees are just that. They come in as fees. Once we've performed, by and large, that is going to be measured in the most meaningful way to the extent that it's earned and available kind of at the stroke of midnight at the end of the year. So we don't make any provisions or accruals or assumptions around that until we were to get to the end of the year. We'll be back, I guess, in 3 quarters' time, and we'll tell you how that went. \nCharles Lederer: Got it. That's very helpful. So that's a 4Q or a 4Q dynamic with performance fees? \nJeremy Noble: That would be most significantly a fourth quarter, a full year dynamic. And that's not absolutely the case for all investors across all funds. But by and large, that's what it would be. \nCharles Lederer: Okay. And if I could just ask one more. So Tom started the call, I think by complementing the management team for turning the Insurance business around and the results are much improved. Just curious, given some of the headlines we've seen with certain teams maybe defecting or just some of the changes within the last 6-plus months. Do you feel like you have the pieces in place now to accelerate growth as you lap some of the top line headwinds? Or do you think you need to -- or should we expect you to kind of keep adding? \nThomas Gayner: I think we have a wonderful team on the field. It's a dynamic business. People come and people go, but we have a wonderful roster of long-term committed veterans that have signed up to be part of the Markel Style, the Markel Group, and I feel very good about our people. \n Again, we're not focused on top line growth. We're focused on profitability and creating value for the Markel Group shareholders over time. So we might judge ourselves by a slightly different metric than you would look at or can be easily quantified, but I love our team that's on the field. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Gayner for any closing remarks. \nThomas Gayner: Thank you so much. And again, I'd just reiterate the invitation for you all to join us on May 22 at the Robins Center at the University of Richmond at 2:00 in the afternoon. It's a wonderful time. We would expect more than 2,000 people there. So it's an event that you don't want to miss, and I hope to see so many of you there. \n Thank you all for calling. Bye-bye. \nOperator: The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Costanzo",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Before I dive into the quarter's results, I'll make a few comments on the changes within our earnings release and 10-Q for the quarter. We believe these changes provide a clear picture of our overall performance. \n First, we moved to a consistent measure of profitability of operating income across each segment of our business that excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets. We do not consider these costs when assessing the performance of our businesses and believe it helps investors to provide a consistent performance metric across our operating segments. \n Additionally, as Tom mentioned, we incorporated a longer-term view of our key metrics within our press release to provide more perspective on our performance, consistent with how we evaluate performance for incentive compensation purposes. In any given quarter or year, there are many factors that can create volatility in results, which is why we consistently measure our performance over 5-year periods. We hope you'll find these changes helpful as you review our results. \n With that, let me take you through our consolidated results for the period. Total revenues increased 23% to $4.5 billion with each of our 3 engines achieving year-over-year top line growth, with the most notable growth coming from our Investments engine. Operating income grew by 77% to $1.3 billion during the first quarter, driven largely by an increase in net investment gains in the quarter, highlighting our longer-term view where short-term changes in the valuation of our equity portfolio are more normalized, we have created cumulative operating income of $8.7 billion over the past 4 years plus the first quarter of this year. \n Total net income to common shareholders was $1 billion in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $489 million in the same period of 2023, with the change primarily attributable to higher net investment gains on our public equity portfolio in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. \n Comprehensive income to shareholders in the first quarter of 2024 was $909 million compared to $646 million in the same period of 2023, with the favorable change in the public equity valuations being partially offset by an unfavorable swing in our fixed maturity portfolio. \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $631 million in the first quarter of 2024, compared to $284 million in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in 2024 reflected strong cash flows from each of our operating engines, with the most significant contribution coming from our Insurance engine. \n Total shareholders' equity stood at $15.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. As Tom mentioned, in the first quarter, we repurchased $161 million worth of shares of Markel Group's stock under our outstanding share repurchase program, compared to $82 million in the same period last year. \n With that, I'll now turn to the performance of each of our operating engines, starting off with our Insurance engine. Gross written premiums within our underwriting operations grew 4% to $2.8 billion for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $2.7 billion for the same period last year. Our increased premium volume reflects new business growth and more favorable rates on many lines within our international portfolio and select U.S. lines of business. We are working hard to rebalance our diversified portfolio of products, which has resulted in contracting premium writings in certain classes, particularly within pockets of our U.S. professional liability and general liability portfolios. Jeremy will go into more detail about changes in the mix of business and the impact of our underwriting actions on top line premiums in his comments. \n Our consolidated combined ratio for the first quarter was 95% compared to 94% in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to a higher attritional loss ratio within our U.S. general liability and professional liability product lines within our Insurance segment. \n Prior year loss reserves developed favorably by $77 million this year versus $71 million in the first quarter of 2023. Favorable development in the first quarter this year was most notable within our international professional liability and marine and energy product lines. \n We remain cautious and conservative in our approach to both current year losses and reducing prior year loss reserves on our longer-tail U.S. professional liability and general liability lines, given recent claim trends. Within our program services and ILS operations, operating income increased 33% to $23 million, primarily driven by growth within program services and other fronting. \n Moving next to our Investments results. We reported net investment income of $218 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $159 million in the same period last year. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as the yield on our fixed maturity portfolio, short-term investments and cash equivalents all increased. Additionally, we have been allocating more cash to money market funds and fixed maturity securities to capitalize on the higher interest rate environment. We expect, based on the current interest rates, that the yield on fixed maturity securities will continue to increase slightly throughout 2024 as lower-yielding securities mature and are replaced by higher-yielding securities. \n Net investment gains of $902 million in 2024 reflect favorable market movements, resulting in a return of 9.8% on our public equity portfolio in the first quarter. This compares to net investment gains of $373 million in the first quarter of 2023. \n As you've heard us say often before, and I'm sure you'll hear me say again, we focus on long-term investment performance expecting variability in the equity markets from period to period. At the end of March, the fair value of our equity portfolio included cumulative pretax unrealized gains of $7 billion. \n Net unrealized investment losses and other comprehensive loss in the first quarter of 2024 were $123 million net of taxes compared to net unrealized investment gains of $164 million net of taxes in the same period last year. These movements correspond to changes in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio, resulting from changes in interest rates. \n Recall that we typically hold our fixed maturities until they mature and would generally expect unrealized holding gains and losses attributed to the changes in interest rates to reverse in future periods as bonds mature. \n Additionally, we continue our long-standing precedent of investing in the highest quality of fixed income securities. As of March 31, 2024, 98% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated AA or better, and there are no current or expected credit losses within the portfolio. \n Finally, I'll turn to our results from our Markel Ventures engine. Revenues from Markel Ventures increased 3% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year, reflecting moderate revenue increases at our consumer and building products and construction services businesses. \n Markel Ventures' operating income increased 13% driven by higher revenues and improved operating margins at our consumer and building products businesses versus a year ago. Our Markel Ventures companies continue their excellent long-term performance and meaningful contribution to our operating results and cash flows. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Jeremy to talk more about our Insurance engine. Yes. The 13.1 million that you quoted, that was the number at the end of March, yes. And to Tom's point, yes, the comment was the subsequent purchases post the number in the Q, which would be the March 31 number, have dropped below."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Thomas Gayner",
            "content": "Thank you, Sarah. I appreciate it. Good morning, and welcome to the Markel Group First Quarter Conference Call. This is indeed Tom Gayner, your CEO. I'm joined today by Brian Costanzo, our CFO; and Jeremy Noble, the President of our Insurance operations. \n As always, we look forward to checking in with you about our results. We view our long-term shareholders as partners. We welcome the chance to provide you with an update on how things are going as well as our plans and dreams for the future. We also look forward to answering your thoughtful questions. \n As a quick review of the bidding, at the Markel Group, we are working to build one of the world's great companies. We view a great company as one that operates a win-win-win system. We want our customers to win because they bought products and services from us that served their needs. We want our associates to win by serving our customers, supporting their families and communities, continuously learning and being creative. We want our shareholders to win as we earn profitable results on the capital we use to do this work. That's what win-win-win means to us. \n I'm delighted to report to you that we're off to a good start in doing exactly that so far in 2024. I'm going to channel my inner chasm right now by saying in 1972, Johnny Nash recorded a #1 hit called, \"I can see clearly now the rain is gone\". You have no idea how hard it is for me to just say the title without singing it. In 1993, Jimmy Cliff covered it for the movie, \"Cool Runnings\". Well, covering that song continues. The Markel Group is laying down tracks of another cover so far in 2024, and we'll do our best to work our way through the verses as the year progresses. \n Brian will quantify the notes with numbers in just a minute, but let me speak qualitatively about the music. Here's why that song comes to mind for me. I've got 4 bullet points in mind. Usually, I try to keep the list to 3, but I just can't help myself today. \n Point one: we've got improving results in our insurance engine. Jeremy will provide you with some details in a few minutes. I want to thank him and his team personally for the efforts they have expended in improving our results. I am grateful for their work. Thank you. \n Point two: Our Ventures companies continue to produce excellent results. I want to express my appreciation to the leaders of the Markel Ventures companies and their teams for their accomplishments. \n Point three: we enjoyed excellent returns on our investment operations. Recurring investment income continues to rise rapidly. We're investing our cash flows from operations and maturing bonds into higher-yielding securities. Dividends from our holdings of publicly traded equities also continue to grow. \n Point four: we continue to repurchase our shares. We started to repurchase shares in meaningful quantities in 2022 as we believed the share price traded at a significant discount to our calculation of what we thought a share of Markel was worth. In 2023, we thought that gap widened, so we bought more shares than we did in 2022. In the first quarter of 2024, we thought the gap widened more, so we bought more. In fact, we nearly doubled our purchases in the first quarter to $161 million compared to $82 million a year ago. From roughly 14 million outstanding shares as recently as February 2019, we ended the first quarter with 13 million. And as we speak now, we are below that milestone. Each share of the Markel Group continues to own a greater percentage of our Insurance, Ventures and Investment operations. As a shareholder myself, with the majority of my net worth in Markel stock, that seems like a good thing to me. \n If we continue to earn the sort of returns that we are now and if the marketplace continues to assign a meaningful discount to our shares, at our current rate of repurchases, we'll get the share count down to 1 in a little over 30 years. I suspect the market will catch on before we get to that point. \n Also, in recognition of our commitment to long-term thinking and progress, we updated our press release format to include 5 years of data as well as that of the current quarter. We remain focused on long-term actions and measures, and we hope the new format speaks to that commitment. The format also describes the metrics we use to calculate incentive compensation. We think 5-year measurement periods do a good job of demonstrating our commitment to long-term accomplishments and accountability. We also hope that the report provides clarity as to how we measure progress. \n Finally, I'd like to reiterate our invitation to join us for our upcoming Annual Shareholders' Meeting, which we call \"The Reunion\". We'll be back at the Robins Center at the University of Richmond on May 22, and we'll start at 2:00 p.m. Last year, we had so many people that traffic got clogged. We encourage you to come early. The Annual Meeting is the best setting to enjoy the company of your fellow shareholders, see what condition our condition is in, ask questions of management and meet some of the people of Markel from all around the world. Please make sure you register at www.mklreunion.com so that we can have credentials ready for you to get into the Robins Center quickly. \n I love our team, and I am proud of what they continue to accomplish. I hope you feel the same way, and I look forward to seeing as many of you in person in May as is possible. \n Before I turn it over to Brian, I'll share what I hope to be saying in upcoming periods. As Johnny Nash saying after the first line of \"I can see clearly now\", \"I can see all obstacles in my way. Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind, it's going to be a bright-bright-bright Sun Shiny Day.\" That's what I hope to be saying in future calls. We will do our best to make it so. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Jeremy will follow with his comments and then we'll open up the floor for your questions. Brian? Super. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, Brian. \n And Sarah, if you'd be so kind as to open the floor for questions. Thank you, Jeremy, would you handle Mark's question, please? Jeremy, if you'd be so kind? Yes, Jeremy, go ahead, please? As Jeremy and I were joking, anything you see on TV from around the world, we probably have some of. We have a global book of business all around the world. So when you see disasters happen on TV, you can count that we probably have some of that. But that is the business we are in, and that's how we backstop our customers and take care of them in times of need, but that's normal course of business for us. \n I don't know if you want to add anything, Jeremy? No. It would be reflective of the fact that we were darn close to 13 million as of March 31, and we have purchased shares between the time of March 31 and May 2 where we stand right now. Yes. It was 13.0-something. Brian might have the exact number there. Yes. Well, that's right. Well, you got yourself a deal. Thank you. Jeremy, could you give the details on that? No, I think your observations are spot on. Yes, you go back 10, 20 years ago when the business was dominated by the Insurance engine, and we didn't even call it that then because that would have implied that perhaps there were other engines, which they were not. And book value is a pretty darn good proxy for describing economic progress of an insurance operation, a bank, a financial institution like that. \n As we have emphasized investments, and we've emphasized that for a long time and the growth of the Ventures businesses, the economic value being created by those businesses doesn't get well reflected in book value. So they do make money. They are worth something. And we think the operating income line that we give you over multiple full years and with the multiyear horizon, that is sort of a separate component of the overall value. \n Now that's sort of accounting presentation and trying to pencil out what it's worth. To the meta point of the Markel Group being a more resilient and robust company, I like the idea of 3 distinct streams of income that are flowing into the coffers. And in any given period, one of those engines might not be fired, 2 of those engines might not be fired. But usually, at least one is. In the first quarter was a case where all 3 were. So it makes things more robust, more resilient, more able to absorb volatility in any one line of business. \n And in fact, I think one of our major competitive advantages is that throughout the entire Markel organization, when we're faced with a business decision, oftentimes, it's pretty clear that there are things which might cost you something in the short term, but it's better for the long term. Now if you're under pressure to pay a short-term bill or meeting a short-term quarterly estimate, the temptation to take the short-term decision exists. We try everything we can possibly do to not have that temptation. We want to do things that are in the right long-term interest of the Markel Group, our shareholders, our customers, our associates. And we've just taken away a lot of the noise. And I think it's a beautiful piece of architecture that underpins what we've been trying to do for a long time. \n And it's nice to get to a quarter like this where you see all 3 engines firing, and it's clear. All right. Good stuff. Jeremy, if you'd be so kind to address that? Yes, this is Tom. The new money yields are basically what you can see on your Bloomberg or Yahoo! Finance if you want to go the bargain route. And we are buying treasuries and government securities and the high-high credit quality. So there's really nothing new that happens for us that you don't see on a day-by-day basis. I don't have the numbers with me on what the rolling off on the quarter. But we do have a continuing increment of investment income coming on the books as the time goes by. I can assure you that I've been in Markel 34 years now, and we really don't do anything differently on the fixed income side ever. Jeremy, if you'd be so kind as to respond? Yes, I'm going to take the first pass at that. And I would like Jeremy and Brian to chime in. Given the nature of Nephila's business, generally speaking, they're going to do their work through the course of the year, and we're not going to put up a lot of accruals for -- until after the year is closed, and you see what their share of profits are. So it'll tend to be reported with a year lag because you got to get into the first quarter of the subsequent year 'til you recognize what happened in the year before. \n So during the first, second and third and -- excuse me, second third, fourth quarters of the year, you're still just showing sort of what happened last year. Not so much what's happening this year. I think we have a wonderful team on the field. It's a dynamic business. People come and people go, but we have a wonderful roster of long-term committed veterans that have signed up to be part of the Markel Style, the Markel Group, and I feel very good about our people. \n Again, we're not focused on top line growth. We're focused on profitability and creating value for the Markel Group shareholders over time. So we might judge ourselves by a slightly different metric than you would look at or can be easily quantified, but I love our team that's on the field. Thank you so much. And again, I'd just reiterate the invitation for you all to join us on May 22 at the Robins Center at the University of Richmond at 2:00 in the afternoon. It's a wonderful time. We would expect more than 2,000 people there. So it's an event that you don't want to miss, and I hope to see so many of you there. \n Thank you all for calling. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Jeremy Noble",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning. As you heard from Tom and Brian, the actions we took from the start of the year to improve the overall health of our insurance operations are beginning to bear fruit. We spent much of the first quarter implementing the significant corrective underwriting actions that I discussed on our earnings call a quarter ago, which I believe will improve future profitability. These steps addressed where we recently underperformed, particularly within our U.S. specialty insurance operations. At the same time, we work to meaningfully grow in the products, geographic territories and industries where performance meets or exceeds our long-term profitability targets. \n For the first quarter of 2024, our combined ratio was 95%. That result exceeds our ultimate goal, but is in line with where we expected to be at this point in the year. It also shows meaningful improvement from where we stood in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023. \n The impact of our portfolio management actions are most evident in our gross written premium volume for the first quarter. On the surface, we grew a modest 4% versus a year ago. However, you need to disaggregate that growth a bit to appreciate the effectiveness of our underwriting actions. \n We use portfolio management tools each quarter to monitor portfolio health and rate adequacy and to evaluate the profitability of each of our products. You might think of this like a traffic light system, where we assign a color of green, yellow or red to each product line. Those colors show the degree of rate adequacy and associated combined ratio deviation for market profitability target for each product. I'll use this construct to demonstrate how we are remixing the portfolio towards our most profitable lines. \n Within our green product classes, which represent products that are significantly outperforming our combined ratio targets, our premiums grew by 14% during the first quarter. Around 40% of our overall gross written premiums fall into this category at the moment. \n On the flip side, our red product classes where profitability is underperforming our combined ratio targets, gross premium volume decreased by 16% during the first quarter. At present, a little more than 10% of our portfolio falls in this category, which is actively being managed. \n Let me be clear, for many of these lines, we are still operating in an underwriting profit, but at a combined ratio that is above our target. For each product, we have a robust set of underwriting action plans to get us back to an acceptable level of profitability in a reasonable period of time, and our plans take into consideration current market dynamics and long-standing relationships. \n This contraction in the first quarter of '24, focused on several product classes within our U.S. and Bermuda casualty and professional liability portfolio. These underwriting actions were most notable in our brokerage excess and umbrella and brokerage primary contractors general liability lines within casualty. And our large account risk managed errors and omissions and directors' and officers' lines within professional liability. \n Our underwriting actions consist of a mixture of rate increases, changes to terms and conditions, evaluation of limited attachment points and redistribution of geographical or industry mix. We also decreased the overall proportion of construction business within our casualty portfolio and improved the profitability outlook for our existing book. \n In certain instances, we identified product lines that were not expected to be profitable. In these circumstances, we made more meaningful changes, including exiting certain products or subclasses. We discontinued writing several product classes in our Insurance segment in the first quarter, where we believe underwriting action plans would not enable us to reach our profitability goals. Some of the areas we exited included retail primary casualty, risk-managed architects and engineers and intellectual property collateral protection lines. \n In total, the lines and subclasses we exited represented less than 2% of our Insurance segment operations on an annual basis. \n We also non-renewed a handful of professional liability quota share contracts within our Reinsurance segment that did not meet our pricing targets. \n Overall, we remain thoughtful and disciplined about how we handle long-term portfolio management. \n Turning to the positive. We've seen profitable growth within our U.S. specialty insurance operations within our property and inland marine, personal lines, programs, binding and commercial professional liability products. Within our international portfolio, we've seen profitable growth across a number of products, including our marine and energy, U.K. and European businesses. \n Within our Global Reinsurance operations, we opportunistically pursued growth within the London market specialty marine and energy space. With a large, well-diversified global platform, we see plenty of opportunities to grow and enhance our overall portfolio construction. We are focused on doing just that. \n We've taken strong and decisive actions to deliver improved combined ratio results going forward. It will take time for these underwriting actions to earn through and impact our combined ratio, but we're confident that we're on the right track. \n Meanwhile, we remain conservative in our reserving practices, especially in regard to our longer-tail product classes. We also continue to increase reserve margins on new business to buffer against uncertainty around longer-term loss trends. \n Finally, I'll share a few thoughts on the current pricing environment and overall insurance market dynamics. In general, we continue to see ongoing modest rate increases across our diversified product portfolio. Property continues to see meaningful rate increases, although at a more moderate level than a year ago. In our casualty lines, we are achieving high single-digit, in some cases, low double-digit rate increases across most of our product classes. Rates remain in line or better than our view on loss trends. \n We've seen a mild softening of rate increases throughout a large part of our international portfolio. Our international book continues to be priced attractively compared to loss trends and combined ratio targets. As such, we continue to actively grow in many of these lines. \n Finally, within professional lines, we see ongoing rate decreases in many classes, most notably in public D&O. As a consequence, we decreased writings in these classes. \n In closing, I want to reiterate we finished the quarter largely where we expected. We recognize that it takes time for actions to earn through and create credibility. However, with our refreshed leadership team and renewed focus, I believe it is only a matter of time before we begin reporting results more in line with our longer-term aspirations. \n Thank you. With that, I'll turn things back over to Tom for questions. Of course. Thanks, Mark. So a couple of things. You're exactly right. We spoke about that a quarter ago. We did a very extensive review in the fourth quarter. We would have reviewed in excess of $4 billion of reserves within our general liability and professional liability portfolios in the U.S., and we took action at that time. \n In the first quarter, our -- there was very little movement or activity in those areas. Certainly, nothing that was unexpected, unanticipated or any concern. By and large, in our insurance, the prior year -- the favorable prior year development was more weighted towards our international book, and that was more weighted towards some of our professional lines in that space. \n With regards to sort of general liability in the U.S. as an example, we would have seen modest favorable prior year activity in the first quarter this year versus modest unfavorable activity in the first quarter of last year. So it's been pretty quiet on that front. Overall, general liability, marine and energy, professional lines in the international space are the largest contributors to our favorable prior year development in the first quarter. Yes. We've certainly seen a pretty favorable pricing environment within the casualty lines. And if anything, I would say that that's accelerated over the course of the first quarter. And I think that's wholly appropriate and necessary. I did comment on the fact that our rate that we're seeing is in excess of our estimates around loss trends, which we would hope would be beneficial longer term. That being said, we're certainly being cautious and trying to build a margin of safety into our current accident year attritional selections within the GL space. The rate is pretty clear what we're getting. The trend is more of an assumption. So we want to make sure we have an appropriate margin of safety around that, given the backdrop of the last couple of years. Yes. I think the E&S market is still incredibly strong. And certainly, we have a long-standing history and a very sizable presence within the E&S space. We've got a wide portfolio of products that we're focused on delivering through to the E&S space. And I think those trends will continue. \n Certainly, a lot of what we're doing in the casualty space is oriented around and focused on our product offerings within the E&S space. Yes, of course. Yes, maybe we would take that off-line, Andrew. I don't believe I would say there are longer tail lines of business, general liability and professional liability, particularly in the U.S. that we've done any real releasing on those core reserves on the most recent accident years. \n There could be occasions in other product classes where we might see favorable takedowns on more recent accident years. But I don't think there's anything that's standing out as far as that trend. I would say we're more -- in the most recent years, we're a more wait-and-see mode. And actually, we commented a quarter ago, that part of the reserving actions we took in the fourth quarter was to increase our reserve positions and that margin of safety on those years, on the more recent years. So we're sort of in a wait-and-see mode, I would say, on that. Yes, sorry. That's the other thing I would say. That's a great point, Andrew, is that, that can be a little bit different in international. And international, as an example, take our professional space, we have a very meaningful professional lines portfolio there. Again, broad product set offering, but that predominantly focuses on international professional lines, not U.S. professional lines that get placed in the London market. We don't do a lot of the U.S. business out of London. It's not that frequent that we fully exit a class of business. We're always going to be focused on overall profitability. We obviously have a broad and wide product set at any point in time. Lots of products are going really well, some things that we're working on. \n As far as product exits go, I don't anticipate anything else in the foreseeable future. There's nothing else that we're sort of taking a hard look at. We really acted decisively around those, and we took the action in those instances where we didn't feel like the product was as core to our overall offering, and we didn't think we could address the profitability within that product space in a meaningful time. \n Our work now is largely focused on improving the overall profitability on a handful of lines that we feel like are either not as rate adequate as they need to be, or aren't delivering the overall profitability profile we want. And that's a little bit what I talked about in my comments and obviously from a quarter ago. But I wouldn't expect further product exits. Yes. Of course. Thanks, Charlie. Yes, I would expect that, that would improve over the course of the year. I'm not going to put any specifics around that or any guidance around that. But what I would say, as you know, is we've taken a lot of actions. It takes a while for that to earn through the book. So where we've exited unprofitable products and products that really disproportionately contributed to some of the underwriting loss reported in the fourth quarter a year ago. And where we're taking underwriting actions to improve the profitability profile of ongoing lines, it takes a little while to give credibility to the actions that we've taken, and it takes a little while for that earnings to come through. \n And then also to your point, we are carrying more of a margin of safety within our reserve selections. As I mentioned before, we can be pretty clear on some of the actions that we're taking, and we can be pretty clear about the pricing environment. Overall, what the actual end-of-day inflationary environment, trend environment that we're going to experience is a little bit uncertain. So we're going to be cautious in that space. \n But I think over the course of the year, on a like-for-like basis, barring something that's unforeseen, we should continue to see the result improve as we earn through the effect of the actions we've taken. The only thing I would add to that is -- which really is complementary to what you just shared, Tom, is there's nothing that's unusual or outsized about that event for us, which is why we don't call that out separately. It is a significant event, obviously, for the industry and there'll be sort of ripple effects over time as we assess liability and we evaluate contingent exposures and those sorts of things. But nothing that we would point to that's unusual or outsized. I think what Tom said, large losses are happening all over the world all the time across a broad set of products and classes. We're obviously more acutely aware of the significance of that event than we might be in the U.S. around loss events occurring elsewhere around the world. But whatever might be happening, there's a chance that we're going to have exposure in our portfolio. So I think that's true for us. I think that's true for most of the global players. We don't tend to call out every single individual loss event to try to carve that out from our underlying results. Yes, of course. John, you're exactly right. And your memory is very sound with regards to how we used to approach our annual reserving. So in the other discontinued segment, we did recognize about $15 million of strengthening associated with ongoing claims handling costs for really a large outstanding remaining APH or asbestos or environmental exposure. That hasn't moved in some time. We regularly review that. We would look at that, in some ways, more frequently than annual. \n We don't have as much of an outstanding pot of reserves in as many ways that we're monitoring. So we don't have that annual study the way that we used to. We just review that over time. Nothing -- I would not expect any more in that space anytime soon. We just tried to put that behind us. Yes, sure. Sure, Scott. I would say that the biggest pockets of our overall casualty portfolio, the ones that we're working on most focused on and the ones that probably heard my comments around rate are really going to be in the primary casualty and excess and umbrella space, within the U.S. and that would contrast from -- and also our larger risk-managed excess casualty offerings, both in the U.S. and Bermuda. \n I would contrast that a little bit with let's say what's happening in the pricing environment for say, our binding lines or other sort of casualty offerings, be it in the sort of health care space or the environmental space where the rates wouldn't be quite as strong as what I commented on. So but across the portfolio, that's the case. \n As far as loss trends go, I said high single digits to low double digits for rate. And I would tell you it's -- loss cost trends are a few points below that. Sure, Scott. So I mean, overall, you're exactly right. We've been working really hard. We have been remixing the portfolio, taking a lot of actions over the last several years. I'm pretty pleased with our position within Reinsurance. And I think the market conditions are pretty favorable at the moment in the current trading environment overall. \n We have walked away from renewals where the pricing wasn't at levels we wanted to support. So I know that the team is acting with discipline. And we're certainly being prepared to push and to be exacting around pricing in terms of conditions and structures. So we need to continue to see a favorable trading environment within Reinsurance. \n So our overall focus is absolutely on bottom line financial performance and underwriting profitability. But that being said, we certainly had a broad portfolio within the casualty professional and specialty space. We're writing that on a global basis. We're seeing pockets to grow. I think marine and energy is a good example right now in '23 and '24, where we're opportunistically growing. So we're -- and we're exploring other product areas or clients that we can support. \n So we're certainly not at all opposed to growth, but we're also not chasing growth right now. We want to act with a great deal of discipline, and we want to really see that total performance underwriting profitability come through. \n There is really a sort of a contrast between having to address those older accident years, which we talk about, where we've seen some of the reserve development over the last couple of years in Reinsurance, and that current portfolio that you point to that we're feeling pretty good about. Yes, of course. So nothing out of the usual or ordinary with regards to our loss reserves in the first quarter. I mean we do a comprehensive loss reserve across our product portfolios in each of our businesses each quarter. We're always looking at actual experience versus expected and seeing whether or not we should make any modifications. As we've sort of said over the years very consistently, we react to bad news very quickly, and we take a very measured approach to the good news. \n What you're seeing in those professional lines in the international is more that latter bucket, where we've sat and been cautious and tried to understand whether or not some of the inflation trends that we would have witnessed within the U.S. on professional lines might come through in the international portfolio, and we've gotten more confident over time as actual experience has been better than what we anticipated or expected in our actuarial models. And when that's the case, we release reserves. So that was -- it's not that all of the favorable prior year takedowns by any stretch was just that line. That's just an example in a more meaningful year-over-year contributor. \n As far as the book differential, I spoke a little bit about this earlier, the biggest difference is our international portfolio is just that. It's risks that are outside the U.S. And as far as are there different risk profiles between U.S. risks and international risks, I would leave it to you to draw your conclusions about legal environment, social inflation trends, litigation financing and what you would see in the rest of the world versus what we would experience in the U.S. Our view is that, that looks a little bit different. And economic inflation, I think trends are a little bit different as well. \n The profile of the client, the insured, the products themselves, there's also some differences there as well between what we do in the U.S. and there. But also, it's the case that even in U.S. and internationally, we have very broad product capabilities, coverage capabilities and customer capabilities, ranging from small businesses all the way to very large Global 1000 risk managed accounts that we would do in U.S. and Bermuda. \n So -- but there's definitely sort of differences. Our international would weigh towards smaller and just that international non-U.S. risk. Yes, Todd, it's Jeremy. I'll just -- I'll add to that, Charlie. There's a couple of things. One, there is -- probably most importantly, within our disclosures, I would just caution you or make the observation that the insurance-linked securities line alone doesn't include all of the economics and contributions from Nephila because within the program services and other fronting line, where you can see there's more revenues as well as a higher margin there, a portion of that is associated with the Nephila's operations as well. That's part of the overall earnings profile of that business. So in fact, the overall results would be better than just what you would see in the ILS line and would be profitable overall. \n The other thing that's really important is there is certainly sort of seasonality. So the first quarter is a low earnings period within the funds because we're less on risk. That increases in the second quarter. The third quarter is the highest earnings. And that is largely correlated with wind season and exposure within the portfolios. \n And then the last point to build off Tom's comment is that idea of the performance management fees are just that. They come in as fees. Once we've performed, by and large, that is going to be measured in the most meaningful way to the extent that it's earned and available kind of at the stroke of midnight at the end of the year. So we don't make any provisions or accruals or assumptions around that until we were to get to the end of the year. We'll be back, I guess, in 3 quarters' time, and we'll tell you how that went. That would be most significantly a fourth quarter, a full year dynamic. And that's not absolutely the case for all investors across all funds. But by and large, that's what it would be."
