[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to Andrew Palmer, the company's Head of Investor Relations.\nAndrew Palmer: Good morning. On the line with me today are Joe Jolson, JMP Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ray Jackson, the company's Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Lehmann, CEO of JMP Securities. Before we begin, please note that some of this morning's comments may contain forward-looking statements about future events that are out of JMP's control. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied. For a discussion of the uncertainties that could affect the company's future performance, please review the risk factors detailed in our most recent 10-K. With that, I'll turn things over to JMP's Chairman and CEO, Joe Jolson.\nJoe Jolson: Thanks, Andrew. This is our first earnings call in 1.5 years. We paused these calls mid-2019 as we started thinking through some strategic changes for the company. Much of that work is now behind us, and we felt it was time to discuss the results of our efforts. One of the key changes since our last conference call was the elevation of Mark Lehmann to the role of CEO of JMP Securities. That occurred this past summer, when we also named Tom Wright Chief Operating Officer of JMP Securities and made Jon Dever and Gavin Slader, co-heads of our Investment Banking Group and members of our Executive Committee. In addition, we have simplified our balance sheet, shedding noncore businesses such as Harvest Capital Credit Corp., resulting in a simpler story to tell and a simpler company to run once that deal closes in the second quarter. We'll continue to look to monetize our corporate investments and work aggressively to pay down long-term debt after just redeeming $10 million of our senior notes 2 weeks ago, leaving us with roughly $71 million of long-term debt outstanding. In 2020, the wind was at our back. It was an unprecedented and challenging year in many respects. But amazingly, we ended the year with record results. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $53.6 million, up 125% from the $23.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, net revenues were $115.5 million versus $100 million for 2019. Operating earnings per share were $0.42 for the fourth quarter, by far, a record, and $0.63 for the year, also a record for the firm. I'll ask Mark to add some thoughts about JMP Securities before I finish up. Mark?\nMark Lehmann: Thanks, Joe. JMP Securities is one of the few remaining independent equity capital markets platforms of meaningful scale in the United States. That said, we are firm believers in the full-service model, which pairs capital markets expertise with our strategic advisory capabilities. We've completed -- I'm sorry, competed successfully to establish JMP as a more recognizable brand in the middle market and a more sought-after strategic advisory partner to growth companies.  In 2020, we had our best year ever. Total revenues of nearly $119 million and a record operating profit of $0.68 per share. Investment banking revenues hit record levels for December, for the fourth quarter and for the entire year, finishing 2020 at $100 million, up 53% from 2019. 60% of that amount came from public equity and debt capital raising and 40% from strategic advisory and private placements. Capital markets revenues, which combined fees from equity and debt origination with net brokerage revenues were up 32% year-over-year to $79 million for 2020.  Our net brokerage revenues were also up 10% last year to $19 million. We were a lead or co-manager on 1/3 of all U.S. tech IPOs priced last year, compared to just 10% in 2014 and 8% in 2007, the peak years of the 2 prior market cycles. We are gaining market share. At the same time, some of the senior M&A professionals we've hired recently proved to be our biggest producers in 2020, contributing to record advisory fee of $40.5 million. Those fees accounted for over 1/3 of JMP Securities' revenues last year compared to just 14% in 2015.  We will look to add other M&A professionals to further expand this footprint. Our pipeline in advisory is as strong as ever and growing, and we anticipate a year ahead that could possibly outpace the one that we just had in 2020. We completed a total of 126 investment banking transactions in 2020, with 45% of the fees from health care, 35% from tech and 20% from financial services and real estate. Already, in 2021, JMP Securities has underwritten 15 equity offerings, including 5 IPOs.  In all, we completed 22 investment banking transactions year-to-date. Last year, we invested in 3 growth initiatives that should have lasting impacts for our firm. First, we added two senior research analysts and one senior investment banking to our already highly regarded life sciences practice, which should further enhance our competitive footprint in 2021 and beyond.  Second, we focused on being more active on the front end of SPACs, which we think will enhance our strategic advisory and private placement business going forward. Lastly, we've laid the foundation to enter the cannabis space, initially within our financial services and real estate verticals, but allowing for expansion into technology and health care as 2021 progresses. And now back to you, Joe.\nJoe Jolson: Thanks, Mark. In the past few years, we have proactively sold or spun out all asset management strategies that did not present synergies with JMP Securities' industry coverage. As a result, we have completely exited the hedge fund business and narrowed our focus to venture and private capital strategies that leverage the domain expertise that exists across our firm. We also took steps last year to reduce our structural costs, which allowed for highly positive operating margin leverage in the fourth quarter. Our objective is to sustain a top-tier return on equity at our operating platforms through varying market cycles. With our company more streamlined than ever before, its future value will hinge on the continued success of our investment banking platform, in addition to a conservatively stated and growing book value per share. We are optimistic about JMP's prospects for 2021, but we'll leave it to the market itself to judge. With that, operator, we'd be happy to try to answer any questions. Thank you.\nOperator:\nMark Lehmann: Joe, I'll start first of all by thanking everybody at JMP and most importantly, to the almost 200 people who through 2020 and all the personal and professional challenges that COVID has had us all face, the hard work and dedication and loyalty were extraordinary. And most importantly, the health and safety of our employees is paramount. And I just want to thank everybody for that support for 2020, and I'll leave it to Joe for some concluding comments.\nJoe Jolson: Well, I was -- that's very well said, Mark. I'd reiterate that. And we're -- everyone's really busy here. We're working hard, fully at capacity, and we look forward to reporting our results to everybody in late April, so in a couple of months. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nMark Lehmann: Thanks all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included it's Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investor Bancorp's filings with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn -- please note, this event is being recorded. And now I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cummings: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. Welcome to the Investors Bancorp's third quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $64.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share for three months ended June 30, 2020 September 30, 2020]. This compares to $42.6 million or $0.18 per share for the three months ended June 30 and $52 million or $0.20 per share for the three month period ended June 30, 2019. These results represent a 51% increase in earnings from the second quarter and a 24% increase over the third quarter of 2019. On an EPS basis, the increase in earnings represent 50% increase over the linked quarter and a 35% increase over the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income totaled $146.4 million or $0.62 per diluted share compared to $146.8 million or $0.55 per share for the nine months ended June 30 -- I mean September 30, 2019. During the second quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast, which added approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added seven branches to the New York market and nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. We continue to integrate these branches into our systems, and opportunities for market expansion is strong. Last Saturday, I was invited to a breakfast meeting in Southampton out on the island with prominent businessmen, and the feedback was positive regarding the transition of customers from Gold Coast to Investors. We continue to leverage our brand in this market because we think it is very attractive due to its demographics, concentration of small and midsized businesses and density of high net worth individuals. With respect to our brand, I am happy to report that Investors Bank was selected by Newsweek, a national magazine, as the best bank in the state of New Jersey -- the best big bank in the state of New Jersey. Newsweek used a broad criteria to measure banks throughout the country and identified a bank in each state. They looked for banks with a broad local footprint, and they indicated that customers do not want to have to go too far out of their way when they need to -- a branch or an ATM. They evaluated banks that offer a winning combination of low fees, competitive interest rates and a broad array of services, including a variety of loans and a high-performing mobile app. We are very proud of this recognition by a third party, and it highlights our commitment to expanding our digital platform. During the quarter, we expanded and enhanced our online account opening platform, first to bank customers and then next to small business customers and then to new customers. This account opening platform is fully integrated with our Salesforce management tool, which facilitates the follow-up with customers. The expansion enhancement of the online account opening platform is an enterprise-wide effort and the foundation of an omni-wide experience that will be expanded, which will lead to significant gains in branch efficiency and improvements in the customer experience by digitizing many manual processes in the branches. We are very happy to receive the recognition from Newsweek, but we will continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our digital platform. During the third quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $8.3 million versus $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to a credit of $2.5 million in the third quarter of '19. This provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new accounting requirements. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30 were just $667,000 versus $4.1 million in the second quarter and $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Pre-provision net revenue was $97.5 million for the three months ended September 30 versus $92.1 million for the three months ended June 30, an increase of $5.4 million or 6%. And this -- and we also had an increase of $29.8 million at September 30, '20 or 47% compared to the three months ended last year. That's a 47.7% increase over the same period last year. The bank has spent considerable efforts in evaluating its credit position and has focused its efforts on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q, the company reported approximately $2.2 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $447 million in C&I loans, $903 million in multifamily, $830 billion in commercial real estate loans and -- $830 million in commercial real estate loans and $15 million in construction loans, and that's one construction loan. This second quarter number is down from a total of $3.6 billion earlier in the year. The bank's lending teams continue to be very aggressive, reaching out to customers during this time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we look at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers during a difficult time. We are actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic distress initiated by local government shutdowns. We continue to spend our time actively communicating with these customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. Every Wednesday, we spend time on Zoom calls in a war room-type setting, discussing credits well into the evening hours. After extensive communication with our borrowers and follow up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposure to deferrals significantly. At October 20, total request for deferrals totaled $593 million in the commercial loan book. This is comprised of $282 million in C&I loans, $188 million in multifamily loans and $108 million in commercial real estate loans and a $15 million construction loan. Yesterday, we updated our review of $175 million of loans scheduled to commence payment on November 1, and we anticipate approximately $125 million will return to payment status. $37 million were granted an additional deferral, and approximately $13 million will need additional information before a final decision is made. We have another $70 million scheduled to return to payment status on December 1. And if we anticipate the same results as November, we would expect approximately another $50 million reduction in deferral balances. It should be noted that we are in constant communication with our borrowers during this process, and there may be other additional deferrals as market conditions are fluid. And a lot depends on what the government does in our local markets and the progress made to our journey back to a more normal lifestyle. In addition, we have $200 million in deferred loans scheduled to return to payment as of January 1, and we anticipate going into 2021 with a significantly less exposure. If you take a snapshot at our exposure today, 61% or $362 million of the $593 million in deferrals is concentrated in six relationships: a $46 million multifamily relationship of eight loans, which is expected to return to payment next week; three hotel relationships totaling $268 million; one multifamily loan for $25 million in Queens scheduled to return to payment in December; and an entertainment venue in New Jersey for $23 million scheduled to return to payment in January. The three hotels are family generational seasoned operators who are known to the bank and are good customers in the bank who have earned our support through this crisis. This industry and the restaurant industry are facing very difficult times, but thanks to the cooperation of the regulators, the Fed and the accounting profession, we are able to help these customers through an unprecedented situation. The remaining $230 million in loan deferrals at this time on October 20 is comprised of 113 loans with an average loan of $2 million, and it should be noted that 59 of these loans are less than $1 million in balances outstanding. The weighted average LTV of our entire multifamily portfolio is approximately 53%, with 14% of the portfolio in lower-risk co-op loans. The LTV on the $188 million in deferred multifamily loans is approximately 59% pre-pandemic. We have only $19 million in deferred retail shopping loans, which have an LTV of $54 million, of which one of the larger loans in that group for $7 million is returning to payment next week. Overall, we are pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic today. There is much uncertainty in forecasting future events, and forecasting these results and events are almost impossible, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach has been and is to be proactive in addressing these issues as there will be difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions to date as compared to other banks with similar portfolios in the New York/New Jersey markets and are well positioned to weather this storm. Our allowance for loan losses, the coverage ratio to loans increased to 1.37% from 1.28% at June 30. Tomorrow, we anticipate the closing of a loan sale for $18 million, which will reduce our NPLs to $114 million versus $126.8 million at June 30. We anticipate recording a $1.9 million recovery as a result of this disposition of the loan. With respect to delinquencies, $8.8 million of the $13.6 million in commercial 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, total commercial delinquent loans are $30.6 million, of which one relationship which amounts to $25 million in the CRE portfolio has been approved for extension and will be current once the legal work is completed. Non-accrual loans were $61.8 million or 39 basis points after giving effect to the sale previously mentioned and are well collateralized and have limited exposure. And at this stage, the average loan is approximately $1 million. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan loss reserves in the past three quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans decreased $365 million during the quarter, which was attributable mainly to a reduction in mortgage loans of $295 million and $122 million in multifamily loans. We have slowed the pace of this decline in loans and anticipate some growth in the fourth quarter as we have a robust pipeline and are working diligently to have a strong fourth quarter. As we continue to feel more comfortable to our exposures due to the pandemic's economic impact, we will seize growth opportunities. And as it continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of this year, where we are more focused on the business segment -- more focused on the business lending segment. This is not a major strategy shift but one that we consider very opportunistic. It was a good quarter for deposits as non-interest bearing deposits increased over $300 million or 10% for the quarter. Total deposits decreased $594 million or 7% as we begin the process to reduce our cash position, which negatively impacts our margin. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained stable at 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined nine basis points in the quarter. And there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in this year as we run off our excess cash and we execute on a sales leaseback transaction, which will generate approximately $9 million in a gain, which will be invested in the early retirement of higher-cost wholesale liabilities, which result -- hopefully will result in an expansion of our margin in the fourth quarter. With respect to capital, the company announced a dividend of $0.12 per share and has increased its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans, increased earnings and a reduction in assets. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. And actually, at this time, we look forward to increasing that dividend by $0.01 in January, as we have done over the past several years. With respect to buybacks, we currently have 14.6 million shares approved to be purchased, having purchased over $1.5 billion since our second step. We are prudent in our management of our capital and are excited about the opportunity to resume our buybacks. We are evaluating the uncertainty of the election and the ongoing disruption of the pandemic. We have and continue to discuss this opportunity with our Board and our regulators and believe we are in a strong position to commence buybacks when things settle down post-election in the fourth quarter. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed this turmoil and have been very opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management, technology and product and development, we are better prepared today to serve our customers and our communities, which will result in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on the quarter and our results of operation.\nSean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net income was $64.3 million or $0.27 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $21.7 million or 51% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.79% in the third quarter, with declining cash balances and deposit costs driving the improvement. We expect cash balances and interest cost to further decline in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income rebounded nicely from the second quarter and totaled $19.9 million, an increase of $9.8 million quarter-over-quarter. Strong swap income, mortgage banking activity and wealth and investment product revenues all contributed to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Expenses totaled $104.1 million in Q3, an increase of $4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was largely the result of increased incentive compensation and medical expenses. Included in expenses were approximately $1 million of costs related to the early extinguishment of borrowings in the quarter. Despite the uptick in expenses, our efficiency ratio improved slightly to 51.6% from 52.1% in Q2. Provision for credit losses was $8.3 million for the third quarter compared to $33.3 million for the second quarter. The decrease was driven by improving current and forecasted economic conditions. Third quarter loan originations were strong but not enough to offset the paydowns and payoffs. As a result, total loan balances decreased $364 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by residential and multifamily loan categories. The impact to interest income from declining loan balances was minimized as we're able to allow high-cost funding to run off in Q3. While total deposits were down $384 million quarter-over-quarter, non-interest bearing deposits were up $305 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 18% at September 30, 2020, compared to 14% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continue to remain in a strong position. Non-accrual loans represented 0.63% of total loans at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.59% at June 30, while our allowance for loan -- for credit losses to loans stood at 1.44% at September 30. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13%. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 110% compared to 122% at year-end 2019. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Good. Thanks, Sean. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full service on regular hours, except for the recently mandated hotspots in Brooklyn. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 75% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it is very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch in Southampton, a former Gold Coast branch, on Saturday and listened to their challenges during this pandemic and their transition to our bank. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and, more importantly, helping their customers and our communities through this pandemic. The past eight months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we can get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, some cooperation in Trenton, Albany and Washington, including another stimulus bill, which will then impact our economic models, we expect that we can finish the year with a great fourth quarter. We've been aggressive in calling on our loan customers and have a war room-type attitude toward monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork and cooperation from our line of loan officers and our credit risk teams. This crisis is great different from 2008 as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain this economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events, and I'm much more optimistic than I was in April or July when there was a lot more uncertainty. Our medical professionals and health workers have been outstanding and have learned a lot about the treatment of this virus, and we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. We hit a goal of 10% return on tangible equity for the quarter. Our earnings per share increased 35% to last year after taking additional provisions in the quarter with less net charge-offs. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I'd like to turn this call over to questions. Andrea?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Good morning. Kevin, just to follow up on the buyback comments that you made. With the TCE ratio pushing 10% and the stock trading sort of 75% of tangible book value, I guess I'm curious why would -- you still have the buyback in place, why would you be executing on that right now even before the elections?\nKevin Cummings: Mark, I think it's our way of being prudent. There's such uncertainty in the market. We're continuing to evaluate it, and I think we're just waiting after the dust settles after the election and have some continued discussion with the other constituents that are involved mainly our regulators. We did the big repurchase at the end of last year, and we want to manage it in a -- similar to what we've done since the first step through the second step in a prudent manner. So it's a wait-and-see attitude, see what happens to the markets afterwards. And our plan is to continue to buy back sometime in the very, very near future.\nDomenick Cama: And Mark, it's Domenick, and if I could just add another comment to that. Obviously, we recognize that the buying back of the stock is a good investment for us, and it's something that we want to do. We have already had some preliminary discussions with our regulators and with our Board. And it's -- I remember someone saying to me once, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. And so I think as Kevin said in his prepared remarks, things look good that we will resume buying back the stock sometime in the fourth quarter. But we would like to touch -- would like to do a little more analysis on it and have more discussions with the constituents that Kevin mentioned.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then secondly, it looks like you still have about $4 billion of borrowings at an average rate of 2.22%. I guess I'm curious how much of those will roll off over the next few quarters. And should we expect more prepayments like you did this quarter?\nDomenick Cama: Yes, Mark. Actually, we don't have any more borrowings coming due this quarter, but we do have about $1 billion of brokered CDs and retail CDs maturing over the quarter at an average cost of about 150 basis points. So, that's going to give us some momentum for NIM for the end of the fourth quarter. We are also looking at -- I think Kevin mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks that we did sign a contract to do a sale leaseback in which we're expecting a gain of somewhere between $7 million and $9 million. And our thinking is that we'll take that money, that gain, and use it to offset prepaid fees on borrowings that are averaging a cost of about 2%. So still -- and so we'll get some more momentum from that. But, in terms of this quarter, the big gain will be in the form of brokered CDs. There are no borrowings left to pay off this quarter.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Sean, I apologize. I missed your comments on your expense outlook for 4Q.\nSean Burke: Well, you missed it because I didn't provide one.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Well, let me rephrase. Can you provide one?\nSean Burke: We believe expenses will be similar to Q3.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then lastly, I wondered if you're seeing much of a difference in credit performance from your multifamily and commercial real estate loans in New York versus New Jersey.\nDomenick Cama: Mark, on collection rates, I think we continue to see collection rates at about 85% for multi and about 50% to 60% on CRE. But I did want to put out one piece of information that wasn't in the deck that we put out. And specifically about Manhattan, we looked at the deferrals in Manhattan by category. And the LTVs of our multifamily loans in Manhattan is approximately 54%, and these are deferred balances in Manhattan. The lodging category, which is obviously the biggest category that we have of deferments, $244 million sit in Manhattan. And the weighted average LTV of those properties is approximately 49%. So, those are the two big categories in Manhattan, and I know there's been a lot of discussion around the industry about the knock on Manhattan and what's going on there. But, we feel very good about the LTV situation and the fact that the customers we're dealing with have a significant amount of equity in their properties in Manhattan, and we deem it a very low probability that they're going to walk away from these properties.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nJared Shaw: Good morning, guys. Just circling back on the margin, you talked about the runoff in the resi book and some opportunities for growth elsewhere. Should we expect or can we expect to see maybe an improvement in loan yields quarter-over-quarter on the core book based on that change in mix? Or should we expect sort of loan yields stay roughly where they are?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I think you actually may see a reduction in loan yields, Jared, because -- I mean if you just look at what the average loan yield was in our residential book, quarter-over-quarter was approximately the same. But if you go back a year in our residential book, we're down almost 40 basis points. So that resi book, we're continuing to put loans on. We're just not putting on as many as we were in prior years. On the multifamily side, we have now moved our pipeline up significantly. On the CRE front, our pipeline is about $1.7 billion. And the weighted average cost of the CRE pipeline is about 3.90%. So that will bring down the yield on the CRE book. C&I is about $800 million, and that's a little bit more difficult to project. But the combination of multifamily loans and residential loans continuing to come on the balance sheet will, I think, have the effect of lowering our average yield on loans.\nSean Burke: If I may, Jared, it's Sean. I just wanted to add a comment, though, the trend that really benefiting margin in the third quarter, which are declining cash balances with very low average yields and deposit costs continuing to come down, we expect that will continue in Q4. And despite maybe some headwind on the loan side, we do expect improvement in margin in Q4, a similar ilk to that we experienced in the third quarter.\nJared Shaw: Great. That's great color. And then just circling back again on the credit and the trends you're talking about on those deferred loans, which is great. Are those values at origination? And I guess what are you seeing in terms of valuation impact from COVID? Obviously, you're not doing full reappraisals. But, are you seeing valuations really get hit because of this? And if you did mark those to market, what would you guess they look like?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I mean we haven't seen any significant decline in valuations. I mean we look specifically at cap rates, and cap rates continue to be in that 4.5% to 5.5% range. So, no significant decline there. On some of the C&I properties, it's a little bit more difficult to do because, obviously, operating income has been impacted. And, trying to put a valuation on a hotel, for example, its operating business, is difficult right now. So specifically, though, in the commercial real estate and multifamily sector, while we have seen a tick up in cap rates, it has not been significant. It's not actually what I expected it to be. It just -- it stayed pretty stable.\nKevin Cummings: Jared, I don't think we see like a panic in the market. People aren't knocking on our doors giving back the keys. I think there's still confidence in the market. We don't see a panic out there dealing with the hotel operators, like they are generational owners. One in particular has put up a six months of payments in escrow on a large exposure, multi-properties -- multi-numbered properties. And, I think we're working with borrowers. It's a small group. Like I said, 61%, $360-plus million is in six relationships, and we know these customers very well. And I think it's -- we feel much more confident than we were sitting here six months ago.\nJared Shaw: Okay, great. And then just finally for me, as we look at the allowance level, if we make the assumption that the macro model doesn't change, the macroeconomic model doesn't change, is this a good high watermark for the allowance? And as you start dealing with some of those remainder loans that either on deferral or don't return to payment and if there's a charge-off needed there, should we just expect that provision -- or allowance as adequate? And you can see maybe a future decline as those loans are resolved?\nSean Burke: I think it's a big if, but we understand if forecasted conditions improve or remain similar, then, yes, I would agree with your statement, Jared. But, also keep in mind that loan volume and loan production and loan balances also impact that. So, we've seen declining loan balances. And if that -- if the tide were to turn there and we would see more production, it could lead to increased provision as it relates to loan volume.\nJared Shaw: Thanks a lot.\nKevin Cummings: Jared, that reminds me of a question I used to get when I was with Peat Marwick in 1991, '92 when the audit committee just asked me if the allowance is adequate. And I said, yes, today, it is, but God only knows in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Duong of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteven Duong: Good morning, guys. Just on the Manhattan, the CRE exposure. I just want to confirm if I heard that right, that it's primarily just the multifamily and the lodging that you guys spoke about?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. Well, I think we put a deck out last night or this morning. But if you look at Manhattan, Manhattan has total deferments of $313 million. And the composition of that is $243 million in lodging, $58 million in multifamily and then $10 million CRE and $1 million in C&I.\nSteven Duong: All right. Perfect. Now, that -- the deck was really, really helpful. And then just on the buyback, the remaining capacity that you have, that's about roughly $150 million, $120 million. So that's a little more than 50% of a year's earnings. Assuming you go through that in the next few quarters, I guess looking beyond that, would you be open to starting another buyback program next year?\nDomenick Cama: Of course, we always look at the buyback as an effective way to manage our capital. And obviously, if it makes sense to buy back the stock and we've run out of authorization, of course, we would go back to the Board and ask them to reauthorize an additional allotment.\nSteven Duong: Great. And just along those lines, is there a target capital level that you would like to be above?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I mean, again, you're asking me that question in the middle of a pandemic. If you had asked me, say, two years ago, I might have said 8.5%. And these days, it's more like 9.5%. So, it just depends on where we are at a particular point in the cycle. But it's difficult to say that in all situations, this is where I would be very happy.\nSteven Duong: Understood. And then you made a comment about the pipeline in fourth quarter looking good. Are there any particular segments that you're more optimistic about in the fourth quarter?\nA \u2013 Domenick Cama: Yes. Health care is having a good quarter. The C&I book, we think we're going to close about $500 million in the fourth quarter. That's -- I spoke to our Chief Lending Officer this morning about that. And multifamily has opened up a little bit. We have approximately $250 million of new C&I loans in the pipeline. And, I should mention that despite the continued reduction in multifamily loans that has occurred quarter-over-quarter, this month, we have finally stopped that bleeding. So, we're actually flat for the month.\nSteven Duong: That's great news. And then just last question for me. Your non-interest bearing deposits grew pretty well this quarter. Can you just give us some color like what drove the growth?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. Steve, we -- obviously, we had some PPP money in there that continue to come in. We had -- also, we put out a team of bankers, business bankers that we talked about last year. And those folks have started to reap some benefit. We're doing more C&I lending. We are doing more treasury management. And those two factors are having the effect of bringing more non-interest bearing deposits in. So it's been our strategy to continue to transition the bank from a traditional thrift to a commercial bank, and I think we're finally starting to see some benefit from those strategic decisions.\nSteven Duong: Good to hear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Breese of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Breese: Hi, good morning. I appreciate the color on the near-term margin. Just considering the average balance sheet and the opportunity to continue to reprice the CDs, there's obviously room on the borrowings front. And then average new loan yields don't sound terribly off from where they are now. As we look into next year and you deploy the cash, where could we see the margin expand to? Where do you see that plateau mark?\nSean Burke: So, we are going to reap the benefits of continued repricing of both borrowings and deposits, and so there is a tailwind there. And we believe that the benefit -- there's still a lot of benefit there, not only in Q4, but looking out into 2021, Matt. So, I think where you'd start to maybe peter out running out of that tailwind, probably the second half of 2021 is where you could see some trail off there. But we could have 20 more basis points to go here. I mean, ideally, we would like to see something in the 3% range. That may be a little bit of a stretch, but I think that's a stretched goal for us. And, not saying that we're going to get there, but that's a target that we have in mind.\nDomenick Cama: And Matt, if I could just add to Sean's comment, so you -- obviously, you get the benefit that he described on the deposit side. But our continued remixing of the asset side of the balance sheet is going to continue to provide benefit to us. We're seeing yields on C&I loans of 50 basis points to 5/8, above where multifamily and CRE are coming in. So, as we continue to focus on the C&I front, that will help to add to NIM also.\nMatthew Breese: Excellent. I appreciate that. You mentioned several points of the pipeline that sound relatively strong. Looking into the fourth quarter and beginning of 2021, how do you feel about net loan growth prospects? Can we expand gross loans from here?\nDomenick Cama: Well, I think that net loan growth will be better as we head into '21. I think that, as I said earlier on the multifamily front, I think that we've stopped that bleeding. We are looking at ways to stop the bleeding on the residential side. We're dropping there probably $60 million to $70 million a month despite the activity that we have in that portfolio. And we're looking at -- now I should add the comment that it was a strategic decision to start to slow down residential balances on our balance sheet. However, when the pandemic came along, that presented an opportunity for us with wider spreads. Having said all of that, I think, Matt, it would depend on resi. If I can get resi to stabilize, we should see growth in 2021. We're going through the budget process right now. And while I'm not trying to give guidance at all here, we are projecting growth in 2021. And that budget hasn't been approved yet, but we are looking at ways to continue to grow the loans in 2021. Because, again, as Sean described earlier, the steam is going to run out just based on the -- getting rid of the cash balances, and we need to start to generate growth to continue to add to NIM.\nMatthew Breese: Understood. Okay, last one for me. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're getting 50% to 60% rent collection on the commercial real estate asset class. What are the components within that? What is it for office versus retail and hotels? You mentioned -- also mentioned 85% rent collection in multifamily. What is that in New York versus New Jersey?\nDomenick Cama: Matt, I don't have that breakdown. I would say that New Jersey is probably doing a little bit better than New York in all of the categories, but I don't have a specific -- I don't have the numbers to support your question. So -- but if you'd like, I can look up that information, and we can send that out to you.\nMatthew Breese: Sure. Would appreciate it. That's all I had. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes, thank you. Good morning. These slides are great, and I'm probably missing it, so I just need your help finding it. So the -- of the $7.256 billion of multifamily, it looks like $3.049 billion is in New York City. But what I can't find, unless I'm not reading it properly, is the $188 million that you have in multifamily deferrals. What -- how much of that is actually in New York City?\nDomenick Cama: Debt of $58 million is in Manhattan.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, okay. Yes, I'm sorry. You gave that number earlier, and I just -- I couldn't find where it was. Okay. And so the $46 million of multifamily loans that you mentioned that are returning to payment status next week, is that coming out of the New York bucket? Or is that New Jersey bucket?\nDomenick Cama: It's coming out of the New York bucket, mainly out of Manhattan, like in Bronx and other boroughs.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, that's great. And then just a quick accounting question for you, Sean. The $1.9 million recovery that you're going to book on the non-performing loan disposition tomorrow, is that hitting your top line, your net interest income? Or is that going into non-interest income?\nSean Burke: No, that will be in provision through the allowance of your recovery.\nKevin Cummings: The allowance.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Recovery in the allowance. Okay. Perfect. That's all I have. Appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead.\nCollyn Gilbert: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one final question for me. Dom, you kind of touched on it, but just wanted to get your thoughts on the mortgage banking outlook. Dom, you kind of indicated your appetite for, perhaps, portfolio-ing more resi production. But just broadly, how we should be thinking about that. Because obviously, that was a huge, huge number this quarter.\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I mean it's been a great business. I mean some of the spreads that we've seen on mortgage banking have been pretty remarkable. I mean this morning, just going through our rate meeting, selling loans to Fannie Mae at two 3/4%, we're reaping a price of 102. So to the extent that we can continue to generate business loans for sale to Fannie, we're going to continue to do that. And actually, one of the questions we had this morning was should we lower the rate and take less price from Fannie, and the consensus was that we want to maintain the quality of the underwriting process and the closing process. And we felt that we could be adding too much pressure to the group. So it's a long-winded answer, Collyn, but I think you're going to continue to see more non-interest income as we go through next quarter and the early part of 2021 because that business is really hitting on all cylinders.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay, that's helpful. And then just the corresponding expense to that. I know you had indicated that this quarter's expenses were up because of incentive comp. Is there a big number there, a big delta in there for what the mortgage commissions would be as well?\nSean Burke: It's not a huge delta, but it is part of it. So the compensation -- a bigger piece of it, quite honestly, is the retail incentives. And we've had very good low-cost deposits and non-interest bearing deposit growth that we've incentivized our people to do and generate. And so that, in large part, is driving higher incentive comp.\nKevin Cummings: Collyn, the commission on the sale of mortgage loans is netted in the gain on sale.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. Just want to make that. Okay, got it. Okay, thank you very much. That's all I had.\nKevin Cummings: Thank you, Collyn.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Thanks, Andrea. First of all, I'd like to thank you all for participation today. Our country is a great country. It's a strong country, but it's not perfect. We have created a country of great opportunities. But like Investors Bank, we need to continue to get stronger, improve and listen to all our constituents. Not going to be easy in 2021, regardless of Tuesday's results. We at Investors are well positioned to move forward into next year with great hope and optimism. We will create great opportunities for all our customers, employees and the communities that we serve. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow the CDC guidelines. Listen to that Jesuit educated Dr. Fauci. Wear a mask and stay away from crowds.\nDomenick Cama: And wash your hands.\nKevin Cummings: Yes, wash your hands. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And I said it earlier, in July, the journey is the destination. I want to again thank you for your participation today. And I look forward to the day we can get out on the road and be visiting with you all soon. Enjoy Halloween, as I know I will, as it is my first granddaughter's first birthday. Raptors won its first road game on the road last week, and college pro football continues. I think we have to be optimistic. Life is good, and we need to cherish the moments. It's another step back to normalcy, and let's continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe, and God bless. Thanks for your time today, and have a great day. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "And Mark, it's Domenick, and if I could just add another comment to that.

Yes. I think you actually may see a reduction in loan yields, Jared, because -- I mean if you just look at what the average loan yield was in our residential book, quarter-over-quarter was approximately the same. But if you go back a year in our residential book, we're down almost 40 basis points. So that resi book, we're continuing to put loans on. We're just not putting on as many as we were in prior years. On the multifamily side, we have now moved our pipeline up significantly. On the CRE front, our pipeline is about $1.7 billion. And the weighted average cost of the CRE pipeline is about 3.90%. So that will bring down the yield on the CRE book. C&I is about $800 million, and that's a little bit more difficult to project. But the combination of multifamily loans and residential loans continuing to come on the balance sheet will, I think, have the effect of lowering our average yield on loans. Yes. I mean we haven't seen any significant decline in valuations. I mean we look specifically at cap rates, and cap rates continue to be in that 4.5% to 5.5% range. So, no significant decline there. On some of the C&I properties, it's a little bit more difficult to do because, obviously, operating income has been impacted. And, trying to put a valuation on a hotel, for example, its operating business, is difficult right now. So specifically, though, in the commercial real estate and multifamily sector, while we have seen a tick up in cap rates, it has not been significant. It's not actually what I expected it to be. It just -- it stayed pretty stable. Yes. Well, I think we put a deck out last night or this morning. But if you look at Manhattan, Manhattan has total deferments of $313 million.

            "name": "Sean Burke",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Net income was $64.3 million or $0.27 per share for the three months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of $21.7 million or 51% quarter-over-quarter and 24% year-over-year. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.79% in the third quarter, with declining cash balances and deposit costs driving the improvement. We expect cash balances and interest cost to further decline in the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income rebounded nicely from the second quarter and totaled $19.9 million, an increase of $9.8 million quarter-over-quarter. Strong swap income, mortgage banking activity and wealth and investment product revenues all contributed to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Expenses totaled $104.1 million in Q3, an increase of $4 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase was largely the result of increased incentive compensation and medical expenses. Included in expenses were approximately $1 million of costs related to the early extinguishment of borrowings in the quarter. Despite the uptick in expenses, our efficiency ratio improved slightly to 51.6% from 52.1% in Q2. Provision for credit losses was $8.3 million for the third quarter compared to $33.3 million for the second quarter. The decrease was driven by improving current and forecasted economic conditions. Third quarter loan originations were strong but not enough to offset the paydowns and payoffs. As a result, total loan balances decreased $364 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by residential and multifamily loan categories. The impact to interest income from declining loan balances was minimized as we're able to allow high-cost funding to run off in Q3. While total deposits were down $384 million quarter-over-quarter, non-interest bearing deposits were up $305 million or 10% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 18% at September 30, 2020, compared to 14% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continue to remain in a strong position. Non-accrual loans represented 0.63% of total loans at September 30, 2020, compared to 0.59% at June 30, while our allowance for loan -- for credit losses to loans stood at 1.44% at September 30. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13%. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 110% compared to 122% at year-end 2019. Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks. Well, you missed it because I didn't provide one. We believe expenses will be similar to Q3. If I may, Jared, it's Sean. I just wanted to add a comment, though, the trend that really benefiting margin in the third quarter, which are declining cash balances with very low average yields and deposit costs continuing to come down, we expect that will continue in Q4. And despite maybe some headwind on the loan side, we do expect improvement in margin in Q4, a similar ilk to that we experienced in the third quarter. I think it's a big if, but we understand if forecasted conditions improve or remain similar, then, yes, I would agree with your statement, Jared. But, also keep in mind that loan volume and loan production and loan balances also impact that. So, we've seen declining loan balances. And if that -- if the tide were to turn there and we would see more production, it could lead to increased provision as it relates to loan volume. So, we are going to reap the benefits of continued repricing of both borrowings and deposits, and so there is a tailwind there. And we believe that the benefit -- there's still a lot of benefit there, not only in Q4, but looking out into 2021, Matt. So, I think where you'd start to maybe peter out running out of that tailwind, probably the second half of 2021 is where you could see some trail off there. But we could have 20 more basis points to go here. I mean, ideally, we would like to see something in the 3% range. That may be a little bit of a stretch, but I think that's a stretched goal for us. And, not saying that we're going to get there, but that's a target that we have in mind. No, that will be in provision through the allowance of your recovery. It's not a huge delta, but it is part of it. So the compensation -- a bigger piece of it, quite honestly, is the retail incentives. And we've had very good low-cost deposits and non-interest bearing deposit growth that we've incentivized our people to do and generate. And so that, in large part, is driving higher incentive comp."

            "content": "Thank you, Andrea, and good morning. Welcome to the Investors Bancorp's third quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $64.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share for three months ended June 30, 2020 September 30, 2020]. This compares to $42.6 million or $0.18 per share for the three months ended June 30 and $52 million or $0.20 per share for the three month period ended June 30, 2019. These results represent a 51% increase in earnings from the second quarter and a 24% increase over the third quarter of 2019. On an EPS basis, the increase in earnings represent 50% increase over the linked quarter and a 35% increase over the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, net income totaled $146.4 million or $0.62 per diluted share compared to $146.8 million or $0.55 per share for the nine months ended June 30 -- I mean September 30, 2019. During the second quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast, which added approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added seven branches to the New York market and nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. We continue to integrate these branches into our systems, and opportunities for market expansion is strong. Last Saturday, I was invited to a breakfast meeting in Southampton out on the island with prominent businessmen, and the feedback was positive regarding the transition of customers from Gold Coast to Investors. We continue to leverage our brand in this market because we think it is very attractive due to its demographics, concentration of small and midsized businesses and density of high net worth individuals. With respect to our brand, I am happy to report that Investors Bank was selected by Newsweek, a national magazine, as the best bank in the state of New Jersey -- the best big bank in the state of New Jersey. Newsweek used a broad criteria to measure banks throughout the country and identified a bank in each state. They looked for banks with a broad local footprint, and they indicated that customers do not want to have to go too far out of their way when they need to -- a branch or an ATM. They evaluated banks that offer a winning combination of low fees, competitive interest rates and a broad array of services, including a variety of loans and a high-performing mobile app. We are very proud of this recognition by a third party, and it highlights our commitment to expanding our digital platform. During the quarter, we expanded and enhanced our online account opening platform, first to bank customers and then next to small business customers and then to new customers. This account opening platform is fully integrated with our Salesforce management tool, which facilitates the follow-up with customers. The expansion enhancement of the online account opening platform is an enterprise-wide effort and the foundation of an omni-wide experience that will be expanded, which will lead to significant gains in branch efficiency and improvements in the customer experience by digitizing many manual processes in the branches. We are very happy to receive the recognition from Newsweek, but we will continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our digital platform. During the third quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $8.3 million versus $33.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to a credit of $2.5 million in the third quarter of '19. This provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the new accounting requirements. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended September 30 were just $667,000 versus $4.1 million in the second quarter and $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. Pre-provision net revenue was $97.5 million for the three months ended September 30 versus $92.1 million for the three months ended June 30, an increase of $5.4 million or 6%. And this -- and we also had an increase of $29.8 million at September 30, '20 or 47% compared to the three months ended last year. That's a 47.7% increase over the same period last year. The bank has spent considerable efforts in evaluating its credit position and has focused its efforts on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q, the company reported approximately $2.2 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $447 million in C&I loans, $903 million in multifamily, $830 billion in commercial real estate loans and -- $830 million in commercial real estate loans and $15 million in construction loans, and that's one construction loan. This second quarter number is down from a total of $3.6 billion earlier in the year. The bank's lending teams continue to be very aggressive, reaching out to customers during this time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we look at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers during a difficult time. We are actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic distress initiated by local government shutdowns. We continue to spend our time actively communicating with these customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. Every Wednesday, we spend time on Zoom calls in a war room-type setting, discussing credits well into the evening hours. After extensive communication with our borrowers and follow up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposure to deferrals significantly. At October 20, total request for deferrals totaled $593 million in the commercial loan book. This is comprised of $282 million in C&I loans, $188 million in multifamily loans and $108 million in commercial real estate loans and a $15 million construction loan. Yesterday, we updated our review of $175 million of loans scheduled to commence payment on November 1, and we anticipate approximately $125 million will return to payment status. $37 million were granted an additional deferral, and approximately $13 million will need additional information before a final decision is made. We have another $70 million scheduled to return to payment status on December 1. And if we anticipate the same results as November, we would expect approximately another $50 million reduction in deferral balances. It should be noted that we are in constant communication with our borrowers during this process, and there may be other additional deferrals as market conditions are fluid. And a lot depends on what the government does in our local markets and the progress made to our journey back to a more normal lifestyle. In addition, we have $200 million in deferred loans scheduled to return to payment as of January 1, and we anticipate going into 2021 with a significantly less exposure. If you take a snapshot at our exposure today, 61% or $362 million of the $593 million in deferrals is concentrated in six relationships: a $46 million multifamily relationship of eight loans, which is expected to return to payment next week; three hotel relationships totaling $268 million; one multifamily loan for $25 million in Queens scheduled to return to payment in December; and an entertainment venue in New Jersey for $23 million scheduled to return to payment in January. The three hotels are family generational seasoned operators who are known to the bank and are good customers in the bank who have earned our support through this crisis. This industry and the restaurant industry are facing very difficult times, but thanks to the cooperation of the regulators, the Fed and the accounting profession, we are able to help these customers through an unprecedented situation. The remaining $230 million in loan deferrals at this time on October 20 is comprised of 113 loans with an average loan of $2 million, and it should be noted that 59 of these loans are less than $1 million in balances outstanding. The weighted average LTV of our entire multifamily portfolio is approximately 53%, with 14% of the portfolio in lower-risk co-op loans. The LTV on the $188 million in deferred multifamily loans is approximately 59% pre-pandemic. We have only $19 million in deferred retail shopping loans, which have an LTV of $54 million, of which one of the larger loans in that group for $7 million is returning to payment next week. Overall, we are pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic today. There is much uncertainty in forecasting future events, and forecasting these results and events are almost impossible, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach has been and is to be proactive in addressing these issues as there will be difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions to date as compared to other banks with similar portfolios in the New York/New Jersey markets and are well positioned to weather this storm. Our allowance for loan losses, the coverage ratio to loans increased to 1.37% from 1.28% at June 30. Tomorrow, we anticipate the closing of a loan sale for $18 million, which will reduce our NPLs to $114 million versus $126.8 million at June 30. We anticipate recording a $1.9 million recovery as a result of this disposition of the loan. With respect to delinquencies, $8.8 million of the $13.6 million in commercial 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, total commercial delinquent loans are $30.6 million, of which one relationship which amounts to $25 million in the CRE portfolio has been approved for extension and will be current once the legal work is completed. Non-accrual loans were $61.8 million or 39 basis points after giving effect to the sale previously mentioned and are well collateralized and have limited exposure. And at this stage, the average loan is approximately $1 million. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan loss reserves in the past three quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans decreased $365 million during the quarter, which was attributable mainly to a reduction in mortgage loans of $295 million and $122 million in multifamily loans. We have slowed the pace of this decline in loans and anticipate some growth in the fourth quarter as we have a robust pipeline and are working diligently to have a strong fourth quarter. As we continue to feel more comfortable to our exposures due to the pandemic's economic impact, we will seize growth opportunities. And as it continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of this year, where we are more focused on the business segment -- more focused on the business lending segment. This is not a major strategy shift but one that we consider very opportunistic. It was a good quarter for deposits as non-interest bearing deposits increased over $300 million or 10% for the quarter. Total deposits decreased $594 million or 7% as we begin the process to reduce our cash position, which negatively impacts our margin. Our loan-to-deposit ratio remained stable at 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined nine basis points in the quarter. And there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in this year as we run off our excess cash and we execute on a sales leaseback transaction, which will generate approximately $9 million in a gain, which will be invested in the early retirement of higher-cost wholesale liabilities, which result -- hopefully will result in an expansion of our margin in the fourth quarter. With respect to capital, the company announced a dividend of $0.12 per share and has increased its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans, increased earnings and a reduction in assets. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. And actually, at this time, we look forward to increasing that dividend by $0.01 in January, as we have done over the past several years. With respect to buybacks, we currently have 14.6 million shares approved to be purchased, having purchased over $1.5 billion since our second step. We are prudent in our management of our capital and are excited about the opportunity to resume our buybacks. We are evaluating the uncertainty of the election and the ongoing disruption of the pandemic. We have and continue to discuss this opportunity with our Board and our regulators and believe we are in a strong position to commence buybacks when things settle down post-election in the fourth quarter. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed this turmoil and have been very opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management, technology and product and development, we are better prepared today to serve our customers and our communities, which will result in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now, I'd like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on the quarter and our results of operation. Good. Thanks, Sean. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full service on regular hours, except for the recently mandated hotspots in Brooklyn. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 75% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it is very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch in Southampton, a former Gold Coast branch, on Saturday and listened to their challenges during this pandemic and their transition to our bank. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and, more importantly, helping their customers and our communities through this pandemic. The past eight months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we can get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, some cooperation in Trenton, Albany and Washington, including another stimulus bill, which will then impact our economic models, we expect that we can finish the year with a great fourth quarter. We've been aggressive in calling on our loan customers and have a war room-type attitude toward monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork and cooperation from our line of loan officers and our credit risk teams. This crisis is great different from 2008 as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain this economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events, and I'm much more optimistic than I was in April or July when there was a lot more uncertainty. Our medical professionals and health workers have been outstanding and have learned a lot about the treatment of this virus, and we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. We hit a goal of 10% return on tangible equity for the quarter. Our earnings per share increased 35% to last year after taking additional provisions in the quarter with less net charge-offs. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I'd like to turn this call over to questions. Andrea? Mark, I think it's our way of being prudent. There's such uncertainty in the market. We're continuing to evaluate it, and I think we're just waiting after the dust settles after the election and have some continued discussion with the other constituents that are involved mainly our regulators. We did the big repurchase at the end of last year, and we want to manage it in a -- similar to what we've done since the first step through the second step in a prudent manner. So it's a wait-and-see attitude, see what happens to the markets afterwards. And our plan is to continue to buy back sometime in the very, very near future. Jared, I don't think we see like a panic in the market. People aren't knocking on our doors giving back the keys. I think there's still confidence in the market. We don't see a panic out there dealing with the hotel operators, like they are generational owners. One in particular has put up a six months of payments in escrow on a large exposure, multi-properties -- multi-numbered properties. And, I think we're working with borrowers. It's a small group. Like I said, 61%, $360-plus million is in six relationships, and we know these customers very well. And I think it's -- we feel much more confident than we were sitting here six months ago. Jared, that reminds me of a question I used to get when I was with Peat Marwick in 1991, '92 when the audit committee just asked me if the allowance is adequate. And I said, yes, today, it is, but God only knows in the future. The allowance. Collyn, the commission on the sale of mortgage loans is netted in the gain on sale. Thank you, Collyn. Thanks, Andrea. First of all, I'd like to thank you all for participation today. Our country is a great country. It's a strong country, but it's not perfect. We have created a country of great opportunities. But like Investors Bank, we need to continue to get stronger, improve and listen to all our constituents. Not going to be easy in 2021, regardless of Tuesday's results. We at Investors are well positioned to move forward into next year with great hope and optimism. We will create great opportunities for all our customers, employees and the communities that we serve. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow the CDC guidelines. Listen to that Jesuit educated Dr. Fauci. Wear a mask and stay away from crowds. Yes, wash your hands. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And I said it earlier, in July, the journey is the destination. I want to again thank you for your participation today. And I look forward to the day we can get out on the road and be visiting with you all soon. Enjoy Halloween, as I know I will, as it is my first granddaughter's first birthday. Raptors won its first road game on the road last week, and college pro football continues. I think we have to be optimistic. Life is good, and we need to cherish the moments. It's another step back to normalcy, and let's continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe, and God bless. Thanks for your time today, and have a great day. Appreciate it."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. We will begin this morning\u2019s call with the company\u2019s standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operation and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp\u2019s control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to result materially different from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night\u2019s press release, the company included its safe harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. That document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussions and Analyst of Financial Condition and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp\u2019s filings with the SEC. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cummings: Thank you, Nick, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $42.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $39.5 million or $0.17 per share for the quarter ended March 31, and $46 million or $0.18 per share for the 3-month period ended June 30, 2019. For the 6 months ended June 30, net income totaled $82.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to $94.8 million or $0.36 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2019. During the quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast Bank, which had approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added 7 branches in the New York market, nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. These customers have attractive demographics and give us opportunity to leverage our business models to customers in that market. Getting this transaction completed during this pandemic is attributed to the grit and tenacity of the bank, as we closed the transaction, rebranded the branches and completed the data processing conversion during the weekend of April 3. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $12 million in goodwill and approximately $2.5 million in core deposit intangibles. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $33.3 million versus $31.3 million in the first quarter of 2020, and this compares to a credit of $3 million in the second quarter of 2019. This elevated provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-provision net revenue was $92.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $6.7 million or almost 8% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2020. And this is also an increase of $29.8 million or 48% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019. The bank has spent considerable effort in evaluating its credit position and has focused its effort on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our March 31 Q, the company reported approximately $3.6 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $600 million in C&I loans, $1.4 billion in multifamily loans, and $1.6 billion in CRE. The bank\u2019s lending teams were very aggressive reaching out to customers during a time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we looked at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers. We were actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic lockdown initiated by local governments. We have spent the last 10 weeks actively communicating with our customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. After extensive communications with our borrowers and follow-up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposures to deferrals significantly. At July 24, total requests and that\u2019s different than \u2013 total request for second deferrals totaled $480 million, and which was comprised of $218 million in C&I loans, $87 million in multifamily loans and $175 million in commercial real estate. We have performed detailed reviews on 79% of the original $3.6 billion in deferrals to date. We anticipate on completion of this entire review of deferred loans, a second deferral exposure for commercial loans of approximately $750 million or 5% of commercial loans. As mentioned earlier, of the $480 million in loans that have requested second deferrals, approximately $292 million is concentrated in the accommodations and food services sector. Of that amount, $230 million are hotel loans to 2 relationships who have strong liquidity and are proven generational operators. One relationship had deferred loans with an average LTV pre-COVID of 45% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.85. And the other relationship is also for deferred loans, with an average LTV of 51% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.42. Both these borrowers have good locations in desirable areas of Manhattan. In the retail sector, we have approximate exposure of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020, that\u2019s the entire commercial portfolio and an initial deferral amount of $880 million, which has been reduced to $380 million by borrowers making their July 1 payment. Based on discussions with borrowers, we expect further reduction upon completion of the initial 3-month deferral period of $258 million, which would result in second deferrals in the retail portfolio of approximately $130 million. In the office sector, our total loan exposure is $1.2 billion, with initial deferrals of $186 million. As of July 22, we have received the July 1 payment for loans totaling $35 million, which results in a current deferral balance of $151 million. Based upon follow-up with our borrowers, we anticipate further reduction of $115 million in the office deferral balances as a result of payments principally scheduled for August 1, which would result in a second deferral balance of approximately $36 million for this sector. In the multifamily sector, we have total exposure of $7.4 billion at June 30, with initial deferrals of $1.4 billion, which have been reduced to $900 million due to payments received in July. We expect those deferrals to be further reduced upon the completion of the initial 3-month deferral period by August and September payments to approximately $100 million. So in summary, today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of loan deferrals in the office, retail and multifamily sectors. We expect, based on current conditions of our borrowers, that those deferral balances will be reduced to $260 million at the end of their initial first 3-month deferral period, which is ending August 1, September 1, and to a limited extent, October 1. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic to date. There is much uncertainty and forecasting future events and results are sometimes very difficult, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach is to be proactive in addressing these issues as it will be in the future difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions as compared to banks with similar portfolios in the New York, New Jersey markets, and we are well positioned to weather this storm. With respect to charge-offs for the quarter, we had one significant charge-off on a multifamily loan for $3.5 million that was not pandemic-related. And have had the loan written down to 80% of current appraised value, which was received recently in May. With respect to delinquencies, $15.3 million of the $24 million in multifamily 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. $6.5 million of the $10.6 million in CRE 30-day delinquencies are current as of today. And $5.9 million of the $7.5 million in C&I 30-day portfolio is current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, the only significant exposure is in the multifamily, which totals $19.1 million, of which $9.9 million is current today. $4.8 million has been approved for its first deferral and $4.4 million is a maturity where there is a contract for sale. In the 90-day bucket, the only significant increase was in the multifamily portfolio, where the reference loan with this quarter\u2019s charge-off that now has a carrying value of $18 million was moved into the 90-day delinquent bucket during the quarter. In addition, there were 5 small additional credits with an average balance of $1.4 million, which moved into non-accrual status during the quarter. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan reserves in the past 2 quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans increased $75 million during the quarter, which was attributable to the Gold Coast acquisition and the origination of approximately $328 million in PPP loans. Without those transactions, loans would have declined by approximately $700 million. With the uncertainty that we are looking at \u2013 with the uncertainty that we were looking at in March and April, it was prudent to take our foot off the accelerator and build liquidity to manage the challenge of this economic environment. As we get a better handle on our exposures to the pandemic economic impact, we will assess our growth opportunities. As the economy continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, where we were more focused on business lending side. This is not a major strategy shift, but one that will be opportunistic based on current interest rates. It was a strong quarter for deposits as noninterest-bearing deposits increased $618 million or 25% for the quarter, of which $93 million was attributable to Gold Coast. Total deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7%, which \u2013 of which $490 million was from the Gold Coast acquisition. Our loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 117% to 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined 46 basis points in the quarter, and there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in the second half of this year, as $2.5 billion in time deposits are scheduled to mature with an average cost of 1.57%. With respect to capital, the company announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per share and has maintained its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed the turmoil and have been opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management teams, investments in technology and product development, today, we are better prepared to serve our customers, which will result, hopefully, in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now I\u2019d like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on our results of operations for the quarter.\nSean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.73% quarter-over-quarter despite an elevated average cash position in the second quarter. We continued to benefit from previous Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest-bearing deposits declined 46 basis points during the quarter. Total loan balances increased $76 million quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of $453 million of loans from the acquisition of Gold Coast and $329 million of PPP loans. Deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7% quarter-over-quarter, with noninterest-bearing deposits up $618 million or 26% quarter-over-quarter. Total noninterest income totaled $10.1 million for the quarter, a decline of $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by a $2.6 million MSR write-down, a $1 million reduction in swap income and lower loan and deposit fees as a result of COVID fee relief policies. Excluding $3.3 million of Gold Coast-related costs, expenses totaled $96.7 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $5.8 million or 6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31. Our reported efficiency ratio improved to 52% from 55% in Q1, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a decrease in noninterest expense. Provision for credit losses was $33.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30 compared to $31 million for the 3 months ended March 31. Both periods were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL economic forecast scenarios for the second quarter included a double dip recession scenario where GDP and unemployment further deteriorate in Q4, and unemployment remains in double-digit territory for most of 2022. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we continue through this environment. Non-accrual loans represented 0.59% of total loans at June 30 compared to 0.46% at March 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.37% at June 30. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13% at June 30, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.2 billion. Liquidity improved quarter-over-quarter as our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 110% at quarter end, down from 117% in Q1. Finally, I would like to note that additional information on loan deferrals can be found in an 8-K that we filed last night. Now I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Sean. Our message at the bank is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full-service at regular hours. At the height of the pandemic, we had 48 employee cases. And thank goodness, thank god, today, we do not have any. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 50% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it\u2019s very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch yesterday and listened to their challenges during the height of this pandemic here in New Jersey. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and more importantly, helping their customers and communities through this pandemic. The past 4 months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, which will then impact our economic models, we can have a much stronger second half of 2020. We\u2019ve been aggressive in calling on our loan customers, and have a war room type attitude to monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork from our front-line loan officers and our credit risk team. This crisis is different from 2008\u2019s Great Recession as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain the economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events. And I am much more optimistic than I was in April when there was so much uncertainty. Our medical professionals and healthcare workers have been outstanding. And I\u2019ve learned a lot about the treatment of this virus. And we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. Our earnings per share is flat to last year after taking $36 million in additional provisions in the quarter. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to questions.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey, guys, good morning.\nKevin Cummings: Good morning.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Kevin, I really \u2013 I like your optimism. It\u2019s good to hear. First question I had, you all saw a pretty good drop in deferrals this quarter. I\u2019m just curious, was that borrowers genuinely willing or ready to start making payments again or did it necessitate a fair bit of nudging on your behalf to get them to sort of start making payments again?\nDomenick Cama: Hey, Mark. It\u2019s Domenick.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey, Domenick.\nDomenick Cama: I think \u2013 yeah, I know, I think for the most part the customers were willing to come off the deferrals. But we did put a policy in place in which we made it a little bit tougher to get a second deferral. We asked for income/expense, P&L statements. We\u2019ve looked at their debt service coverage. In some cases, in exchange for getting the second deferral, we would ask them to put up a cash reserve or even put a guarantee on loans. And so, as I said, for the most part, customers were willing to come off. But clearly, our second deferral policy is to be a little tougher and to scrutinize the deferral request a little bit more than we did the first time.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then at that same vein, how are rent payments, particularly on multifamily properties is going recently?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. Mark, I think we\u2019ve been open with this information. I mean, what we\u2019re noticing is not too dissimilar to what we see in the rest of the market. In the multifamily space, I would say that average collections of rents are north of 85%. On the commercial real estate side, I would say that, that number is about 50%. But again, on multifamily, it\u2019s been stronger than commercial real estate.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then, Sean, I\u2019m curious, can you give us a sense for the timing of the excess liquidity deployment? Because I know that obviously is weighing on the margin a bit.\nSean Burke: Yeah, Mark, by quarter end, by June 30, you could see that our cash position had come down nicely from the average balance that you saw during the quarter. So to a large degree, it has come off already. And we\u2019re expecting to kind of have that number, average cash balance in the $500 million range come the end of next quarter. And then by the end of the following quarter, we think we\u2019ll be back to a normalized level from a cash position perspective.\nMark Fitzgibbon: And then, as you think about the margin for the back half of the year, excluding the benefit from PPP that will come in at some point, the core margin up maybe 5, 7 basis points a quarter, is that a reasonable expectation?\nKevin Cummings: Mark, I don\u2019t know if I would completely agree with that. But what I would comment is, we are expecting our margin to be stable with a bias to slightly up through year-end.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cummings: Hey, Jared, are you on mute?\nOperator: Mr. Shaw, are you there? Are you on mute?\nKevin Cummings: We can\u2019t hear you. Hey, Nick, maybe we can go to the next caller and come back.\nOperator: The next question is from Laurie Hunsicker of Compass Point. Please go ahead.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yeah, hi. Thanks, good morning.\nKevin Cummings: Good morning.\nSean Burke: Good morning.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Just around your comments regarding the core margin for the back half of the year, are you including any PPP forgiveness in that? And then can you remind us what the fees on the $329 million are expected to be?\nSean Burke: So the answer is yes. But, Laurie, we only have $329 million of PPP loans. So it really is not that impactful on our margin as a whole. And I think our expectation is, around 75% of that PPP balance, we are expecting that to cure within a year\u2019s period, and then the remainder 25% is going to come in over a 5-year period. So that averages to about a couple of years, at least that\u2019s our assumption that we\u2019re using when we do modeling for margin purposes. But again, Laurie, even if you kind of stripped it out with or without, it probably is very negligible, 1 or 2 basis points impact on the margin.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And so, the PPP fees for that book, they\u2019re around $10 million or do you have a better number?\nSean Burke: That fees were approximately $8 million. So that is the potential. I\u2019ll say if they\u2019re all paid off next week, it\u2019d be $8 million of their interest revenue.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Okay. And then, for the back half of the year, how should we be thinking about expenses? I mean, Gold is closed. Are you thinking about any branch rationalization or any color you can give us there? Thanks.\nDomenick Cama: Laurie, it\u2019s Domenick. Yeah, we are looking at branch rationalization. Obviously, consumers and business customers have taken better hold of online and mobile banking services. So that\u2019s giving us an opportunity to look at our branches to see where we may have some overlap. So, yeah, there\u2019s some branch rationalization that we\u2019re examining for 2020.\nKevin Cummings: Laurie, if we \u2013 we made a comment, we had a discussion last week, if we don\u2019t change the way we do business as a result of this pandemic, we\u2019ve wasted a lot of time, effort and sweat, tears over this last 5 months. So I think there\u2019s going to be significant changes on the horizon as we move forward and customer behaviors change as a result of this pandemic. Luckily, we\u2019re in a position where we made significant investments in our technology and our products. And over the last in 2018 and 2019 with a new Chief Marketing Officer, and that\u2019s paying off for us in spades as we work through this situation.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Okay. And then on to loan modifications, and I really appreciate all your detail. If we were just more high-level thinking about the $2.7 billion that you have as far as active deferrals as of June 30, what is that number looking like as we get closer to August 1 or September 1?\nDomenick Cama: I think, Laurie, the way to think about it is just at a very high level. And Kevin gave the number at about $750 million. So what we\u2019re expecting is, when this is all said and done, that we\u2019ll have about $750 million in deferrals that we\u2019ll be working with.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And that obviously included the big chunk of the $230 million or so of hotels?\nDomenick Cama: Absolutely.\nKevin Cummings: Yes.\nDomenick Cama: Absolutely.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes. So netting that out, it\u2019s a really small number. And then, if you can just help us think about, because you\u2019ve got your hotels and your food service combined, do you have a dollar balance on hotels and a dollar balance on restaurants? Or if not, I can follow-up\u2026\nDomenick Cama: It\u2019s overwhelmingly in favor of the hotels. I mean, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t have an exact dollar amount, Laurie, but it is predominantly hotel.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Okay.\nKevin Cummings: We can get back to you on that number. I think it\u2019s \u2013 like in my mind, it\u2019s like less than $50 million restaurant exposure, it\u2019s much less than that. So we will get back to you offline on that.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then just one last quick question. Your $1.2 billion of office, do you have an LTV on that? Or I can follow up with you on that as well.\nSean Burke: We don\u2019t have it right here, Laurie, but we can get back to you with that information.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert, KBW. Please go ahead.\nCollyn Gilbert: If I could start with expenses, so relative to what we were expecting and even in the second quarter, you guys saw a material drop in expenses this quarter. And I appreciate, Sean, kind of your comments and you too, Dom. But if we just think about this quarter\u2019s expenses, I mean, it kind of run rates to like $395 million or something below. I think, Sean, what you had given is a $435 million guide for the full year of 2020. Can you just talk about kind of the movement there on the expense side? And what will come back maybe in the back half of the year and how that compares to your original OpEx guidance?\nSean Burke: Yeah, look, on the OpEx guide, we were high as it turns out. And I think the largest driver of that is just this pandemic. We just don\u2019t have the type of expenses that we would normally experience when people are traveling and loan officers are out generating loans. And so, I think we\u2019re benefiting from the lack of expenses on that side. As we look through the back half of the year, we don\u2019t have anything, Collyn, necessarily planned. It\u2019s going to meaningfully increase expenses from the base that we\u2019re at now. So I think it\u2019s safe to say that the guide that we\u2019re providing at $435 million, that we\u2019re not going to be at that number. We\u2019re going to be south of that. I was thinking about something in the $410 million range is probably more reasonable level right now. I\u2019d probably have a little bit of buffer in that, too, Collyn, just for some of the unknown as we go through the back half of the year, but nothing planned on the docket that\u2019s going to throw off expenses in the back-half of the year meaningfully.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just in terms of your \u2013 you mentioned kind of the liquidity or the cash usage through the end of the year, Sean. Can you guys just tie that to what you think loan growth will be? And then, within that in terms of like your current loan pipeline and then what you\u2019re seeing in terms of new loan origination yields? And then I have a follow-up to that as well.\nDomenick Cama: Collyn, it\u2019s some \u2013 we\u2019ve just recently opened up our lending to a greater degree. We came into 2020 with a strategic plan intended to reduce residential and multifamily. And certainly, that\u2019s happened and our pipelines were reduced coming into the first quarter. Then the pandemic hit. And I would say that we were more cautious on lending and so did not see a lot of loans closed during the March, April and May timeframe. As credit spreads started to widen, we recognized that we could put on residential and multifamily at a decent spread and which would be \u2013 which would contribute to net interest margin. And so those pipelines now have started to build and right now, we\u2019re looking at a pipeline of about $2.4 billion, if you include $400 million for residential loans. So C&I is about an $800 million pipeline. CRE is about $1.2 billion in pipeline. And I know that\u2019s a long-winded answer to tell you that I\u2019m not really sure where loan growth is going to be. I mean, if I took PPP and I took Gold Coast off the table for a moment, the loan actually declined about $700 million. So I\u2019m hoping that we could get that back and keep the balance sheet stable and neutral for the rest of this year. So having said that, that would mean that I would stay at around the $27 billion mark, as we head into the end of the year.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just \u2013 so on that \u2013 and Sean, your comment on the NIM. I guess, I would be thinking that maybe that NIM would expand a little bit more than what you guys are indicating. Can you just talk about \u2013 so you had mentioned the tranche of CDs that are maturing and coming down? But where your sort of new CD rates are or kind of the fits and starts as to what you\u2019re assuming on the funding side? And the composition of deposits is a big one, too, right, in terms of your outlook for noninterest bearing?\nDomenick Cama: Yeah. The \u2013 Hey, Collyn, it\u2019s Domenick. The \u2013 on the cost of deposits coming in now, I mean, we have a product out there, a money market account that\u2019s tied to our core checking account that requires activities and certain number of online deposits and things like that. And that cost is at 75 basis points right now. That\u2019s what we\u2019re advertising. We have a 13-month product out there at 85 basis points and a 7-month product out there at 60 basis points. And quite honestly, just been talking about it the last few days, we see those numbers as being towards the higher end of the market. So we see that coming down somewhat. But I wanted to go back to Kevin\u2019s comment about the maturing CDs. I mean, it\u2019s significant. It\u2019s close to $1 billion, $900 million. If you look at it through the end of the year with the weighted average cost of, let\u2019s call it, 1.60-ish. And so that should help NIM coming into the third and fourth quarter. As far as our projections in being light on where that is, I mean, clearly, there\u2019s a lot dependent on where NIM is going to go. These cash balances have been a burden on us. To the extent that we continue to shrink, it could mitigate any potential benefit. But on the loan side, I mean, we\u2019re seeing rates between resi and C&I going anywhere from 3 3/8% to 3 5/8%. So that\u2019s \u2013 so if you think about the incremental cost of funds here being somewhere around, let\u2019s call it, 40 to 60 basis points, we\u2019re looking at spreads north of 300 basis points, which will be additive to NIM as we head and go into the third and fourth quarter, obviously, offset by any cash balances that we continue to maintain.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. That\u2019s great color. Thanks for that, Dom. And then just one last question on mortgage banking. It was up nicely this quarter. I guess, just seeing a lot of the activity in the market here. Do you have a sense as to where you think you can take that business line either through just near-term activity and then just structural sort of how you see that building out longer term?\nDomenick Cama: The \u2013 Collyn, our mortgage banking business, I mean, we just had a meeting on this, this morning. I mean, right now, our pipeline is about $400 million, and about 50% of it is slated to be sold to the agencies. It\u2019s amazing to me. We looked at the pricing this morning and 2 7/8% 30-year mortgages can be sold to Fannie at a price of north of 3 points, which when you compare that to where we\u2019ve been historically, let\u2019s say, over the last 18 months, I mean, that spread has \u2013 was about 1.5. So it\u2019s gone from 1.5 to north of 3 over an 18-month period, and the coupons have come down to 2 7/8%. To answer your question in terms of where could this go for us, it\u2019s hard to say. I mean, we\u2019re just trying to \u2013 we\u2019re not out there actively having a mortgage banking business. We\u2019re just trying to manage our own customer base and generate some commissions for our loan officers. So it\u2019s not the type of thing that we\u2019re going to build up or make any significant investment in. We\u2019re just kind of reaping the rewards of the current interest rate environment and the impact it\u2019s having on mortgage banking.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s super helpful. I will leave it there. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Matthew Breese, Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Breese: I appreciate all the detail on the commercial book in terms of deferrals, very encouraging. Could you just talk about deferral trends or expectations for the residential portfolio? And are the cure rates as strong there?\nDomenick Cama: So Matt, that\u2019s a very good point. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve looked at. Actually, it\u2019s not as strong on the residential side as it has been on the commercial side. So on the residential side, we had approximately $600 million of loans that were deferred. And when we look at those that were coming due in July, that totaled approximately $352 million. Of the $352 million, 34% have cured, right. So that\u2019s about $140 million. And 65% have asked for a second deferral. So you can see on the resi side, it\u2019s not as strong as it has been on the commercial side.\nMatthew Breese: Is the process for issuing additional consumer or residential deferrals as strenuous as it is for commercial customers?\nDomenick Cama: It is not as strenuous. What\u2019s happening there, Matt, is we are trying to follow the Fannie guidelines on that. And Fannie\u2019s guidelines don\u2019t push customers to provide the type or the level of detail that we can on the commercial side. So we\u2019re a little hamstrung. Even though these loans are in our portfolio, and I guess, technically, we don\u2019t have to abide by the Fannie guidelines. But I think not abiding by Fannie guidelines would probably hurt us just from a reputation perspective.\nMatthew Breese: Understood. Okay. And then considering the overall deferral comments and trends, and certainly, there\u2019s more positive body language and tone this quarter. Can you just talk about reserve adequacy and the outlook for the provision? And whether you think what we\u2019ve seen these last 2 quarters is what you expect for the back half of the year? Should we expect a reduction in the level of provision?\nKevin Cummings: Well, Matt, some of my commentary on the macroeconomics. You deal with the model now. And it\u2019s a little difficult to forecast that future based on the inputs that may be changing over the next couple of months. We got asked by our regulators in a meeting the other day, and it could be down to $15 million and up to $50 million in the course of that range. It\u2019s a truck \u2013 you can drive truck to the range, and to give guidance on that, in things that really are not in our control based on the life of the loan and the new CECL mandates, it\u2019s very, very difficult to forecast. But I think where we are, I think we feel very comfortable with our reserve today.\nMatthew Breese: Okay. And then my last one is just bigger picture. The last few years, we\u2019ve seen the bank really push towards C&I and more relationship-driven banking. But in times of stress, we\u2019ve heard you talk about adding to the residential and multifamily portfolio. Has everything that\u2019s happened given you any sort of \u2013 have you contemplated maybe a more balanced approach and going back to the multifamily resi business and a little less on C&I. Has that \u2013 any of that changed?\nDomenick Cama: I don\u2019t think so, Matt. I think we continue to \u2013 I think we run a well-diversified portfolio. I mean when you look at the ratios of multifamily loans, they\u2019ve come down. I mean, we have \u2013 at $7.5 billion on multifamily, $5 billion on resi, $3.5 billion on C&I and about $5 billion on CRE. So that\u2019s a pretty balanced book, I think. I mean, from the C&I perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to try to grow that business. I mean because it\u2019s not only the C&I loan that you put on your balance sheet. It\u2019s also the deposit that comes with it, it\u2019s the cash management fees that come with it. And quite frankly, when we compare our returns nationwide to banks in our peer group, and we see banks who are performing better than we are, again, pre-COVID, the one \u2013 the 2 pieces of data that are different in those banks versus our bank is that they have a greater percentage of their loan portfolio in C&I, and they have a greater percentage of their deposits in noninterest-bearing deposits. And so when I look at those 2 factors, they pretty clearly tell me that we can have a better return on equity and a better return on assets if we shift the strategy a little bit here, despite the fact that we\u2019re here in the Northeast.\nMatthew Breese: Yeah. Understood. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jared Shaw, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJared Shaw: Yes. I\u2019ll try this again. Can you hear me?\nDomenick Cama: Hey, Jared. There you are.\nKevin Cummings: There you are.\nJared Shaw: Thanks. So I guess I just wanted to circle back on the loan growth discussion with the headwind of looking at that core sort of number down $700 million this quarter in the pipeline you guys talked about. Are we thinking \u2013 how should we be thinking about the magnitude of loan growth from here? I mean, is it trying to recover that $700 million by the end of the year? Or is that too much, I guess, to think of over the next few quarters with the headwind on the smaller PPP balances?\nDomenick Cama: Yeah. I think that\u2019s a fair assessment of where we want to be. If we can recover that $700 million, I think we would all feel pretty good about it.\nJared Shaw: Okay. And then circling, I guess, back with that provision \u2013 with that growth is the backdrop for the provision. If we don\u2019t see any change in the economic models, then \u2013 I mean, would that \u2013 I guess that would mathematically lead to a significantly lower provision in third and fourth quarter without economic deterioration, without outsized loan growth?\nDomenick Cama: Jared, again, I\u2019d just go back to Kevin\u2019s response earlier. I mean, it\u2019s just so difficult to try to determine even to sit here and presume that there\u2019s a better economy and loan growth. It\u2019s just so hard to say. I mean, the CECL process is completely driven by the use of models that are forecasting the economy. And for us to sit here, try to determine what our provision is, is difficult. And I know it\u2019s difficult for you, because you need to run your models and try to come up with some forecast, but it\u2019s just hard for us to say.\nJared Shaw: Got it. I guess with the model, are you using the Moody\u2019s baseline? It seems like the way you were discussing it, maybe it seemed like there\u2019s a little more of an adverse economic scenario than the straight-line baseline that you\u2019re assuming?\nDomenick Cama: Yeah. So we\u2019re using a combination of the 3 of them, the 3 models, and we are assigning weights to the specific scenario. So we have weights assigned to the S3 version of Moody\u2019s, S1 and what...\nKevin Cummings: And baseline.\nDomenick Cama: And baseline.\nJared Shaw: Okay.\nKevin Cummings: Jared, we\u2019re in a unique situation here, because we\u2019re in a real world without the CARES Act and the change in treating non-paying customers. We would have significant TDRs, troubled debt restructurings, and non-accruals. And it\u2019s amazing that the general market conditions in the stock market, things don\u2019t really take that into account. It\u2019s going to be something like I said earlier, it\u2019s going to be some difficult discussions once this second deferral period ends up, and we might be dealing with, say, anywhere from $300 million to $400 million of loans that might not come off with that hotel group. So we\u2019re already talking with them and working on plans post second deferral. And we\u2019re hopefully going to be in a better position, because we\u2019re proactively reaching out to the customers and tell them, it\u2019s going to be a while before people go into New York City to go to a flight, it\u2019d be a while before people are traveling the way we were pre-pandemic. So when you put all those things together, there\u2019s still some uncertainty, but I think we\u2019re making the best of a tough situation.\nJared Shaw: Yeah. That\u2019s great color. I guess, actually, just one quick \u2013 on the $230 million of those 2 relationships you mentioned, how many properties are incorporated in those \u2013 in that balance?\nKevin Cummings: 8. Yeah, each have 4. Each have 4 locations in New York City.\nJared Shaw: Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Duong, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteven Duong: Hi, good morning, guys.\nDomenick Cama: Good morning.\nKevin Cummings: Hi, Steve.\nSteven Duong: Hey. Just on your footprint, are there any pockets that\u2019s showing more stress than your other areas?\nDomenick Cama: Stress from what perspective?\nSteven Duong: I guess \u2013 from \u2013 I guess, from a credit perspective, just more unusual as opposed to like what you\u2019re seeing generally?\nDomenick Cama: And from a geographic perspective?\nSteven Duong: Yeah. Yeah.\nDomenick Cama: I can\u2019t say that there\u2019s one particular area that has been impacted more than the other. It feels less geographic and more asset class. And I think you could see that, Steve, in our 8-K, right, where you see the deferrals really focused on office and shopping centers, retail CRE and then also the accommodation in hotels, motels. So I think it\u2019s more by industry than it is by geography.\nSteven Duong: Got it. And then just a last one for me. Your treasury management team, are you guys still looking \u2013 are they still out trying to win business? And just how are they doing? How successful has it been?\nDomenick Cama: The treasury management team?\nSteven Duong: Your products, you know...\nDomenick Cama: Yeah. I mean, we\u2019re not out there aggressively trying to win business. Obviously, we have a significant cash position right now. I think what they are trying to do is make sure that current customer base is taken care of, and it\u2019s in line with the market and our own cost of funds is. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re out there aggressively trying to bring deposits in at least on the wholesale side, which is where the treasury management team would be most involved.\nKevin Cummings: Well, anecdotally, Steve, I\u2019ve been out on some calls, a college up in New England, up in Massachusetts, 2 very large not-for-profits, where we won, on one of those not-for-profits we had the business. And we\u2019ve taken out one of the national banks, and the cash management procedures and the deposits are a big part of that product offering to that particular customer, and it\u2019s a sizable loan line of credit of $8 million. And the other 2 situation, one\u2019s a $32 million loan, and the other one is a $40 million loan. And it\u2019s really, we won the business, but it\u2019s a pricing issue on whether we can get to a reasonable return for us dealing with swaps and things like that. So I think the business we\u2019re out there. Our guys \u2013 we recently hired 5 significant well-experienced loan officers. We\u2019ve also continued to build out that business development team that we talked about on previous calls. Both these groups were so helpful in that PPP process, I mean. And we\u2019ve gotten through that with a lot of more experienced bankers. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraging people to get back. We have 50% of our staff back in the corporate offices. And getting back to normalcy is really what we\u2019re striving to do to generate more core deposits. And that gets back to that strategy question before. Like I said, we don\u2019t want to change our strategy but we\u2019re certainly going to be optimistic and take advantage of situations where like multifamily and residential, good credit products are available to us at average yield. And we\u2019re also looking at this opportunity to move out some of our funding for the use of cash flow swaps, and that\u2019s been \u2013 we\u2019ve been opportunistic using some of those tools to lock down some of our funding and become less liability-sensitive as we anticipate rates going up and not going down any further with the Fed position and our position to negative rates.\nSteven Duong: Got it. I appreciate the color. Thank you, guys.\nKevin Cummings: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is a follow-up from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Please go ahead.\nCollyn Gilbert: Hi guys, just a really quick housekeeping question. Sean, on the merger charges, do you have where \u2013 how those broke out in the quarter within each segment?\nSean Burke: I can get you the breakout, Collyn. But it\u2019s primarily 2 categories. One is data processing. So termination, there\u2019s some cost on the Fiserv side, and then also professional fees, banker fee, legal fees. I actually think that\u2019s the bulk, but I can get back to you, Collyn, on the breakout.\nCollyn Gilbert: Okay. Okay. That\u2019s great. All right, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Nick. First of all, I\u2019d like to thank you for your participation today. This may sound strange, but the past 5 months have been an adrenaline rush for me as our Executive Team, as it is \u2013 every day has been an adventure. The days are long, but the weeks fly by, and I\u2019m very proud to be working with our leadership team at the bank and the great team of employees who have stepped up to help various not-for-profits, our customers and just generally people in need. As the famous quote states, adversity and crisis do not build character, they reveal it. And character is the first of our core values, 4Cs: Character, Commitment, Cooperation and Community. And these values and the core values of this country will carry us through this crisis. I know it may look dark with all the disagreements in the world and in Washington, but we need to be faithful and not fearful, hopeful and optimistic. We need to stay healthy and help each other through this time. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow CDC guidelines. So it\u2019s good to say, wear a mask and stay away from crowds.\nSean Burke: And wash your hands.\nKevin Cummings: And wash your hands, right. Let\u2019s pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the very best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And always remember, the journey is the destination. Thanks, again, for your participation today. I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with some of you. Enjoy your summer. Enjoy the baseball season, the basketball and hockey seasons. They\u2019re starting tonight and have started over the past week. It\u2019s another step back to normalcy and let\u2019s continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe and God bless. Have a great day and thank you very much for your participation.\nOperator: Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Domenick Cama",
            "content": "Hey, Mark. It's Domenick. I think \u2013 yeah, I know, I think for the most part the customers were willing to come off the deferrals. But we did put a policy in place in which we made it a little bit tougher to get a second deferral. We asked for income/expense, P&L statements. We've looked at their debt service coverage. In some cases, in exchange for getting the second deferral, we would ask them to put up a cash reserve or even put a guarantee on loans. And so, as I said, for the most part, customers were willing to come off. But clearly, our second deferral policy is to be a little tougher and to scrutinize the deferral request a little bit more than we did the first time. Yes. Mark, I think we've been open with this information. I mean, what we're noticing is not too dissimilar to what we see in the rest of the market. In the multifamily space, I would say that average collections of rents are north of 85%. On the commercial real estate side, I would say that, that number is about 50%. But again, on multifamily, it's been stronger than commercial real estate. Laurie, it's Domenick. Yeah, we are looking at branch rationalization. Obviously, consumers and business customers have taken better hold of online and mobile banking services. So that's giving us an opportunity to look at our branches to see where we may have some overlap. So, yeah, there's some branch rationalization that we're examining for 2020. I think, Laurie, the way to think about it is just at a very high level. And Kevin gave the number at about $750 million. So what we're expecting is, when this is all said and done, that we'll have about $750 million in deferrals that we'll be working with. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's overwhelmingly in favor of the hotels. I mean, I think it's \u2013 we don't have an exact dollar amount, Laurie, but it is predominantly hotel. Collyn, it's some \u2013 we've just recently opened up our lending to a greater degree. We came into 2020 with a strategic plan intended to reduce residential and multifamily. And certainly, that's happened and our pipelines were reduced coming into the first quarter. Then the pandemic hit. And I would say that we were more cautious on lending and so did not see a lot of loans closed during the March, April and May timeframe. As credit spreads started to widen, we recognized that we could put on residential and multifamily at a decent spread and which would be \u2013 which would contribute to net interest margin. And so those pipelines now have started to build and right now, we're looking at a pipeline of about $2.4 billion, if you include $400 million for residential loans. So C&I is about an $800 million pipeline. CRE is about $1.2 billion in pipeline. And I know that's a long-winded answer to tell you that I'm not really sure where loan growth is going to be. I mean, if I took PPP and I took Gold Coast off the table for a moment, the loan actually declined about $700 million. So I'm hoping that we could get that back and keep the balance sheet stable and neutral for the rest of this year. So having said that, that would mean that I would stay at around the $27 billion mark, as we head into the end of the year. Yeah. The \u2013 Hey, Collyn, it's Domenick. The \u2013 on the cost of deposits coming in now, I mean, we have a product out there, a money market account that's tied to our core checking account that requires activities and certain number of online deposits and things like that. And that cost is at 75 basis points right now. That's what we're advertising. We have a 13-month product out there at 85 basis points and a 7-month product out there at 60 basis points. And quite honestly, just been talking about it the last few days, we see those numbers as being towards the higher end of the market. So we see that coming down somewhat. But I wanted to go back to Kevin's comment about the maturing CDs. I mean, it's significant. It's close to $1 billion, $900 million. If you look at it through the end of the year with the weighted average cost of, let's call it, 1.60-ish. And so that should help NIM coming into the third and fourth quarter. As far as our projections in being light on where that is, I mean, clearly, there's a lot dependent on where NIM is going to go. These cash balances have been a burden on us. To the extent that we continue to shrink, it could mitigate any potential benefit. But on the loan side, I mean, we're seeing rates between resi and C&I going anywhere from 3 3/8% to 3 5/8%. So that's \u2013 so if you think about the incremental cost of funds here being somewhere around, let's call it, 40 to 60 basis points, we're looking at spreads north of 300 basis points, which will be additive to NIM as we head and go into the third and fourth quarter, obviously, offset by any cash balances that we continue to maintain. The \u2013 Collyn, our mortgage banking business, I mean, we just had a meeting on this, this morning. I mean, right now, our pipeline is about $400 million, and about 50% of it is slated to be sold to the agencies. It's amazing to me. We looked at the pricing this morning and 2 7/8% 30-year mortgages can be sold to Fannie at a price of north of 3 points, which when you compare that to where we've been historically, let's say, over the last 18 months, I mean, that spread has \u2013 was about 1.5. So it's gone from 1.5 to north of 3 over an 18-month period, and the coupons have come down to 2 7/8%. To answer your question in terms of where could this go for us, it's hard to say. I mean, we're just trying to \u2013 we're not out there actively having a mortgage banking business. We're just trying to manage our own customer base and generate some commissions for our loan officers. So it's not the type of thing that we're going to build up or make any significant investment in. We're just kind of reaping the rewards of the current interest rate environment and the impact it's having on mortgage banking. So Matt, that's a very good point. It's something that we've looked at. Actually, it's not as strong on the residential side as it has been on the commercial side. So on the residential side, we had approximately $600 million of loans that were deferred. And when we look at those that were coming due in July, that totaled approximately $352 million. Of the $352 million, 34% have cured, right. So that's about $140 million. And 65% have asked for a second deferral. So you can see on the resi side, it's not as strong as it has been on the commercial side. It is not as strenuous. What's happening there, Matt, is we are trying to follow the Fannie guidelines on that. And Fannie's guidelines don't push customers to provide the type or the level of detail that we can on the commercial side. So we're a little hamstrung. Even though these loans are in our portfolio, and I guess, technically, we don't have to abide by the Fannie guidelines. But I think not abiding by Fannie guidelines would probably hurt us just from a reputation perspective. I don't think so, Matt. I think we continue to \u2013 I think we run a well-diversified portfolio. I mean when you look at the ratios of multifamily loans, they've come down. I mean, we have \u2013 at $7.5 billion on multifamily, $5 billion on resi, $3.5 billion on C&I and about $5 billion on CRE. So that's a pretty balanced book, I think. I mean, from the C&I perspective, we're going to continue to try to grow that business. I mean because it's not only the C&I loan that you put on your balance sheet. It's also the deposit that comes with it, it's the cash management fees that come with it. And quite frankly, when we compare our returns nationwide to banks in our peer group, and we see banks who are performing better than we are, again, pre-COVID, the one \u2013 the 2 pieces of data that are different in those banks versus our bank is that they have a greater percentage of their loan portfolio in C&I, and they have a greater percentage of their deposits in noninterest-bearing deposits. And so when I look at those 2 factors, they pretty clearly tell me that we can have a better return on equity and a better return on assets if we shift the strategy a little bit here, despite the fact that we're here in the Northeast. Hey, Jared. There you are. Yeah. I think that's a fair assessment of where we want to be. If we can recover that $700 million, I think we would all feel pretty good about it. Jared, again, I'd just go back to Kevin's response earlier. I mean, it's just so difficult to try to determine even to sit here and presume that there's a better economy and loan growth. It's just so hard to say. I mean, the CECL process is completely driven by the use of models that are forecasting the economy. And for us to sit here, try to determine what our provision is, is difficult. And I know it's difficult for you, because you need to run your models and try to come up with some forecast, but it's just hard for us to say. Yeah. So we're using a combination of the 3 of them, the 3 models, and we are assigning weights to the specific scenario. So we have weights assigned to the S3 version of Moody's, S1 and what... And baseline. Good morning. Stress from what perspective? And from a geographic perspective? I can't say that there's one particular area that has been impacted more than the other. It feels less geographic and more asset class. And I think you could see that, Steve, in our 8-K, right, where you see the deferrals really focused on office and shopping centers, retail CRE and then also the accommodation in hotels, motels. So I think it's more by industry than it is by geography. The treasury management team? Yeah. I mean, we're not out there aggressively trying to win business. Obviously, we have a significant cash position right now. I think what they are trying to do is make sure that current customer base is taken care of, and it's in line with the market and our own cost of funds is. But I wouldn't say that we're out there aggressively trying to bring deposits in at least on the wholesale side, which is where the treasury management team would be most involved."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 2.73% quarter-over-quarter despite an elevated average cash position in the second quarter. We continued to benefit from previous Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest-bearing deposits declined 46 basis points during the quarter. Total loan balances increased $76 million quarter-over-quarter, inclusive of $453 million of loans from the acquisition of Gold Coast and $329 million of PPP loans. Deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7% quarter-over-quarter, with noninterest-bearing deposits up $618 million or 26% quarter-over-quarter. Total noninterest income totaled $10.1 million for the quarter, a decline of $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by a $2.6 million MSR write-down, a $1 million reduction in swap income and lower loan and deposit fees as a result of COVID fee relief policies. Excluding $3.3 million of Gold Coast-related costs, expenses totaled $96.7 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease of $5.8 million or 6% compared to the 3 months ended March 31. Our reported efficiency ratio improved to 52% from 55% in Q1, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a decrease in noninterest expense. Provision for credit losses was $33.3 million for the 3 months ended June 30 compared to $31 million for the 3 months ended March 31. Both periods were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our CECL economic forecast scenarios for the second quarter included a double dip recession scenario where GDP and unemployment further deteriorate in Q4, and unemployment remains in double-digit territory for most of 2022. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we continue through this environment. Non-accrual loans represented 0.59% of total loans at June 30 compared to 0.46% at March 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.37% at June 30. Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 13% at June 30, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.2 billion. Liquidity improved quarter-over-quarter as our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 110% at quarter end, down from 117% in Q1. Finally, I would like to note that additional information on loan deferrals can be found in an 8-K that we filed last night. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks. Yeah, Mark, by quarter end, by June 30, you could see that our cash position had come down nicely from the average balance that you saw during the quarter. So to a large degree, it has come off already. And we're expecting to kind of have that number, average cash balance in the $500 million range come the end of next quarter. And then by the end of the following quarter, we think we'll be back to a normalized level from a cash position perspective. Good morning. So the answer is yes. But, Laurie, we only have $329 million of PPP loans. So it really is not that impactful on our margin as a whole. And I think our expectation is, around 75% of that PPP balance, we are expecting that to cure within a year's period, and then the remainder 25% is going to come in over a 5-year period. So that averages to about a couple of years, at least that's our assumption that we're using when we do modeling for margin purposes. But again, Laurie, even if you kind of stripped it out with or without, it probably is very negligible, 1 or 2 basis points impact on the margin. That fees were approximately $8 million. So that is the potential. I'll say if they're all paid off next week, it'd be $8 million of their interest revenue. We don't have it right here, Laurie, but we can get back to you with that information. Yeah, look, on the OpEx guide, we were high as it turns out. And I think the largest driver of that is just this pandemic. We just don't have the type of expenses that we would normally experience when people are traveling and loan officers are out generating loans. And so, I think we're benefiting from the lack of expenses on that side. As we look through the back half of the year, we don't have anything, Collyn, necessarily planned. It's going to meaningfully increase expenses from the base that we're at now. So I think it's safe to say that the guide that we're providing at $435 million, that we're not going to be at that number. We're going to be south of that. I was thinking about something in the $410 million range is probably more reasonable level right now. I'd probably have a little bit of buffer in that, too, Collyn, just for some of the unknown as we go through the back half of the year, but nothing planned on the docket that's going to throw off expenses in the back-half of the year meaningfully. I can get you the breakout, Collyn. But it's primarily 2 categories. One is data processing. So termination, there's some cost on the Fiserv side, and then also professional fees, banker fee, legal fees. I actually think that's the bulk, but I can get back to you, Collyn, on the breakout. And wash your hands."

            "name": "Kevin Cummings",
            "content": "Thank you, Nick, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp's second quarter earnings call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $42.6 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020 as compared to $39.5 million or $0.17 per share for the quarter ended March 31, and $46 million or $0.18 per share for the 3-month period ended June 30, 2019. For the 6 months ended June 30, net income totaled $82.1 million or $0.35 per diluted share compared to $94.8 million or $0.36 per share for the six months ended June 30, 2019. During the quarter, the company completed its acquisition of Gold Coast Bank, which had approximately $535 million in total assets, $443 million in loans and $490 million in deposits. It added 7 branches in the New York market, nearly doubled our deposits in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. These customers have attractive demographics and give us opportunity to leverage our business models to customers in that market. Getting this transaction completed during this pandemic is attributed to the grit and tenacity of the bank, as we closed the transaction, rebranded the branches and completed the data processing conversion during the weekend of April 3. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $12 million in goodwill and approximately $2.5 million in core deposit intangibles. During the second quarter, the company recorded a provision for loan losses of $33.3 million versus $31.3 million in the first quarter of 2020, and this compares to a credit of $3 million in the second quarter of 2019. This elevated provision is a direct result of the current and forecasted economic conditions that include the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-provision net revenue was $92.1 million for the 3 months ended June 30, 2020, an increase of $6.7 million or almost 8% compared to the 3 months ended March 31, 2020. And this is also an increase of $29.8 million or 48% compared to the three months ended June 30, 2019. The bank has spent considerable effort in evaluating its credit position and has focused its effort on the commercial portfolio. As disclosed in our March 31 Q, the company reported approximately $3.6 billion in commercial loan deferrals, comprised of $600 million in C&I loans, $1.4 billion in multifamily loans, and $1.6 billion in CRE. The bank's lending teams were very aggressive reaching out to customers during a time of great stress and uncertainty. And like the PPP loan program, we looked at this deferral process to help our borrowers and customers. We were actively reaching out to them to assist them during this economic lockdown initiated by local governments. We have spent the last 10 weeks actively communicating with our customers to assess their needs during this pandemic. After extensive communications with our borrowers and follow-up on our lending teams, we have reduced the exposures to deferrals significantly. At July 24, total requests and that's different than \u2013 total request for second deferrals totaled $480 million, and which was comprised of $218 million in C&I loans, $87 million in multifamily loans and $175 million in commercial real estate. We have performed detailed reviews on 79% of the original $3.6 billion in deferrals to date. We anticipate on completion of this entire review of deferred loans, a second deferral exposure for commercial loans of approximately $750 million or 5% of commercial loans. As mentioned earlier, of the $480 million in loans that have requested second deferrals, approximately $292 million is concentrated in the accommodations and food services sector. Of that amount, $230 million are hotel loans to 2 relationships who have strong liquidity and are proven generational operators. One relationship had deferred loans with an average LTV pre-COVID of 45% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.85. And the other relationship is also for deferred loans, with an average LTV of 51% and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.42. Both these borrowers have good locations in desirable areas of Manhattan. In the retail sector, we have approximate exposure of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2020, that's the entire commercial portfolio and an initial deferral amount of $880 million, which has been reduced to $380 million by borrowers making their July 1 payment. Based on discussions with borrowers, we expect further reduction upon completion of the initial 3-month deferral period of $258 million, which would result in second deferrals in the retail portfolio of approximately $130 million. In the office sector, our total loan exposure is $1.2 billion, with initial deferrals of $186 million. As of July 22, we have received the July 1 payment for loans totaling $35 million, which results in a current deferral balance of $151 million. Based upon follow-up with our borrowers, we anticipate further reduction of $115 million in the office deferral balances as a result of payments principally scheduled for August 1, which would result in a second deferral balance of approximately $36 million for this sector. In the multifamily sector, we have total exposure of $7.4 billion at June 30, with initial deferrals of $1.4 billion, which have been reduced to $900 million due to payments received in July. We expect those deferrals to be further reduced upon the completion of the initial 3-month deferral period by August and September payments to approximately $100 million. So in summary, today, we have approximately $1.4 billion of loan deferrals in the office, retail and multifamily sectors. We expect, based on current conditions of our borrowers, that those deferral balances will be reduced to $260 million at the end of their initial first 3-month deferral period, which is ending August 1, September 1, and to a limited extent, October 1. Overall, we're very pleased where we are with respect to assisting our customers through this pandemic to date. There is much uncertainty and forecasting future events and results are sometimes very difficult, but we will continue to work with our customers to help them through this crisis. Our approach is to be proactive in addressing these issues as it will be in the future difficult conversations. We believe we have taken a conservative approach to our provisions as compared to banks with similar portfolios in the New York, New Jersey markets, and we are well positioned to weather this storm. With respect to charge-offs for the quarter, we had one significant charge-off on a multifamily loan for $3.5 million that was not pandemic-related. And have had the loan written down to 80% of current appraised value, which was received recently in May. With respect to delinquencies, $15.3 million of the $24 million in multifamily 30-day delinquent loans are current as of today. $6.5 million of the $10.6 million in CRE 30-day delinquencies are current as of today. And $5.9 million of the $7.5 million in C&I 30-day portfolio is current as of today. In the 60-day bucket, the only significant exposure is in the multifamily, which totals $19.1 million, of which $9.9 million is current today. $4.8 million has been approved for its first deferral and $4.4 million is a maturity where there is a contract for sale. In the 90-day bucket, the only significant increase was in the multifamily portfolio, where the reference loan with this quarter's charge-off that now has a carrying value of $18 million was moved into the 90-day delinquent bucket during the quarter. In addition, there were 5 small additional credits with an average balance of $1.4 million, which moved into non-accrual status during the quarter. Based on our current delinquencies and the significant progress in reducing our deferred loan balances, in addition to the increase in our loan reserves in the past 2 quarters, we believe we are well positioned to get through this pandemic. With respect to the balance sheet, loans increased $75 million during the quarter, which was attributable to the Gold Coast acquisition and the origination of approximately $328 million in PPP loans. Without those transactions, loans would have declined by approximately $700 million. With the uncertainty that we are looking at \u2013 with the uncertainty that we were looking at in March and April, it was prudent to take our foot off the accelerator and build liquidity to manage the challenge of this economic environment. As we get a better handle on our exposures to the pandemic economic impact, we will assess our growth opportunities. As the economy continues to stabilize, we will look for opportunities to grow our loans across all portfolios as opposed to our strategy in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, where we were more focused on business lending side. This is not a major strategy shift, but one that will be opportunistic based on current interest rates. It was a strong quarter for deposits as noninterest-bearing deposits increased $618 million or 25% for the quarter, of which $93 million was attributable to Gold Coast. Total deposits increased $1.3 billion or 7%, which \u2013 of which $490 million was from the Gold Coast acquisition. Our loan-to-deposit ratio declined from 117% to 110% for the quarter. Cost of deposits declined 46 basis points in the quarter, and there are still opportunities to decrease funding costs in the second half of this year, as $2.5 billion in time deposits are scheduled to mature with an average cost of 1.57%. With respect to capital, the company announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per share and has maintained its capital ratios across the board given the impact of the PPP loans. We believe we have sufficient capital, strong liquidity and a robust credit culture to maintain that dividend and to handle the uncertainty and economic storm that may be on the horizon. If we look at past calamities like Hurricane Sandy and the 2008 Great Recession, we have managed the turmoil and have been opportunistic. I believe with this management team and with the investments that we have made in our enterprise and credit risk management teams, investments in technology and product development, today, we are better prepared to serve our customers, which will result, hopefully, in stronger returns to our shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the discussion over to Sean Burke, our CFO, for more commentary on our results of operations for the quarter. Okay. Thanks, Sean. Our message at the bank is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities. All our branches are open at full-service at regular hours. At the height of the pandemic, we had 48 employee cases. And thank goodness, thank god, today, we do not have any. We are taking all precautions to protect our customers and employees. We have close to 50% of our corporate employees back to the office, and it's very good for me to see them healthy and strong, willing to return and lead our communities back to some form of normalcy. I visited a branch yesterday and listened to their challenges during the height of this pandemic here in New Jersey. Our retail teams are engaged and excited to be working and more importantly, helping their customers and communities through this pandemic. The past 4 months have not been easy, but we have faced the challenge and continue to get stronger and more adaptable as we navigate the changes from these unprecedented events. If we get some stabilization in the macroeconomic climate, which will then impact our economic models, we can have a much stronger second half of 2020. We've been aggressive in calling on our loan customers, and have a war room type attitude to monitoring our credit exposures with great teamwork from our front-line loan officers and our credit risk team. This crisis is different from 2008's Great Recession as the banking industry is stronger with better capital to sustain the economic downturn. Investors Bank is also stronger and better prepared for these events. And I am much more optimistic than I was in April when there was so much uncertainty. Our medical professionals and healthcare workers have been outstanding. And I've learned a lot about the treatment of this virus. And we are in a better position to monitor and treat this terrible pandemic. Our earnings per share is flat to last year after taking $36 million in additional provisions in the quarter. Our balance sheet and capital are strong, and we are well positioned to grow as the economy improves. Now, I'd like to turn it over to questions. Good morning. Mark, I don't know if I would completely agree with that. But what I would comment is, we are expecting our margin to be stable with a bias to slightly up through year-end. Hey, Jared, are you on mute? We can't hear you. Hey, Nick, maybe we can go to the next caller and come back. Good morning. Laurie, if we \u2013 we made a comment, we had a discussion last week, if we don't change the way we do business as a result of this pandemic, we've wasted a lot of time, effort and sweat, tears over this last 5 months. So I think there's going to be significant changes on the horizon as we move forward and customer behaviors change as a result of this pandemic. Luckily, we're in a position where we made significant investments in our technology and our products. And over the last in 2018 and 2019 with a new Chief Marketing Officer, and that's paying off for us in spades as we work through this situation. Yes. We can get back to you on that number. I think it's \u2013 like in my mind, it's like less than $50 million restaurant exposure, it's much less than that. So we will get back to you offline on that. Well, Matt, some of my commentary on the macroeconomics. You deal with the model now. And it's a little difficult to forecast that future based on the inputs that may be changing over the next couple of months. We got asked by our regulators in a meeting the other day, and it could be down to $15 million and up to $50 million in the course of that range. It's a truck \u2013 you can drive truck to the range, and to give guidance on that, in things that really are not in our control based on the life of the loan and the new CECL mandates, it's very, very difficult to forecast. But I think where we are, I think we feel very comfortable with our reserve today. There you are. And baseline. Jared, we're in a unique situation here, because we're in a real world without the CARES Act and the change in treating non-paying customers. We would have significant TDRs, troubled debt restructurings, and non-accruals. And it's amazing that the general market conditions in the stock market, things don't really take that into account. It's going to be something like I said earlier, it's going to be some difficult discussions once this second deferral period ends up, and we might be dealing with, say, anywhere from $300 million to $400 million of loans that might not come off with that hotel group. So we're already talking with them and working on plans post second deferral. And we're hopefully going to be in a better position, because we're proactively reaching out to the customers and tell them, it's going to be a while before people go into New York City to go to a flight, it'd be a while before people are traveling the way we were pre-pandemic. So when you put all those things together, there's still some uncertainty, but I think we're making the best of a tough situation. 8. Yeah, each have 4. Each have 4 locations in New York City. Hi, Steve. Well, anecdotally, Steve, I've been out on some calls, a college up in New England, up in Massachusetts, 2 very large not-for-profits, where we won, on one of those not-for-profits we had the business. And we've taken out one of the national banks, and the cash management procedures and the deposits are a big part of that product offering to that particular customer, and it's a sizable loan line of credit of $8 million. And the other 2 situation, one's a $32 million loan, and the other one is a $40 million loan. And it's really, we won the business, but it's a pricing issue on whether we can get to a reasonable return for us dealing with swaps and things like that. So I think the business we're out there. Our guys \u2013 we recently hired 5 significant well-experienced loan officers. We've also continued to build out that business development team that we talked about on previous calls. Both these groups were so helpful in that PPP process, I mean. And we've gotten through that with a lot of more experienced bankers. And that's why we're encouraging people to get back. We have 50% of our staff back in the corporate offices. And getting back to normalcy is really what we're striving to do to generate more core deposits. And that gets back to that strategy question before. Like I said, we don't want to change our strategy but we're certainly going to be optimistic and take advantage of situations where like multifamily and residential, good credit products are available to us at average yield. And we're also looking at this opportunity to move out some of our funding for the use of cash flow swaps, and that's been \u2013 we've been opportunistic using some of those tools to lock down some of our funding and become less liability-sensitive as we anticipate rates going up and not going down any further with the Fed position and our position to negative rates. Thank you. Okay. Thanks, Nick. First of all, I'd like to thank you for your participation today. This may sound strange, but the past 5 months have been an adrenaline rush for me as our Executive Team, as it is \u2013 every day has been an adventure. The days are long, but the weeks fly by, and I'm very proud to be working with our leadership team at the bank and the great team of employees who have stepped up to help various not-for-profits, our customers and just generally people in need. As the famous quote states, adversity and crisis do not build character, they reveal it. And character is the first of our core values, 4Cs: Character, Commitment, Cooperation and Community. And these values and the core values of this country will carry us through this crisis. I know it may look dark with all the disagreements in the world and in Washington, but we need to be faithful and not fearful, hopeful and optimistic. We need to stay healthy and help each other through this time. I want you all to please stay healthy and follow CDC guidelines. So it's good to say, wear a mask and stay away from crowds. And wash your hands, right. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other in our daily work and look for magical moments to help each other to be the very best version of ourselves during this crisis as we make this journey together. And always remember, the journey is the destination. Thanks, again, for your participation today. I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with some of you. Enjoy your summer. Enjoy the baseball season, the basketball and hockey seasons. They're starting tonight and have started over the past week. It's another step back to normalcy and let's continue to pray for a cure to this dreadful virus. Be strong, be safe and God bless. Have a great day and thank you very much for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Call. Today all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's event is being recorded. We will begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc., may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investor Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements. In last night's press release, the company included its Safe Harbor disclosure and refers you to that statement. This document is incorporated into this presentation. For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the section entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investor Bancorp's filings with the SEC. Today, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and CEO of Investors Bancorp.\nKevin Cummings: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp first quarter earnings conference call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 versus $48.7 million or $0.19 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $48.2 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31 last year. But I must say that the historical results have less meaning in today's environment as we deal with the economic uncertainty and much more serious issues of health and safety as we manage through this unprecedented pandemic. Right now, our priority is protecting everyone's health and well-being: our employees, customers, vendors and the communities where we work. Our pandemic crisis management team meets daily and includes the entire executive management team, plus key members of credit, operational, compliance and cyber risk management, where we discuss issues and topics ranging from employee health issues and technology to capital and liquidity management. We are focused on operating with a strong liquidity position as we are maintaining an above-average cash balance at quarter end. We continue to maintain a robust capitalization by limiting balance sheet growth and foregoing share buy backs. Excess capital and liquidity plus a fortress balance sheet will serve us well through these uncertain times. Credit topics include asset quality, portfolio analysis and adherence to and revisions to credit policies to meet the current environment. It should be noted that our loan portfolio's past performance has been very strong, and we are well-positioned entering this cycle. Our net charge offs over the past three years have averaged just 4 basis points and 5 basis points over the last 5 years. Our loan portfolio has a lower risk profile compared to our peers as almost 60% of our loans are in the residential space in the multifamily and residential mortgages portfolio. Total net charge offs for the multifamily and mortgage loan portfolios for the 5 years ended 12/31/19, were less than $1 million in total and $22 million for the residential portfolio, respectively. In the first quarter of this year, net charge off totaled $615,000 for these two portfolios. Our average LTVs at year end were approximately 60% for the residential and multifamily portfolios and 55% for the CRE and consumer portfolios. Our weighted average debt service coverage ratio for the multi portfolio, excluding co-op loans, was 1.38x and 1.61x for the CRE portfolio. Our FICO scores for the residential and consumer loan portfolios was 749 and 731, respectively at year-end. Credit quality has been our focus and will continue to be our strength as we move through the crisis. We hope for the best but are prepared for the storm and have placed little reliance on any of the economic predictions that we hear in the news or from the co-experts. No one knows where this crisis will go and we will continue to be diligent in our management by being prudent in our judgments and adhering to our core values and serving our customers and communities as a good corporate citizen. All banking services remain available to our customers in the retail network as branches remain open with drive-thru and ATMs and by appointment in the branches. Our digital channels allow customers to transact remotely and our call center has been staffed up to ensure that we are able to assist our customers in a timely manner. Last week, our average wait time at the call center was two minutes and was as low as 25 seconds. And our call drop rate was as low as 2% over the past week with a daily average under 10%. We have waived the number of consumer fees for up to 90 days and that includes but are not limited to ATM monthly maintenance and overdraft fees. Additionally, we are allowing our customers to defer mortgage payments for up to 90 days due to the financial hardships caused by this crisis. We have deferred monthly mortgage payments for approximately 1,600 customers with a total balance of $648 million with an average balance of $400,000. On the commercial side, we've been proactive in reaching out to our customers to help them through this crisis. Our C&I portfolio has deferments on 299 loans for a total balance of $580 million or 19%. Total impact on cash flow was approximately $18 million over the 90-day period. For the multifamily portfolio, deferments totaled $1.2 billion on 227 loans for an average loan of $5.3 million and the CRE portfolio had deferments totaling $1.3 billion on 305 loans with an average balance of $4.3 million. The total payment deferments amounts were $12 million and $20 million for the multi and CRE portfolios over the 90-day deferment period. At year end, for the multifamily and CRE customers with deferments, the average debt service coverage was 1.69x and 1.47x respectively. For the CRE and multifamily, the average LTV on deferred loans was approximately 53% for both portfolios. We have been active working with the public, not-for-profit space and the private sectors to meet the needs of our customers and our community. Overall, banks through this crisis have played a significant role to act as a conduit between the government and our customers. In an unprecedented role, banks have stepped into provide the process and the manpower to disperse billions of relief to small businesses throughout New Jersey and throughout the country. Government could not get this done alone, but it is a public-private partnership to help businesses in need. And I certainly hope that this program, although not perfect, does not come back to haunt the industry when the time passes and people on the sidelines in Washington question the decisions made in the heat of this battle. Investors Bank, without an SBA platform was able to build a digital platform working with the fintech partners and it was and it certainly was not an easy process. It was a difficult time and probably not our finest hour, but the team worked diligently and was able to execute with the SBA, satisfying our entire pipeline with current SBA approvals of approximately $335 million for 1,850 customers. We were very prudent in our expectations here as we did not want to over promise or under deliver with our customers. Investors Bank and the industry as a whole has worked around the clock to assist the Treasury and the SBA in providing relief to small businesses throughout the country. It was our civic duty to get this done, and I'm very proud of our perseverance and grit and the personal sacrifices of our teams made to support our customers. It has not been easy, but like the fear experienced during the initial outbreak of this pandemic in the New York metropolitan area, we have overcome many obstacles in the workplace, including technology challenges, working from home and caring for the families of the employees and friends who were lost to this coronavirus. We are at the epicenter of this crisis and we have the team to manage through these many problems. From the very beginning, we stepped up our cleaning protocols in the branches and corporate locations as per the CDC guidelines. Since early March, all employees have been dispersed and are either working from home or in other ISBC locations, including key operating functions such as wires, treasury, call center and executive management with the majority of our back office employees working from home. Those employees who remain on-site are practicing social distancing with limited in-person meetings and travel. Health benefits have been expanded for our employees through the employee assistance program, the waiving of co-pays and all telemedicine visits. Through all this calamity, we were able to close our acquisition of Gold Coast Bank on April 3, adding seven branches to our Long Island franchise with $488 million in deposits and $453 million in loans. Our legal team did an outstanding job working with the bankers and Gold Coast CEO, John Tsunis and his management team to close this deal when others may have postponed or walked away from the transaction. I'd like to thank our GC, Brian Doran, Chief Technology Officer, Chris Blotto and Facilities Director, Joe Valente, by getting this deal closed, completing the systems conversion in the weekend and changing the interior and exterior signages to the Investors Bank brand all on a weekend through difficult circumstances to say the least. We wish to welcome the Gold Coast customers and employees to the Investors family. And as part of this transaction and in consultation with its Chairman, John Tsunis, we made $100,000 donation to the Stony Brook University Hospital to assist their workers as the hospital built 1,000-bed temporary mesh-like hospital on the football field of the university. We've been very busy supporting the healthcare workers and the not-for-profits in our community. Early on in March, we allocated to the retail branches and their staff $150,000 budget to invest in the community with meals for elderly customers who may be homebound, donation to food pantries, purchase of air purification machines for the New York Hospital, gift cards for medical workers and many other acts of kindness and hope in a time of uncertainty and despair. Our foundation has made disbursements of $820,000 to food banks, health providers, youth services, homeless shelters, housing and supporting the underserved in our communities. We have made grants for economic support of small businesses of $125,000. The bank and foundation have also added additional funding to local charities, foundations and the community of $190,000 to support local not-for-profits and retail and small businesses in need during this crisis. In this time of uncertainty, it is time for the private sector to support our communities and show the country the generosity of the banking industry as the heart of capitalism in our society. Coming into this pandemic, we think we have a strong balance sheet, excess liquidity and stellar credit quality and are well positioned to weather this storm. We have strong liquidity at our parent company. And at the Board meeting this week, a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share was approved, payable in May. Based on today's forecast, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain this dividend going forward. We had great momentum coming off a strong fourth quarter and executing the Blue Harbour transaction at year end. January and February were probably the best two months for their earnings in the history of the company as we earned before the March Fed cuts $38.6 million for the two months ended February 29. We are in another world, though today as we navigate this pandemic and look forward to getting back to some sense of normalcy. With respect to credit quality, our loan loss reserve increased to $243 million, which is 1.14% of total loans at March 31. Our provision was $31.2 million for the quarter, which includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. I estimate that approximately $24 million to $26 million of this provision is related to this economic and health crisis. Our non-accrual loans totaled $98 million, down from last year at March 31 by 17%, but up slightly from year end by $3 million. The increase from year end is due to one business loan for $5 million, which matured in December 2019 and has not been renewed. At this time, we believe we are well collateralized and no loss is expected. Our allowance for loan losses coverage ratio to non-accrual loans is 248%, up from 200% at this time last year. During the quarter, we had one significant charge-off of $8 million on a loan in our leveraged lending portfolio, which was not meeting its cash flow projections and was in a sales process with an investment banker that failed due to the pandemic crisis. This portfolio totals $264 million with 23 borrowers at March 31, with one borrower over $20 million. Three loans are currently in the deferral process, with two making their first quarter interest payment and one making a partial interest payment. Our 30-day delinquencies were up in the multifamily portfolio by $12.3 million, and the three largest loans for approximately $45 million have made their March payments. In the CRE portfolio, the increase relates to one loan for $20 million to a significant investor that has over $20 million invested in a Manhattan property. We are monitoring all these loans closely considering the economic environment. Total deposits increased $324 million for the quarter as the cost of deposits decreased 20 basis points as we reacted quickly to the pandemic by increasing our liquidity, by increasing cash and due from banks by $500 million at quarter end. Capital liquidity and reserves are key factors as we navigate through this crisis. As rates have come down, we felt it prudent to invest in building our liquidity reserves at the expense of some earnings to be better prepared for the uncertain future. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the worst but hoping for the best. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sean, our CFO, who will give some additional color on our operating results for the quarter. Sean?\nSean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. Earnings before income taxes and provision for credit losses were $85.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $3 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter and an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While net loan balances decreased quarter-over-quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $104.2 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.71% quarter-over-quarter with majority of the increase occurring on a core basis. We continue to benefit from Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest bearing deposits declined 20 basis points to 1.39% from the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income totaled $14.7 million for the quarter, a decline of $5.8 million quarter-over-quarter. We recorded elevated swap and equipment finance fees in the fourth quarter and saw both return to more normalized levels in the first quarter. Expenses totaled $102.6 million for the three months ended March 31, a decrease of $4.3 million or 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019. The efficiency ratio improved to 54.6% from 56.5% in Q4, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in non-interest expense. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the company recorded an increase in allowance for credit losses of $11.7 million. Provision for credit losses was $31.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time we closed the books in early April, our forecast scenarios included a second quarter GDP decline of up to nearly 25% and unemployment up to 13% and a U-shape recovery. Given the uncertainty on how the pandemic will unfold generally makes projecting provision difficult. That being said, our provision in the second quarter will be driven in large part by the expected duration and severity of the pandemic. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we headed into this pandemic. Non-accrual loans represented 0.46% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.44% at December 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.22% at March 31. Our Common Equity Tier one ratio was 13.1% at quarter end, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, all of our regulatory ratios were meaningfully above well-capitalized levels at quarter end. Liquidity is robust and improved quarter-over-quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 117% at quarter end, down from 122% at year end and our access to borrowing facilities and other liquidity sources totaled over $9 billion at March 31. The unprecedented environment makes it difficult to provide formal guidance at this time. As such, we are withdrawing our previous provided earnings guidance. That said, at a high level, we expect our margin to continue to benefit from declining deposit costs in the near term and the loan growth will remain muted given the economic backdrop and our focus on profitability, but could change based on business conditions. Expenses generally are expected to be in line with previous guidance. Finally, we will be providing some additional details on deferrals and loan balances by industry type, referenced by Kevin today, in our 8-K that gets filed with our press release. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Okay, Sean. Thank you. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in the community and continue to live by our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of uncertainty. We are here for our customers. We are partnering with both the not-for-profit sector and the government sectors to help our communities. We have had our challenges, but as of today, we have executed on the task and the projects that this pandemic has created. Working from home, communications with both employees and customers, technology changes and enhancements, cybersecurity, the Gold Coast acquisition, commercial and mortgage loan deferrals, building a platform for the SBA program and leading our teams during a period of uncertainty and fear all have come with unique problems and adjustments. The bank has accomplished these things because of the hard work and leadership of our executives. At times, it may seem overwhelming, but we are getting it done. We will work continue to work together and encourage, now inspire our teams to reach into the depth of their souls to get through this crisis and clear those obstacles in front of us. We do not plan to survive, but we will strive through this crisis and rise to be the best that we can be. The bank will be a source of inspiration during these times because it is through inspiration and encouragement that brings great execution, success and peace in your life. Our communities and customers need us now more than ever. We will continue to step up and face these challenges. Our leaders continue to inspire each other to our greatest moments, knowing that we are giving our best and leaving all our energy on the field. It is a war out there and we will not be victims of this virus, but we will be victors. Now I'd like to turn the call over to some questions. Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nMark Fitzgibbon: So I wondered, first, if it would be possible to give us a little bit of detail on the size of things like your hotel, restaurant and retail portfolios.\nDomenickCama: Okay. Yes, Mark, I can help you there. Our accommodation and food business is about 2% of total loans, about $387 million. That's the largest concentration that we have there. Arts, entertainment and recreation about $66 million combined between C&I and CRE. And a real the big number, obviously, is in retail, given our commercial real estate portfolio. That's $1.885 billion, making up about 9% of the portfolio. So those are the biggest concentrations we have. As Sean said, we'll be filing along with the press release and our 8-K a more detailed description of these numbers.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then as you look at your portfolio in its entirety, I know everything is under pressure, but what is it that you're most concerned about? What which segments of the portfolio or borrower types that have you most concerned?\nDomenickCama: I mean obviously in the C&I space, that obviously has a lot of concern. Less concern in the multifamily space, I mean, given the fact that that's an $8 billion portfolio and our resi portfolio is about $5 billion, a little less concern there. On the CRE space, obviously, with the shopping centers, that also poses some concern. We feel pretty good, though, that just given where we operate and given the strength of some of our borrowers and some of the loans and Kevin cited the LTVs and the debt service coverage ratios, although those debt service coverage ratios don't mean much right now, that when as we go and trend and go through this pandemic and as things start to transition back to more normal state. We feel that those portfolios, the CRE, multi-family and resi portfolios, will behave well. Again, there's some doubt on the C&I portfolio, but given some of our exposures there, we also we feel pretty good there. We happen to have Rich Spengler, who's our Chief Lending Officer, on the phone and he may be able to add a little bit more color. Rich?\nRichSpengler: Yes, Dom. Look, I think you pretty much covered it. I think we're looking at predominantly our retail, the commercial real estate and depending upon the duration and when this actually comes back, it seems like that's where there's been the most noise as far as tenant sending in letters and refusing to pay and talking about what time they will actually start making payments again after the pandemic is lifted.\nMark Fitzgibbon: And then, I guess, I was curious on commercial line utilization rates. Have you seen much of an up tick there thus far?\nDomenick Cama: Have not, actually. We were monitoring that very closely, as you may imagine. And we had a little up tick in it and then it flattened out. So the unused lines haven't been a concern to us.\nMark Fitzgibbon: And then, lastly, I heard what you said about provisioning guidance being really difficult given the uncertainties in the environment. Obviously, it's even harder from our perspective to model that out, but as you think about it, say, for the second quarter, would your presumption be that we'd probably see a provision that's somewhat less than what we saw in the first quarter?\nDomenick Cama: Sean, why don't you take that?\nSean Burke: Yes, Mark. I know what you're hinting at, but it really is hard to predict. I mean things change daily. And I certainly understand where you're going there. And it certainly feels like things are getting better. But I think we'd be a little reluctant to really venture out saying that in absolute terms., so for now, the environment changes. I think it's safe to say if things improve and the economic environment improves, I think your statement will hold true. If things deteriorate in some way, then we could be looking at elevated provisions. So we'll go the way the economy goes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris O'Connell with KBW.\nChris O'Connell: Filling in for Collyn. I guess if we could start out with the NIM. You guys had great NIM movement this quarter and good movement on the interest-bearing deposits downward. CDs are still fairly high at 1.88% in terms of the cost. Could you maybe give a look into what CD rates are coming on today and also where borrowings could reprice, given that they're still fairly elevated as well at 2.09% cost?\nDomenick Cama: Yes, Chris. On the CD pricing, we're seeing new CDs come on at a top rate of 1.05% in using a 13-month maturity and 1% in a 7-month maturity. So those are our highest rates these days. I mean we have some programs that require checking accounts that will allow you, if you bring $0.5 million into bringing 1.25. But let's call the highest rates of 1.05% in the CD space. So I mean, those CDs, that 1.88% is obviously elevated because of the fact that rates were so high going through most of 2019. And as rates come down, those CDs will start to reprice more quickly. I think more reflective of our cost of deposits is our government deposit portfolio, which is about $5 billion. So let's call it, $4.5 billion and tied directly to Fed funds. And we've seen those rates come down by about 100 basis points, most of which we'll recognize the benefit of in the second quarter because the first rate cut happened on March 3. We took that right away. And the second rate cut, which occurred on March 15, we decided to wait until April 1. So I think you'll start to see that CD bucket come down. You'll start to see it. You start to see that CD bucket come down, but more importantly, that government deposit bucket has already come down significantly.\nChrisO'Connell: Got it. And so as we look into the 2Q NIM, I mean, is it fair to say given that government deposit bucket combined with what presumably will be a decent drop in borrowings in CDs that we could see double-digit NIM increase next quarter?\nDomenick Cama: I'll let Sean, why don't you handle that?\nSean Burke: I wouldn't go so far as to say double-digit, but certainly, we are expecting to see some NIM expansion next quarter driven by lower deposit costs, lower borrowing costs.\nChris O'Connell: Got it. And I know you guys are kind of backing away from numerical guidance. But as we look into the back half of the year, is it also fair to say that we should see kind of consistent NIM improvement, obviously, 2Q will be fairly material given the government deposit move. But let's say, rates hold in general and loan spreads hold where they are. Is that a fair statement to say for the back half of 2020?\nSean Burke: Yes. There's a lot of moving pieces there. But if we held everything else constant, that's going on, which is kind of a bold statement. But if everything else was constant and we saw borrowings costs are coming down and deposit costs continuing to come down in the lower environment. Yes, that should translate into improved NIM throughout the year. But things are moving around all over the place and it's really hard to predict. So that's why we're backing off a bit going too far out trying to make projections.\nChris O'Connell: Got it. And along the same line, I mean, obviously, liquidity cash built up a ton this quarter. I guess is there a plan or a tentative plan to for how long that might stay on the books?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I think, Chris, along those lines, we have a number of maturities happening in the second quarter and we'll lay some of that off there. We're going to hold on to the cash for a little while to see how our government deposit portfolio behaves during the second quarter. The government deposit bucket runs in cycles, and we just want to make sure that it continues to run in the similar cycle that it has in the past. So we're going to be cautious holding on to the balances, but we recognize that we have a lot of excess cash on the balance sheet and we'll be prudent about how we work it off during the second quarter.\nChris O'Connell: Got it. And then just one last one. On the buyback, I know it's kind of in limbo right now or suspended just given the current environment. What I guess, you guys are still kind of lying above, I guess, what your target TCE ratio longer term. When would you feel comfortable or what would drive you to get back involved with the share repurchases?\nDomenick Cama: Chris, interesting. Sean and I did a conference early in March and it was up and this is before we knew the world was blowing up and a lot of questions about the repurchases. And I just want to remind you that we did a big repurchase in the fourth quarter of 2019 when we bought back over $300 million of Blue Harbour stock. And while the stock price came down and it seemed beneficial to start buying it back, we're dealing, as I said that day a number of times with a number of constituents, right? I mean we have our regulators to deal with. We have our concentration ratios to deal with. And when you buy back $300 million in of stock in one fell swoop, I think it's time to put it on pause and say, \"Hey, let's see how this goes\". As it turned out, it was a good move, not buying any stock back in the first quarter, as we felt it was prudent to shore up capital and make sure capital remained in a strong position. And so I'm going to say also, like Sean said to an earlier question, it's who knows what's going on out there. So I don't see buy backs happening in the foreseeable future, all things being equal as the environment exists today.\nKevin Cummings: Yes. I think our number 1 concern is to protect the dividend moving forward. And buy backs are going to take a backseat. We've always managed capital on a 4-pronged approach; M&A, organic growth, buybacks and dividends. And it's always been our prudent approach of balancing those things, using them when available. I know the stock price is down, but it's certainly not a time in the foreseeable future to jump into that part of the strategy to manage our capital.\nOperator: The next question comes from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point. Please proceed.\nLaurie Hunsicker: I wanted to go back to and I appreciate all the details that you've given, really, really helpful. I wanted to go back to the hotel and restaurant exposure of $387 million. How much of that is CRE versus C&I? And then what's the LTV on the CRE piece, if you have it?\nDomenick Cama: On the C&I piece, it's about $280 million and the CRE piece about $109 million. I don't have the LTV, but I think they're pretty low.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. And then you have the breakout of...\nDomenick Cama: Just one other point, Laurie, I just want to be clear on this. On the C&I front, the $280 million, recognize that those loans are secured by the properties in New York City. So while they're not technically classified and while they are under CRE, we made the loans based on the cash flow of the buildings, but the collateral is real estate. So we feel we're pretty well collateralized in those loans.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Got it. And then do you have the breakout of what hotel versus restaurants?\nDomenick Cama: I don't. We don't have that. The way we've broken this out is accommodation and food service together, but I'm going to say that the majority of it is in the hotel business.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Okay. And then same question on the arts and entertainment, the $66 million, is that primarily C&I or is there any CRE there?\nDomenick Cama: That's primarily C&I. It's about -- it's $47 million on C&I and $19 million on CRE.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And then same question on, go ahead.\nDomenick Cama: On the accommodation, our hotel and food service, $278 million is C&I, $109 million is CRE.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. That's great. And then same question on the retail exposure, the $1.9 billion. Is what percentage or what dollar amount is C&I versus CRE?\nDomenick Cama: $90 million C&I.\nKevin Cummings: And $1.8 billion, $1.795 billion CRE.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And you don't happen to have the LTV on that, do you?\nKevin Cummings: Well, we gave the in my remarks, we gave the overall CRE on the deferments. And I believe it was about 55%. I'll check it, okay?\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. 55%. Okay, great. And then just on that $1.9 billion, is there any mall exposure in there?\nDomenick Cama: Rich, do you have an answer to that?\nRich Spengler: It's predominantly retail shopping not interior malls, more just exterior community-type shopping centers.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. So sort of more retail service. Is that a fair statement?\nRich Spengler: Yes. Exterior anchored supermarkets, big boxes, not large interior malls.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then, do you have and if you don't have this, I'll follow-up with you afterwards, but do you have any dollar amount on exposure in healthcare, education or transportation, any of those three categories?\nDomenick Cama: We do. Laurie, we can answer the question now, but it will be included in the 8-K.\nLaurie Hunsicker: It will. Okay. I'll wait for that. That's helpful.\nDomenick Cama: Yes. The healthcare and social assistance is about $600 million, $650 million and education, about $80 million. And the LTV on CRE deferments is approximately 53%.\nLaurie Hunsicker: 53%. Okay, great. And then I just wanted to go, Kevin, I'm so sorry, I think I must have missed part of this. When you were going through the lower-risk portfolios, the single-family, multifamily and home equity, the LTVs on those three buckets are what again?\nKevin Cummings: Okay. One second.\nLaurie Hunsicker: And while you're looking that up, I go ahead.\nDomenick Cama: $1.1 billion was, I think, also 53%.\nKevin Cummings: Yes.\nDomenick Cama: It was approximately 60%, I believe. We didn't give it on the deferments. It's approximately our average LTVs at year end were approximately 60% for the residential and multifamily portfolios and overall 55% for the CRE and consumer portfolios.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, great. And then just super quick question. Swap fee income I know was down this quarter. What do you have a dollar number on that?\nDomenick Cama: On the swap fee income?\nSean Burke: Yes. Laurie, it's Sean. We're down -- I'm going to look it up, but I think it was down $2.9 million, Laurie, quarter-over-quarter. So the fourth quarter had some elevated swap-throughs this quarter a little bit lighter than what we normally expect. So a little bit on the light end, but the fourth quarter had some elevation in terms of what was in there.\nDomenick Cama: $2.2 million.\nLaurie Hunsicker: $2.2 million?\nDomenick Cama: Difference, yes.\nSean Burke: Difference.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Perfect. I'll leave it there. Thank you so much for all the details.\nDomenick Cama: Laurie, I'm sorry, it's $2.8 million.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.\nJared Shaw: So there are not too many questions left, but on the could you give us a spot rate on deposits at 3/31?\nDomenick Cama: What does that mean, Jared, spot rate?\nJared Shaw: Not the average rate for the quarter, just where cost of deposits were at March 31.\nSean Burke: Jared, I don't have the spot rate, but I can tell you the month of March. So at least for interest bearing deposits, the cost of interest bearing deposits for the month of March was 1.29%.\nJared Shaw: Okay, great. And then we get the impact from government funds that hit in April 1 and 2 that would help bring that down. Can you give a little update on the multifamily line? What you're seeing as loans come to the end of the fixed period, are you seeing sort of continuous renewals or renewals continuing to happen and what's the rate on those renewals now on the multifamily product?\nDomenick Cama: Rich, why don't you handle that?\nRich Spengler: Yes. We're still seeing activity on people looking to refi when they're getting to the end of that fixed period. There's is a good chunk of the current pipeline that we are seeing. We've enhanced some underwriting relative to how we underwrite those deals at this time. But I would say that's probably the busiest part of the marketplace is the refi of loans that are maturing or loans that are rolling as well as anyone that was involved in 1031. Those are probably the two biggest drivers of that marketplace. And 5-year paper is probably somewhere right around that 4% or just below right now today.\nJared Shaw: Okay. And then are you taking on new customers in that line or are you just refing the existing relationships?\nRichSpengler: I would say the bulk of the work is done with existing relationships, but we're still looking at new customers. The majority is all existing.\nJared Shaw: Okay. And then on the broader CRE portfolio, how is the paydown and payoff activity trending since sort of the back end of the quarter? And should we expect to see that slow down as we go in the second and third quarter?\nDomenick Cama: Customers are still paying off their loans. We did see a couple of big payoffs, Jared, in the back end of the first quarter. I think it will slow down as we get through the second quarter just because there are not a lot of new deals happening. As Rich said, most of the deals that are happening are loans that are up to maturity or guys that need to put their money to work in a 1031 exchange. But we don't see a lot of activity in the purchase market. So we expect that, that will slow down, although, as I said, we did see some big payoffs toward the end of March.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Okay. Thanks, Chris. I'd like to thank you for your participation today. When I think about the past two months, I am grateful for the leadership team that I work with and all the employees at the bank. Through great hardship and personal sacrifice, they've done a great job. They continue to amaze me, and I'm humble to leave them with Dom and the executive team. As Churchill once said, \"Fear is a reaction, and courage is a decision.\" Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities and continue to live our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of great stress and uncertainty. Please stay healthy out there. Be careful, and follow the CDC guidelines. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other that we can all be safe and the very best versions of ourselves during this crisis as we make the journey together. I want to thank you again for participating today, and please be careful, and I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with all of you soon. Have a great day, stay healthy and be strong. Talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Yes, Mark, I can help you there. Our accommodation and food business is about 2% of total loans, about $387 million. That's the largest concentration that we have there. Arts, entertainment and recreation about $66 million combined between C&I and CRE. And a real the big number, obviously, is in retail, given our commercial real estate portfolio. That's $1.885 billion, making up about 9% of the portfolio. So those are the biggest concentrations we have. As Sean said, we'll be filing along with the press release and our 8-K a more detailed description of these numbers. I mean obviously in the C&I space, that obviously has a lot of concern. Less concern in the multifamily space, I mean, given the fact that that's an $8 billion portfolio and our resi portfolio is about $5 billion, a little less concern there. On the CRE space, obviously, with the shopping centers, that also poses some concern. We feel pretty good, though, that just given where we operate and given the strength of some of our borrowers and some of the loans and Kevin cited the LTVs and the debt service coverage ratios, although those debt service coverage ratios don't mean much right now, that when as we go and trend and go through this pandemic and as things start to transition back to more normal state. We feel that those portfolios, the CRE, multi-family and resi portfolios, will behave well. Again, there's some doubt on the C&I portfolio, but given some of our exposures there, we also we feel pretty good there. We happen to have Rich Spengler, who's our Chief Lending Officer, on the phone and he may be able to add a little bit more color. Rich? Have not, actually. We were monitoring that very closely, as you may imagine. And we had a little up tick in it and then it flattened out. So the unused lines haven't been a concern to us. Sean, why don't you take that? Yes, Chris. On the CD pricing, we're seeing new CDs come on at a top rate of 1.05% in using a 13-month maturity and 1% in a 7-month maturity. So those are our highest rates these days.

It's about -- it's $47 million on C&I and $19 million on CRE. On the accommodation, our hotel and food service, $278 million is C&I, $109 million is CRE. $90 million C&I. Rich, do you have an answer to that? We do. Laurie, we can answer the question now, but it will be included in the 8-K. Yes. The healthcare and social assistance is about $600 million, $650 million and education, about $80 million. And the LTV on CRE deferments is approximately 53%. $1.1 billion was, I think, also 53%.

Earnings before income taxes and provision for credit losses were $85.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, an increase of $3 million or 4% compared to the prior quarter and an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. While net loan balances decreased quarter-over-quarter, commercial and industrial loans increased $104.2 million or 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. Net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 2.71% quarter-over-quarter with majority of the increase occurring on a core basis. We continue to benefit from Fed rate cuts and saw our cost of interest bearing deposits declined 20 basis points to 1.39% from the fourth quarter. Total non-interest income totaled $14.7 million for the quarter, a decline of $5.8 million quarter-over-quarter. We recorded elevated swap and equipment finance fees in the fourth quarter and saw both return to more normalized levels in the first quarter. Expenses totaled $102.6 million for the three months ended March 31, a decrease of $4.3 million or 4% compared to the three months ended December 31, 2019. The efficiency ratio improved to 54.6% from 56.5% in Q4, reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in non-interest expense. We adopted CECL on January 1, 2020. Upon adoption, the company recorded an increase in allowance for credit losses of $11.7 million. Provision for credit losses was $31.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, and was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time we closed the books in early April, our forecast scenarios included a second quarter GDP decline of up to nearly 25% and unemployment up to 13% and a U-shape recovery. Given the uncertainty on how the pandemic will unfold generally makes projecting provision difficult. That being said, our provision in the second quarter will be driven in large part by the expected duration and severity of the pandemic. Asset quality, liquidity and capital were in a strong position at quarter end as we headed into this pandemic. Non-accrual loans represented 0.46% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.44% at December 31, while our allowance for credit losses to loans stood at 1.22% at March 31. Our Common Equity Tier one ratio was 13.1% at quarter end, exceeding the well-capitalized level by approximately $1.3 billion. In addition, all of our regulatory ratios were meaningfully above well-capitalized levels at quarter end. Liquidity is robust and improved quarter-over-quarter. Our loan-to-deposit ratio stood at 117% at quarter end, down from 122% at year end and our access to borrowing facilities and other liquidity sources totaled over $9 billion at March 31. The unprecedented environment makes it difficult to provide formal guidance at this time. As such, we are withdrawing our previous provided earnings guidance. That said, at a high level, we expect our margin to continue to benefit from declining deposit costs in the near term and the loan growth will remain muted given the economic backdrop and our focus on profitability, but could change based on business conditions. Expenses generally are expected to be in line with previous guidance. Finally, we will be providing some additional details on deferrals and loan balances by industry type, referenced by Kevin today, in our 8-K that gets filed with our press release. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks. Yes, Mark. I know what you're hinting at, but it really is hard to predict. I mean things change daily. And I certainly understand where you're going there. And it certainly feels like things are getting better. But I think we'd be a little reluctant to really venture out saying that in absolute terms., so for now, the environment changes. I think it's safe to say if things improve and the economic environment improves, I think your statement will hold true. If things deteriorate in some way, then we could be looking at elevated provisions. So we'll go the way the economy goes. I wouldn't go so far as to say double-digit, but certainly, we are expecting to see some NIM expansion next quarter driven by lower deposit costs, lower borrowing costs. Yes. There's a lot of moving pieces there. But if we held everything else constant, that's going on, which is kind of a bold statement. But if everything else was constant and we saw borrowings costs are coming down and deposit costs continuing to come down in the lower environment. Yes, that should translate into improved NIM throughout the year. But things are moving around all over the place and it's really hard to predict. So that's why we're backing off a bit going too far out trying to make projections. Yes. Laurie, it's Sean. We're down -- I'm going to look it up, but I think it was down $2.9 million, Laurie, quarter-over-quarter. So the fourth quarter had some elevated swap-throughs this quarter a little bit lighter than what we normally expect.

            "name": "Kevin Cummings",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp first quarter earnings conference call. Last night, the company reported in its press release net income of $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 versus $48.7 million or $0.19 per share for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $48.2 million or $0.18 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31 last year. But I must say that the historical results have less meaning in today's environment as we deal with the economic uncertainty and much more serious issues of health and safety as we manage through this unprecedented pandemic. Right now, our priority is protecting everyone's health and well-being: our employees, customers, vendors and the communities where we work. Our pandemic crisis management team meets daily and includes the entire executive management team, plus key members of credit, operational, compliance and cyber risk management, where we discuss issues and topics ranging from employee health issues and technology to capital and liquidity management. We are focused on operating with a strong liquidity position as we are maintaining an above-average cash balance at quarter end. We continue to maintain a robust capitalization by limiting balance sheet growth and foregoing share buy backs. Excess capital and liquidity plus a fortress balance sheet will serve us well through these uncertain times. Credit topics include asset quality, portfolio analysis and adherence to and revisions to credit policies to meet the current environment. It should be noted that our loan portfolio's past performance has been very strong, and we are well-positioned entering this cycle. Our net charge offs over the past three years have averaged just 4 basis points and 5 basis points over the last 5 years. Our loan portfolio has a lower risk profile compared to our peers as almost 60% of our loans are in the residential space in the multifamily and residential mortgages portfolio. Total net charge offs for the multifamily and mortgage loan portfolios for the 5 years ended 12/31/19, were less than $1 million in total and $22 million for the residential portfolio, respectively. In the first quarter of this year, net charge off totaled $615,000 for these two portfolios. Our average LTVs at year end were approximately 60% for the residential and multifamily portfolios and 55% for the CRE and consumer portfolios. Our weighted average debt service coverage ratio for the multi portfolio, excluding co-op loans, was 1.38x and 1.61x for the CRE portfolio. Our FICO scores for the residential and consumer loan portfolios was 749 and 731, respectively at year-end. Credit quality has been our focus and will continue to be our strength as we move through the crisis. We hope for the best but are prepared for the storm and have placed little reliance on any of the economic predictions that we hear in the news or from the co-experts. No one knows where this crisis will go and we will continue to be diligent in our management by being prudent in our judgments and adhering to our core values and serving our customers and communities as a good corporate citizen. All banking services remain available to our customers in the retail network as branches remain open with drive-thru and ATMs and by appointment in the branches. Our digital channels allow customers to transact remotely and our call center has been staffed up to ensure that we are able to assist our customers in a timely manner. Last week, our average wait time at the call center was two minutes and was as low as 25 seconds. And our call drop rate was as low as 2% over the past week with a daily average under 10%. We have waived the number of consumer fees for up to 90 days and that includes but are not limited to ATM monthly maintenance and overdraft fees. Additionally, we are allowing our customers to defer mortgage payments for up to 90 days due to the financial hardships caused by this crisis. We have deferred monthly mortgage payments for approximately 1,600 customers with a total balance of $648 million with an average balance of $400,000. On the commercial side, we've been proactive in reaching out to our customers to help them through this crisis. Our C&I portfolio has deferments on 299 loans for a total balance of $580 million or 19%. Total impact on cash flow was approximately $18 million over the 90-day period. For the multifamily portfolio, deferments totaled $1.2 billion on 227 loans for an average loan of $5.3 million and the CRE portfolio had deferments totaling $1.3 billion on 305 loans with an average balance of $4.3 million. The total payment deferments amounts were $12 million and $20 million for the multi and CRE portfolios over the 90-day deferment period. At year end, for the multifamily and CRE customers with deferments, the average debt service coverage was 1.69x and 1.47x respectively. For the CRE and multifamily, the average LTV on deferred loans was approximately 53% for both portfolios. We have been active working with the public, not-for-profit space and the private sectors to meet the needs of our customers and our community. Overall, banks through this crisis have played a significant role to act as a conduit between the government and our customers. In an unprecedented role, banks have stepped into provide the process and the manpower to disperse billions of relief to small businesses throughout New Jersey and throughout the country. Government could not get this done alone, but it is a public-private partnership to help businesses in need. And I certainly hope that this program, although not perfect, does not come back to haunt the industry when the time passes and people on the sidelines in Washington question the decisions made in the heat of this battle. Investors Bank, without an SBA platform was able to build a digital platform working with the fintech partners and it was and it certainly was not an easy process. It was a difficult time and probably not our finest hour, but the team worked diligently and was able to execute with the SBA, satisfying our entire pipeline with current SBA approvals of approximately $335 million for 1,850 customers. We were very prudent in our expectations here as we did not want to over promise or under deliver with our customers. Investors Bank and the industry as a whole has worked around the clock to assist the Treasury and the SBA in providing relief to small businesses throughout the country. It was our civic duty to get this done, and I'm very proud of our perseverance and grit and the personal sacrifices of our teams made to support our customers. It has not been easy, but like the fear experienced during the initial outbreak of this pandemic in the New York metropolitan area, we have overcome many obstacles in the workplace, including technology challenges, working from home and caring for the families of the employees and friends who were lost to this coronavirus. We are at the epicenter of this crisis and we have the team to manage through these many problems. From the very beginning, we stepped up our cleaning protocols in the branches and corporate locations as per the CDC guidelines. Since early March, all employees have been dispersed and are either working from home or in other ISBC locations, including key operating functions such as wires, treasury, call center and executive management with the majority of our back office employees working from home. Those employees who remain on-site are practicing social distancing with limited in-person meetings and travel. Health benefits have been expanded for our employees through the employee assistance program, the waiving of co-pays and all telemedicine visits. Through all this calamity, we were able to close our acquisition of Gold Coast Bank on April 3, adding seven branches to our Long Island franchise with $488 million in deposits and $453 million in loans. Our legal team did an outstanding job working with the bankers and Gold Coast CEO, John Tsunis and his management team to close this deal when others may have postponed or walked away from the transaction. I'd like to thank our GC, Brian Doran, Chief Technology Officer, Chris Blotto and Facilities Director, Joe Valente, by getting this deal closed, completing the systems conversion in the weekend and changing the interior and exterior signages to the Investors Bank brand all on a weekend through difficult circumstances to say the least. We wish to welcome the Gold Coast customers and employees to the Investors family. And as part of this transaction and in consultation with its Chairman, John Tsunis, we made $100,000 donation to the Stony Brook University Hospital to assist their workers as the hospital built 1,000-bed temporary mesh-like hospital on the football field of the university. We've been very busy supporting the healthcare workers and the not-for-profits in our community. Early on in March, we allocated to the retail branches and their staff $150,000 budget to invest in the community with meals for elderly customers who may be homebound, donation to food pantries, purchase of air purification machines for the New York Hospital, gift cards for medical workers and many other acts of kindness and hope in a time of uncertainty and despair. Our foundation has made disbursements of $820,000 to food banks, health providers, youth services, homeless shelters, housing and supporting the underserved in our communities. We have made grants for economic support of small businesses of $125,000. The bank and foundation have also added additional funding to local charities, foundations and the community of $190,000 to support local not-for-profits and retail and small businesses in need during this crisis. In this time of uncertainty, it is time for the private sector to support our communities and show the country the generosity of the banking industry as the heart of capitalism in our society. Coming into this pandemic, we think we have a strong balance sheet, excess liquidity and stellar credit quality and are well positioned to weather this storm. We have strong liquidity at our parent company. And at the Board meeting this week, a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share was approved, payable in May. Based on today's forecast, we believe we are well-positioned to maintain this dividend going forward. We had great momentum coming off a strong fourth quarter and executing the Blue Harbour transaction at year end. January and February were probably the best two months for their earnings in the history of the company as we earned before the March Fed cuts $38.6 million for the two months ended February 29. We are in another world, though today as we navigate this pandemic and look forward to getting back to some sense of normalcy. With respect to credit quality, our loan loss reserve increased to $243 million, which is 1.14% of total loans at March 31. Our provision was $31.2 million for the quarter, which includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. I estimate that approximately $24 million to $26 million of this provision is related to this economic and health crisis. Our non-accrual loans totaled $98 million, down from last year at March 31 by 17%, but up slightly from year end by $3 million. The increase from year end is due to one business loan for $5 million, which matured in December 2019 and has not been renewed. At this time, we believe we are well collateralized and no loss is expected. Our allowance for loan losses coverage ratio to non-accrual loans is 248%, up from 200% at this time last year. During the quarter, we had one significant charge-off of $8 million on a loan in our leveraged lending portfolio, which was not meeting its cash flow projections and was in a sales process with an investment banker that failed due to the pandemic crisis. This portfolio totals $264 million with 23 borrowers at March 31, with one borrower over $20 million. Three loans are currently in the deferral process, with two making their first quarter interest payment and one making a partial interest payment. Our 30-day delinquencies were up in the multifamily portfolio by $12.3 million, and the three largest loans for approximately $45 million have made their March payments. In the CRE portfolio, the increase relates to one loan for $20 million to a significant investor that has over $20 million invested in a Manhattan property. We are monitoring all these loans closely considering the economic environment. Total deposits increased $324 million for the quarter as the cost of deposits decreased 20 basis points as we reacted quickly to the pandemic by increasing our liquidity, by increasing cash and due from banks by $500 million at quarter end. Capital liquidity and reserves are key factors as we navigate through this crisis. As rates have come down, we felt it prudent to invest in building our liquidity reserves at the expense of some earnings to be better prepared for the uncertain future. As I said earlier, we are preparing for the worst but hoping for the best. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sean, our CFO, who will give some additional color on our operating results for the quarter. Sean? Okay, Sean. Thank you. Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in the community and continue to live by our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of uncertainty. We are here for our customers. We are partnering with both the not-for-profit sector and the government sectors to help our communities. We have had our challenges, but as of today, we have executed on the task and the projects that this pandemic has created. Working from home, communications with both employees and customers, technology changes and enhancements, cybersecurity, the Gold Coast acquisition, commercial and mortgage loan deferrals, building a platform for the SBA program and leading our teams during a period of uncertainty and fear all have come with unique problems and adjustments. The bank has accomplished these things because of the hard work and leadership of our executives. At times, it may seem overwhelming, but we are getting it done. We will work continue to work together and encourage, now inspire our teams to reach into the depth of their souls to get through this crisis and clear those obstacles in front of us. We do not plan to survive, but we will strive through this crisis and rise to be the best that we can be. The bank will be a source of inspiration during these times because it is through inspiration and encouragement that brings great execution, success and peace in your life. Our communities and customers need us now more than ever. We will continue to step up and face these challenges. Our leaders continue to inspire each other to our greatest moments, knowing that we are giving our best and leaving all our energy on the field. It is a war out there and we will not be victims of this virus, but we will be victors. Now I'd like to turn the call over to some questions. Thank you very much. Yes. I think our number 1 concern is to protect the dividend moving forward. And buy backs are going to take a backseat. We've always managed capital on a 4-pronged approach; M&A, organic growth, buybacks and dividends. And it's always been our prudent approach of balancing those things, using them when available. I know the stock price is down, but it's certainly not a time in the foreseeable future to jump into that part of the strategy to manage our capital. And $1.8 billion, $1.795 billion CRE. Well, we gave the in my remarks, we gave the overall CRE on the deferments. And I believe it was about 55%. I'll check it, okay? Okay. One second. Yes. Okay. Thanks, Chris. I'd like to thank you for your participation today. When I think about the past two months, I am grateful for the leadership team that I work with and all the employees at the bank. Through great hardship and personal sacrifice, they've done a great job. They continue to amaze me, and I'm humble to leave them with Dom and the executive team. As Churchill once said, \"Fear is a reaction, and courage is a decision.\" Our message is to be faithful and not fearful. We need to be a source of hope and optimism in our communities and continue to live our core values by being a good corporate citizen and making a difference in a time of great stress and uncertainty. Please stay healthy out there. Be careful, and follow the CDC guidelines. Let's pray for each other and inspire each other that we can all be safe and the very best versions of ourselves during this crisis as we make the journey together. I want to thank you again for participating today, and please be careful, and I look forward to the day that we can be out on the road visiting with all of you soon. Have a great day, stay healthy and be strong. Talk to you soon. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here and will discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call. We are pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full year. And we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum through 2022. The investments that we've made to transform and reposition Citizens since our IPO are really bearing fruit. Our customer centric approach, backed by a full range of product offerings and strong digital data and technology capabilities has allowed us to gain market share, deepen relationships with customers, and develop sustainable growth opportunities. We've navigated the pandemic environment well, shifting to offense over the course of 2021 to accelerate our strategy, including five acquisitions as we strive to build a unique and special top performing bank.  I'll comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying earnings per share was $1.26 and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%. Sequential operating leverage was 1.5%, that's 1.8% ex acquisitions and sequential growth in PPNR was a strong 6%. Leading our performance was an unbelievably strong quarter in our capital markets business, led by M&A and loan syndications. We built a great business through hiring top talent in combination with several acquisitions, and our approach to market is really clicking. For the quarter, we were number one in the league table for middle market sponsor transactions and number four for overall middle market. We only had JMP results for six weeks of the quarter, but we're very excited about how they'll augment what we've already assembled. Our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of 4% on a spot basis, 5% ex PPP, while average growth was 2% and that's 3% ex PPP. Commercial growth and a pickup in line utilization were bright spots, and we enter 2022 with a good jump off point. We did a nice job on expenses pulling across our top efficiency saves to help offset higher incentive comp tied to revenues. And credit remains pristine as good as it gets. Our capital position remains strong with CET1 ratio of 9.9% giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2022. We have the capital and liquidity to fund the attractive loan growth we expect to see in 2022\u0323, while looking for selective acquisitions and ensuring strong returns of capital to shareholders. With respect to our guidance for 2022, we assume solid economic growth of around 4%, several fed rate hikes and improvement in loan demands. Our top six and top seven programs should allow us to keep expense growth ex acquisitions below 3% and we're targeting 2% positive operating leverage, including the bank yield scheduled to close soon, and almost 5% ex PPP impact. Credit is expected to continue to be highly favorable, and I'd expect our return on tangible common equity to move over 14% in the second half of the year, potentially reaching 15% in Q4. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2021, and we feel we are well-positioned to do well in 2022 and continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2021. We know we can count on you again in the new year. So, with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $569 million and EPS of $1.26. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.6%, which included the impact of a credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 4% linked quarter, given strong growth in fee income. Average loans were up a solid 3% in the quarter, before the impact of PPP forgiveness, led by retail which is up by 4% and 3% growth in commercial. Overall spot loan growth of 5% for the quarter excluding PPP, provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year. Linked quarter fee growth was 16% or 10% before acquisitions, including outstanding results in capital markets, driven by record M&A fees and loan syndications as we've executed well and gained market share. And excluding the impact of the two commercial fee-based acquisitions we close in the second half, we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately 2% this quarter with well controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $25 million, which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy. Our year end ACL ratio stands at 1.51%, above our day one CECL level of 1.47%. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.9% after returning $360 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the fourth quarter, while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was down 2%, given lower net interest margin, partially offset by strong loan growth. The net interest margin was 2.66%, down 6 basis points reflecting a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness, and lower earning asset yields given changes in loan mix and spread compression, partially offset by the impact of lower cash balances as we redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. We also made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 1 basis point to 13 basis points. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see we remain highly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter with an overall sensitivity of 10.1% to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates. At the end of the year, about 60% of our sensitivity is geared towards the short end. So, we are well-positioned to benefit when the Fed begin to tighten. Referring to Slide 7, we delivered terrific fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses with outstanding results in capital markets. reflecting our long-term investments in the business and solid performance across other fee categories. We set a new record for quarterly capital markets with exceptional strength in M&A advisory and loan syndication fees, amid a backdrop of good market activity. We continue to gain market share and have nice momentum as we enter 2022. We also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in FX and IRP, which are up 21% linked quarter, given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust M&A activity and an increase in client hedging given the outlook for rate rises. Mortgage fees declined in the quarter against the backdrop of strong competition in excess industry capacity. We saw ongoing pressure on gain on sale margins, particularly in third-party channels and seasonally lower production volume. Mortgage servicing income improved as our third-party servicing book grew 3% linked quarter to $90 billion. Card fees were stable as debit transactions and credit card spend continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels, while fees also remain strong. Service charges and fees were modestly lower reflecting the impact of Citizens peace of mind, our new customer friendly deposit account feature. We are seeing these changes drive clear benefits from customer experience as customer satisfaction is up and call center volume is down since we implemented the changes. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled. Excluding the impact of the fee-based acquisitions that closed in the second half of the year, non-interest expense was stable, and we drove linked quarter operating leverage of about 2%. These results reflect higher incentive compensation types of strong capital markets revenue and strategic investments, which was balanced by strong expense discipline and the benefit of top efficiency initiatives. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 4% linked quarter or 5% excluding PPP. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth of more than 6% excluding PPP. Retail loans are also growing up 4%. Average loans were up 2% and up more than 3% excluding PPP. Retail strength was driven by mortgage and auto. Commercial originations were very strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels led by corporate banking, subscription line financing, supporting deal related activity and asset backed lending. After line utilizations levels ticked up last quarter, we saw a larger increase of about 270 basis points to 35% on the spot basis this quarter, primarily driven by deal related financing activity. We continue to expect a gradual recovery and utilization over the coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve. In addition, our period-end commitments are up a very strong 8% which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year with strong growth in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits, up from 30% last year. Interest bearing deposits were broadly stable as the continued runoff of higher cost of term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lower cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit repricing with interest bearing deposit costs down 1 basis point to 13 basis points during the quarter. Given the changing tone of the Fed and the potential that they may begin to tighten earlier -- early this year, we thought it would be helpful to make a few points about how we see our deposit costs behaving in the next rate cycle. First, we've made significant improvements to our deposit related capabilities since the IPO. Our enhanced data analytics capabilities allow us to optimize the deposit base by attracting more stable deposits with targeted offers and by employing more dynamic pricing. We also have the added lever of Citizens Access, which was proven to be a very efficient deposit channel. And we have strengthened our commercial offerings and invested in enhanced tools to drive higher operating deposits. Secondly, our mix of lower cost deposits is much better with demand deposits now 32% of the book, compared to 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And consumer CDs, which were at 14% of total deposits at the end of the last cycle are now down to 3%, which is below peer levels. Also note that the HSBC branch acquisition will add almost $8 billion or 5% to our core deposits when we close this quarter. Lastly, we have vastly improved our overall liquidity profile with a lower LDR and much lower deposit costs than when we entered the last rate cycle. When you add that all up, we are confident that our deposit base will be meaningful low -- meaningfully lower than the prior cycle. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter. Net charge-offs were broadly stable at 14 basis points for the fourth quarter with good performance across the portfolio. Nonperforming loans decreased 6% linked quarter with continued improvement in commercial. Other credit metrics continue to improve as criticized loans were lower and internal ratings upgrades exceeded downgrades. Moving to Slide 12. We maintained an excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remain strong at 9.9% at the end of the fourth quarter, after returning $360 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and closing the JMP acquisition. On the bottom right of the page, we expect a 22 basis point impact to CET1 from the pending HSBC acquisitions, and the ISPC transaction will be effectively neutral given the stock to be issued in the deal. Shifting gears towards business strategy a bit, we thought it would be useful to have Brendan and Don discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway and how we are poised for strong and sustainable growth. Brendan, over to you.\nBrendan Coughlin: Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 13, you can see we've dramatically transformed the Consumer Bank since the IPO and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future. Let me share a few highlights. We're acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the U.S., nearly doubling our customer base from approximately 3 million at the time of our IPO to 6.4 million today. Further, our mobile engagement is up 15% year-over-year closing gaps to peers and allow us to thin our physical network by another 8% this year, about 20% since our IPO. This enables us to reinvest in growth strategies. We built one of the most diversified consumer lending businesses in the U.S., giving us a number of additional levers for revenue growth and customer deepening that many of our peer banks lack. We've transformed our deposit book, repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong DDA growth, which has really driven down our cost of funds by about 75% compared with the time of our IPO. Finally, while we have more work to do, our wealth business has been repositioned for growth, and our AUM is more than 3x the size at the time of the IPO. So, 5 years ago, we were very much a traditional regional only bank. We have strong momentum in the business, have broadly caught up with peers and in a number of places have built best in market capabilities that have lived to differentiated growth rates. Moving on to Slide 14 and looking forward, we prioritized several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver above trend revenue growth, adding about $1 billion by the year five. First, we expect to leverage our acquisitions in New York Metro markets to grow share and deepen relationships. We will pick up almost 1 million new customers who have been underserved given that their current banks don't have the breadth of product capabilities that we have. There is strong upside if we can replicate in New York, what we had done in our core markets like Philadelphia and Boston. The second area is wealth, where we have a great opportunity as well. We've recently attracted a new and strong leadership team with a long track record of industry success, our regional footprint, and our bank customer base is highly attractive and provide significant opportunity for sustained growth. Third, our Citizens Pay offering is unique amongst all the industry players in the fast growing buy now pay later space. We were early movers in the space starting with the Apple partnership in 2015. We built a very strong position now with 44 partners. We've added industry verticals and have remained focused on getting marquee partners providing good momentum, and with a strong pipeline for 2022. Lastly, our national push will be led by our digital capabilities and that includes our efforts to build on the Citizens Access launch in 2018, and the integration of our full range of products and services on a modern cloud-based platform. We'll continue to add products to the platform in '22 and we'll aim to drive improved customer deepening. We will also leverage the strategy to accelerate our technology transformation of our core bank, as we ultimately aim to converge the operating platforms into one national digital first structure. Now let me pass it over to Don.\nDon McCree: Okay. Good stuff, Brendan. Let me shift to our commercial priorities which were on Slide 15. We've added some great talent to the commercial bank on both the coverage side as well as the product side, and we're able to do more for our customers over their life cycle than ever before. We've been near the top of the middle market league tables helping corporate clients and private equity sponsors access capital to private and public debt and equity markets. And we've integrated our cash management and global market solutions well with our coverage teams. On the coverage side, we're expanding geographically and moving upmarket into the mid corporate space where it's critical to deliver deep industry expertise. Our JMP acquisition, which closed late last year, gives us a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, health care and financial services. Plus, we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded and we're already seeing great cross-sell dividends off of it. As non-bank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continue to increase, we\u2019ve broadened our capabilities to better compete successfully in the new landscape. We will increase -- we increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities. It's also worth noting that Willamette, the transaction we closed mid last year dramatically expands our valuation services business with a very prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort and has annuity like qualities. So, you can see the success we've had in building and scaling up our businesses to deliver more than just traditional banking products to our clients. We are highly confident that this list will continue to drive sustainable and growing revenue streams. Over to you, John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Don. On Slide 16, you'll see some examples of the tremendous progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives that Brendan and Don mentioned, and other what we're doing across the Bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. We are very excited to see how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Moving to Slide 17, I'll touch on our TOP programs. Even as we intended to offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous efforts to realize efficiencies and reinvest these savings back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively wrapped up our TOP six programs after achieving our targeted pre-tax run rate benefits of approximately $425million at the end of 2021. Now we have launched TOP 7 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022. We are really doubling back to mine areas where we have already been successful. For example, continuing our multiyear journey of digital transformation across consumer and commercial, looking at further organizational streamlining, accelerating and building on our next gen tech initiatives and doing more in the cloud. We're going to focus on maturing our agile operating model and take another look at our vendor spend as well. Based on the work we've done so far, we feel confident that we can deliver on this new program. Moving to Slide 18, we made a lot of progress on the ESG front last year, and we will continue to make meaningful progress in 2022. A few highlights for the launch of a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact. We adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We have a strong commitment to social equity, and our colleagues continue a tradition of being highly focused on volunteering in our communities. To serve our clients better, we introduced new deposit account features that help customers avoid unexpected overdraft fees, and we immediately saw changes that indicate a meaningful improvement in customer experience. This should help attract and keep more customers with the bank. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook for full year 2022 on Slide 19. First, let me be clear that this is a standalone outlook that includes JMP and Willamette, which closed late last year, but does not include any benefit from our pending acquisitions of HSBC and Investors. The bottom left corner of the page includes information that should help if you're trying to also layer in the expected contribution from these acquisitions in 2022. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by mid-single-digit average loan growth. Excluding PPP, we expect NII to grow high single digits driven by high single-digit average loan growth. Average interest earning assets are expected to be up slightly as excess liquidity is deployed into loan growth. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of January 5, and includes three implied Fed rate hikes of 25 basis points each in April, July and December. On the long end, we are planning for the 10-year treasury to be about 1.9% by the end of the year. The rate curve benefit on net interest margin will allow us to be to more than offset the 2022 impacts from lower PPP forgiveness and swap revenue, while presenting meaningful upside to NIM in 2023 and beyond. Fee income is expected to be up 4% to 7% given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performances in 2021. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 5% to 6% given the full year effect of our commercial fee-based acquisitions, or up less than 3% excluding the impact of these acquisitions. We have included an expense walk on Slide 24, that lays out the drivers. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly and provision expense is less than net charge-offs. And we plan to continue operating with a CET1 ratio within our target range of 9.75% to 10%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. On the lower left of the slide, you'll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of HSBC and Investors with EPS accretion of about 5% based on consensus at the time of announcing and approximately $475 million in additional PPNR to our 2022 results. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis point -- basis for the year, including HSBC and Investors. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be a very strong 5% operating leverage. Moving to Slide 20, I'll cover the outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be down about 1% despite solid loan growth, given a $20 million smaller contribution from PPP, and an $18 million impact from lower data, including the impact of HSBC, NII will be broadly stable for the quarter. Average loans are expected to be up 2% to 3% with interest bearing assets broadly stable. Fees are expected to be down 8% to 12%, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets fees than the record we delivered last quarter, as well as see other seasonal impacts. Non-interest expense is expected to be up approximately 6% given seasonal compensation impacts and the full quarter impact of the JMP acquisition. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable with provision less than net-charge offs. And we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%, including an impact of about 22 basis points from the HSBC transaction, which we expect to close in the quarter. To sum up with Slide 21, we feel that we finished 2021 with a great quarter and entered 2022 with strong momentum. We have a winning strategy. We are building capabilities organic -- organically and through acquisitions that deliver value to our customers and growth for our shareholders. Our strong leadership team will continue to focus on execution and building a top-performing bank. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun.  Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open now.\nPeter Winter: Good morning. I had a question. One thing I hear, I get from investors is the potential for deal risk noise just between the HSBC and Investors Bancorp, and then also the investors loan mix being heavy in commercial real estate. So, the question is, is there a need to remix the loan portfolio at investors and lead to some near-term revenue headwinds and just potential volatility closing both deals in the first half of the year?\nBruce Van Saun: Let me start and John, you can jump in. So, it's Bruce. Peter, I think we're working really well and hard to make sure that these deals come off very smoothly. Customers have a good experience and we can introduce our approach to banking right off the bat and take advantage of, I think, some really great synergy opportunities. So, we've set up a separate integration office. We've had outside help -- helping us through and put dedicated teams to make sure that we get off to a good start. So, I don't really see any disruption from smoothness of operations. I think that'll come off very, very well. We're monitoring the performance of both businesses, and they seem to be performing to our expectations. So that's also a good fact. We will end up taking on more commercial real estate exposure when Investors closes. However, most of that is in multifamily, and the kind of risk of that portfolio is relatively modest in terms on the spectrum of commercial real estate risks. So, I think we'll look to grow our other loan categories faster over time, which will bring kind of that exposure back into more alignment of where a targeted balance sheet would be. But we don't think there'll be any need to do any dramatic surgery or anything that would disrupt the momentum that we have in loan growth. So, I'll stop there and, John, if you want to add anything to that?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I think that's well said. I would just add that as it relates to the operational side of things, we've got a number of mock conversions and dress rehearsals that have gone extremely well. The last one is, I think, next weekend. So, we're right on schedule for HSBC, for that closing conversion in middle of February. So that's really sort of well-handled and we're deep into the planning on Investors as well, planning for legal day one planning for customer day one planning for conversion and those plans are also well insight and appear well able to be executed. On the balance sheet aspects that Bruce mentioned, and just reemphasizing our front book originations will look different than the backlog. The backlog has the multifamily loan portfolios as Bruce indicated, but that front book is going to have a lot more C&I and a lot more consumer lending going forward than Investors has had in the past. So, with that, I'll go ahead and leave it there.\nPeter Winter: Thanks. Very helpful. And then if I could just ask, John, I'm wondering, could you quantify the impact to net interest income for every 25 basis point rate hike and what you're assuming for the deposit betas?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'm going to talk about that. I mean, I think we are highly asset sensitive. And that's built into the guide for NII for 2022. Based on the Gen 5 curve. And as you know, since then, the curve has increased a fair bit as of -- as just looking at it were things ended up yesterday. So, there's more upside in 2022, if the rate environment continues to unfold as we're seeing it in the last several days. But as it relates to the actual sensitivity, the way that shakes out is that on the show, we're mostly sensitive to the short end and that'll drive about $20 million if there's a -- if there's an extra 25 basis points. On top of the forward curves as of January 5, we'll generate another $20 million per quarter on that -- on the short end, and we'll get another 10 to 15 per quarter on the long end versus the January 5 forward curve for an overall $30 million to $35 million per quarter of additional benefit, if you have 25 basis points \u2026\nBruce Van Saun: It\u2019s a parallel shift.\nJohn Woods: \u2026 that require -- yes, on a parallel shift up from the Gen 5 curve. As it relates to deposit betas. I mean, this is a very exciting story. I mean, we've completely transformed the deposit franchise since the IPO. And I would say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think that our deposit betas are going to be meaningfully lower in this next cycle. And, of course, we just start off the cycle, it's all -- there's a lag. And we've got that lag built in, but we also have some betas built in. But I would say that the 2022 betas at the beginning of this cycle are going to be much lower than the betas that we experienced at the beginning of the rate rise cycle last time around, given all the investments we made and product capability in pricing, and an approach and with the added level of Citizens Access. So, we're really excited about being able to demonstrate the strength of the deposit franchise in this cycle going forward.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Just to quantify that a little bit, if you look at the last move up 2% on Fed funds and then you compare to if that happened today, we'd probably be a third less in terms of our deposit betas than we were last time around.\nJohn Woods: Exactly.\nPeter Winter: Okay. Thanks very much.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thank you for the detail on the merger updates and the timelines. I'm just wondering, can you just give us a sense of what point do you expect to get both converted? And do you have an understanding of when you think you'll get to kind of full run rate cost saves from the combination of HSBC and ISBC?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and start. As it relates to -- we're targeting towards the end of '23 when we'll have substantially all the synergies done. And as I mentioned, we're going to close our convert HSBC here in February. The expectation is our target is to close Investors in early first quarter, early April. And I would say the way to think about conversion is that that's not going to be a big bang approach. We're going to see that conversions happen throughout on a staged and phased basis throughout 2022, assuming we close in early April, you will see a couple of platforms closed throughout 2022 and into the end of 2022. And there could be some stragglers into the early part of 2023. But again, it's not going to be a big bang. We're going to move certain platforms over as they become ready to go. And I think for - as an example, mortgage and wealth are two platforms that will go early and the overall core what happened later. So maybe I'll just -- maybe turn it over to others if they want to add any color to that.\nBruce Van Saun: I think that's right, John.\nKen Usdin: Okay, great. And my second question is just, I know you've said very clearly that you wouldn't expect to update capital targets in such until you reach your medium-term goals. I'm just wondering, so should we think -- how should we be thinking about share repurchase in terms of getting through closings and any anticipations you have about anticipating this year's CCAR process with you getting back into -- in '22?\nJohn Woods: I will just start off. And as you may know, I mean, we've talked about the C4, our capital priorities start off with a dividend and supporting organic growth and fee-based bolt-ons. And so, we want to put capital to work in that manner. And to the extent that that those opportunities, we leave some capital around, then we engage in buybacks, which we did this quarter, or this past quarter, 4Q, as we articulated in our remarks. So, I mean, I think we're coming into CCAR season, and we tend to, on an annual basis, take another look at capital targets, and what the trajectory of capital return will be. We also have the deals that are pending. So, I think you'll get -- we can be a little bit more sort of give another update on that as you get into the first quarter call.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And, Ken, just from a technical standpoint, we had an authorization to buy back 750 million of our stock. And we've used about 300 of that to date that we have 450 left for this year, which should give us plenty of running room. When we get through CCAR, you might see us do an adjustment to that. But anyway, that's a little bit of the framework that we're operating under.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.\nBruce Van Saun: Yep.\nOperator: Your next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning, Pan.\nJohn Pancari: Just on the loan trends, clearly, the commercial trends came in very solid and better than expected. Just want to see if you can give us a little bit more granularity on where you're really seeing that strength and the drivers. I know you mentioned deal financing or you're seeing CapEx plans start to drive some drawdowns there? And then separately, just in terms of the end of period loan balances, looks like there are a few billion above the average balances. And so therefore the end of period balance is a good leading indicator into outlook as we modeled this out.\nJohn Woods: Maybe I will just start off and Don can weigh in here. I mean, I think as we mentioned, corporate banking and subscription line finance and asset backed lending all contributed, and it has been an excellent quarter and there is momentum with spot balances higher than average. So that's right, John. I would say when you split it out, we are seeing -- last quarter we saw it tick up in utilization from our sort of bread-and-butter corporate banking clients. This quarter, we saw another tick up. In that sense, a lot of the increase was driven by deal financing, but we are seeing some underlying tick up maybe 50 basis points last quarter, another 50 or so this quarter. Maybe I'll just turn it over to Don to add any additional color.\nDon McCree: I think that's right. I think the big macro is our origination volumes are just huge, record quarter on quarter on quarter. And they've been offset by payoffs as people go into the capital markets or and in particular real estate, a lot of properties are trading. So, we're being taken out of loans due to underlying property sales. But we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the origination side. The subscription line business that we have is really going quite well. It's growing quite quickly. Some of the deal financing that happened in the fourth quarter will be refinanced out in the capital markets probably which is good for us because we will participate in that. But we think the trend continues. The other thing that we are seeing is a lot of activity in our real estate business on the origination side. We're seeing quite a bit of warehousing, quite a bit of industrial, quite a bit of life sciences and then increasingly build a suit office, believe it or not. So, investment grade corporates building new office space to occupy post pandemic. In terms of working capital and CapEx and things like that, it's really hard to kind of discern how quickly that's going to happen. You've got the new supply chain challenges, you've got some of the labor challenges, you get some of the international countries shutting down. So, it's kind of fits and starts, but we think it's -- it feels pretty good to us overall.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, Bruce, just a question from higher level. I know you certainly been acquisitive here in adding to your business, both on the banking side as well as cap market. Could you just talk about from a banking perspective the need for scale, the whole debate that do you need scale to be able to compete effectively? and more specifically, do you think ultimately you need a national franchise? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Sure. So, I like our size, John. So, I think we have enough scale that we can compete against all comers. We have to be extremely disciplined. We have to prioritize well, we have to leverage the external parties, our principal core application vendors, we have a lot of partnerships with Fintechs. But we do a really good job there and we're moving the company to be a digital first bank and I like the progress there. So, one of the advantages you have if you're not super big, not in the mega bank weight classes, that you can be more nimble, and you can move faster and you can stay focused on the things that really matter. So, scale does help to some degree. So doing this New York Metro play and picking up another $30 billion of assets, I think is a positive, but we don't feel compelled to have to run out and do more deals to stay competitive. Was there a second part of your question, John?\nJohn Pancari: Well, do you believe you need a national presence, including some brick and motor?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, right. Yes, so there I think we have a pretty unique opportunity because we have a deposit franchise, its national with Citizens Access. We do have consumer lending activities that are national. And we've basically gone to market in a -- in kind of a product siloed fashion without a fully comprehensive platform that allows us to deliver a full range of products and services to customers. So that's been really our focus, and we put it under the umbrella of national expansion. We think there's a really good opportunity to migrate to a cloud-based digital platform that delivers great customer experience, and then leverage that to target specific, very highly specific customer segments where we think we have a right to win. And when we look at what we do really well in our regional core footprint, that's mass affluent customers, particularly young professionals. We have a great offering there. It starts with our student loan refinance product, and we dropped a bunch of things in around that. So, we think we can target that segment around the country, once we pull this all together, and make some real headway. What goes with that is, right now we're largely all digital with that national play. We will pick up some branches in the Washington DC area when HSBC closes and some in South Florida. That'll give us an opportunity to go digital first into those markets combined with a light physical presence, and do some tests and learning because there may be other attractive cities around the country where we have a concentration of customers or calling base, so we have more brand visibility where we might decide to open some branches and then see how that could augment our push to really attract those customers and gain primacy with those customers. So, a lot of play out on this, but it's very exciting. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add anything to that.\nBrendan Coughlin: Well said. I guess I just -- the color as that ties into scale for me is while we don't feel like we are required to get scale, I think the digital first world is providing an opportunity to scale distinctively with revenue. In my opening remarks as part of our call script you see us going from 3 million customers to 6 million customers since our IPO, I would argue that in a pre-digital world that was not possible without M&A activity and we've got a demonstrated track record of scaling our consumer business organically. And so that's what you should think about as we bring together all our product capabilities nationally is how do we get scale and provide distinctive revenue opportunity without necessarily needing to do a big M&A acquisition. We have confidence we can do that. Obviously, we're supplementing that with HSBC and Investors. But really, we think we can get great customer growth and deepening organically. The good question is, do you need physical presence over time and what does that physical presence look like? And can you run it with a thin network to Bruce's point around piloting in Washington DC and Florida and then potentially other markets over time. But all paths lead to the next 18 months or so, we're really building on our exceptional mobile first digital platform nationally, and then we can start to think through our distribution opportunities over time.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead, please.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, John. Good morning, Bruce.\nJohn Woods: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bruce, I share your bullishness on the outlook for the industry and new folks as well. And you presented it very well today. But at the same time, we're always looking over our shoulder. So, when you guys sit around the conference room table to talk about the outlook, what are some of the risks that you have identified that maybe could kind of delay or interrupt this bullish outlook?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. To me, Gerard, it's usually around the macro would be the principal risks. So as the macro goes, it certainly has a big impact on bank results. It looks like the kind of Omicron wave is not as lethal as feared, and it has an interrupted business and commerce and people's behavior as much as it could have as much as prior waves did. So, I put that as a tick in the plus column, although you never know what could happen later on over the course of the year. I do think the Fed has a fine balancing act to achieve here and bringing inflation under control. Inflation is really something to be feared, and the Fed is going to aggressively combat that. And hopefully, they apply the medicine in a good pace with good kind of forewarning in the market adjusts to that. It doesn't kind of snuff out the signs of a good recovery, we think that GDP could grow at 4%. But what could happen if the market doesn't respond well to those rate increases, or if the equity market falls a bit because of that. So that's another thing. I think the fiscal situation seems stable at this point. It's going to be hard, I think, to pass more legislative initiatives that increase fiscal spend. And I think the spend that we have built up from prior rounds of fiscal stimulus is sufficient to carry us through. So anyway, those are some of the things that we've watched. I still feel that the fundamental underpinning is very good and the credit outlook is very good. So, I think there's a strong probability that this turns out to be a good year, but there's always that tail risks that stuff could happen. And that's the thing that we watched carefully.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. Thank you for those insights. And just to follow-up, John, on the guidance, the non-interest income, I think you highlighted that you expect the mortgage fees in 2022 to be weaker than 2021, correct me if I'm wrong there, but more than offset by the strength in capital markets. What's your outlook because the capital markets number, as you guys pointed out was extraordinary in the quarter. I assume you're not expecting that to be a run rate, but can you give us some color on what you're looking for in that capital markets mind in 2022 versus 2021 and also the mortgage banking fees?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll start off and turn it over to Don and Brendan, if they want to add any further color. But I mean, I think if we had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter, taking share and kind of climbing the lead tables, this was a result of multiyear kind of meticulous investments organically with some fee-based bolt-ons that are coming together. And frankly, haven't really fully achieved its potential in some respects in terms of synergies from the deals that we've done, et cetera, that are that are going to contribute in 2022. So, I'd say that that momentum in the backdrop is still strong. Bruce mentioned that the macro was one of the areas as long as that keeps going. We do see some very solid momentum in the cap market business, M&A and loan syndications, where the leads in 4Q and the pipelines look very good into early '22 in terms of what we can see there. I'll make a comment on mortgage and then maybe just see if Don and Brendan want to add. But I mean, on mortgage, I would say the way to think about that is, yes, it'll be down. But I still think that given the investments we've made and the share that we've been able to take will be above pre-pandemic levels. So, the 2019 base year, I think 2022, you can think of that as being a year where we will solidify, normalize a bit in terms of volumes and say that maybe the markets down 30%, but our volumes will be down less than that. Margins are still a bit under pressure, in particular in the third-party space in production. But that is meaningfully offset by what's going on in the servicing side of the business where you see continued increase in UPBs for us. And as the rate rise is starting to take off here a little bit, you see lower amortization. So, you put all that together and you're going to have continued contributions for mortgage that will be greater than pre-pandemic. So maybe I'll just turn it to Don if he has anything else to add ...\nDon McCree: Yes. So, my perspective is assuming the market stay strong and we expect them to stay strong, so I think of that relatively low interest rates, lots of liquidity in a reasonable economy. That's a great backup for continued deals. We saw a lot of things try to run to the finish line in the fourth quarter due to potential changes in tax laws. But I have to say our pipelines are as high as they've ever been as we roll into the -- in the first quarter, and we expect those to continue to build. The other thing I just give you perspective on is, is we've got a diversification of revenue streams now in our capital markets business. And that is furthered by JMP, which moves us into the equity business as some industry -- interesting industry verticals. And then we have DH Capital, which should close sometime in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, which will give us incremental opportunities. And that's only just beginning to be realized. And the thing that's really driving the fee lines is we're playing multiple roles on every -- a lot of transactions now. So not only are we advising, but we're also financing and we're capturing the wealth business and there's a lot of very good cross-sell and a lot of value add for our clients. So, it feels very strong. I think we\u2019ve got an increasingly strong reputation with the private equity community, particularly in the middle market space as we show them these interesting opportunities and we execute well for them. So, it feels very good. What the exact number is going to be, it\u2019s very hard to tell. But sitting here in the second week of January, I'm pretty optimistic about what the year is going to look like.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, and on mortgage, I would just add that, obviously filling up at a high level, as you all know, mortgage is a natural hedge against the interest rate environment for us and while in many ways this cycle is a lot like other cycles, the differences that was exacerbated significantly. So, you\u2019ve got a much bigger path just given how quickly they came at us in COVID and you had a steeper decline. Having said that, John\u2019s point, we feel much better positioned than pre-COVID levels in 2019. I think you\u2019ll see in our results in 2022 despite us projecting the NBA and projecting the market down 30%, we should outpace our performance in '19, and that\u2019s with the backdrop of margins at historically low levels. So, I think the question for us is how much better will we be over time than our 2019 pre-COVID run rates, and a lot of that will have to do with how quickly margins re-normalizes, capacity leads the system. We are starting to see that now as rates pick up. Lenders are starting to shed capacity. We have not yet seen margin stabilize or certainly turnaround, but we expect that to happen at some point, question, because that happened in the first half of this year, second half of this year, we will see. But we feel very good that the underlying strength of the business is significantly better than 2019.\nBruce Van Saun: Let me just close and give everybody a shot here for your comment, for your question, Gerard. But if you just think about the long-term, amplifying Don's comments about where we are positioned in the commercial bank and capital markets, in particular, feel really, really good about what we've built out and the secular transfers, private equity pools of capital, they're increasing their ownership of U.S., companies and we're very well-positioned to cover those companies and provide services to them, and with the big middle market and mid corporate space that we have, we have an opportunity to connect the intermediation of capital from private equity to corporate America. And that\u2019s a trend that I think is going to stay in place for a long time and we\u2019re extremely well-positioned to capture that and drive revenue growth. So, we like what we put together and I think we're still scratching the surface of the potential of really gaining the synergies that come from what we\u2019ve assembled. And then to follow-up on Brendan's point, it was always important for us to really get a profitable and highly respected and good mortgage business in place, because if we want to be in our consumer bank, a trusted advisor on somebody\u2019s life journey, the mortgage is incredibly important product to individuals and so we\u2019ve now accomplish that. So, feel good about what we've done in the capital market space and what we\u2019ve done in the mortgage space. It\u2019s been a combination of organic investments as well as inorganic acquisitions. The one place that we are still kind of short of the mark that we haven\u2019t moved, so to speak to the other side of the river and get where we want to get to is in wealth, and it's not for lack of trying. So, we\u2019ve made significant organic investments there. We've had one successful acquisition with Clarfeld Advisors, which has gone very, very well and we are still in the hunt to see if we can put more together there to get us where we need to get to.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. I appreciate all the insights. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Go ahead please.\nTerry McEvoy: Good morning. A question for John. Could you just update us on the size of Citizens Access? And maybe how do you best use that product in a rising interest rate environment? And then the HSBC online platform, will the conversion there occur on the same pace and same timeline as via the bank itself?\nJohn Woods: Yes. So, with respect to the first question on Citizens Access, yes, we are in that kind of $4.5 billion, $5 billion range. Most of that is -- we've had some run-off in terms of the CD book \u2026\nBruce Van Saun: Intentional.\nJohn Woods: Yes, intentionally, yes, I mean, so when we went out with that, that was a balanced approach in terms of savings in CD offer and that was extremely successful in the third quarter of '18, and has really served us well and we are building on that, that platform. We've launched a national storefront on the back of that platform, where we've added the ability to start bundling mortgage and education loans in that storefront when you log on to Citizens Access. And so over time that will be -- again, a big driver of how we are distinctive with our deposit offerings and being able to broaden out the product set. And then the second half of the question was on HSBC \u2026\nBruce Van Saun: Coming across and timing.\nJohn Woods: Yes. And so that timing is mid-February. We feel really good about that. I think the -- that\u2019s almost $8 billion of deposits in middle of February, and so that\u2019s going to add a lot of cash to where we are at the end of the first quarter, and that\u2019s really, should be thought as well in the context of the Investors acquisition where we looked at those deals as one sort of entry into the New York Metro, not just strategically, but also financially because when you put those two things together, that\u2019s around an 80% or so LDR combined profile. So those deposits are there to be thought out in the context of the overall investors in HSBC acquisition.\nBruce Van Saun: Brendan, maybe you could just try to carve out the online aspect of HSBC, because that was another thing that really was intriguing when we had the opportunity to buy that business.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, absolutely. It does help us further accelerate our national scale with our online deposit platform. And to the question, the timing on the online integration will be the same exact timing is core branch network acquisition in mid that all happen again. There's a few small differences with the HSBC online platform from our Citizens Access. One is that the interest rates are actually a lot lower, they're at 15 basis points versus our Citizens Access is at 40 basis points. And one of the reasons why they are a little bit lower is that a handful of those customers had some minor connectivity to their physical channels and so we are maintaining that and making sure the customers have access to our new distribution footprint where they happen to be in our franchise. So, you can start to see the physical and digital worlds coming together in this strategy, but we view this as a significant accelerant to our national expansion plans and provides a great pool of customers for us to ultimately deepen with as we -- to John\u2019s point, we've expanded the storefront with mortgage and student loan refinancing as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We are going to add more products over the course of 2022. So, this is fertile ground for revenue growth that we did not put into our deal model.\nTerry McEvoy: Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you just remind us the impact on service charges and fees in 2022 expected from the rollout of the Peace of Mind product, the Citizens Peace of Mind?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, I can take that. So, the way to really think about this is opportunity cost of not re-inflating and so the Piece of Mind program that really is 24-hour grace is a third or fourth move we've made in addition to a handful of other moves, including student account that is completely protected from overdraft. We've got $5 overdraft past. We've got a once-a-year automatic forgiveness for customers in certain products, and now we've introduced Peace of Mind, which is essentially a 24-hour grace period and a great customer experience for all of our customers to empower them to avoid unnecessary fees. And we think the payback on this is quite strong, will be about year three where we breakeven and turn the corner for the revenue benefits to offset the fee shortfall that we\u2019re giving up. But really we expect the overdraft line to be flattish going forward it. It would have cost -- we would have been able to get on top of, call it $8 million to $10 million a quarter at a normalized market where stimulus benefits burn down. But we think it\u2019s the right thing to do the \u2026\nBruce Van Saun: Amount of $40 million opportunity.\nBrendan Coughlin: It\u2019s about $40 million opportunity cost annually. But that more than offsets over time with revenue benefits. And to John\u2019s comment, we've already seen a significant early indicators of positivity coming from our customer base. Call center and complaint volumes were down about 40% in this category and our NPS score, particularly with under 40 age customers has really started to increase right away and we just rolled this out in October. So, we\u2019re very, very pleased about it, about the early behavioral impacts from our customer base.\nTerry McEvoy: Thanks. Thanks, everyone.\nBrendan Coughlin: Sure.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. It looks like that\u2019s the end of the queue here for Q&A. I know it\u2019s a busy day with other banks reporting. But once again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thank you.\nOperator: And that will conclude your teleconference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $569 million and EPS of $1.26. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.6%, which included the impact of a credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 4% linked quarter, given strong growth in fee income. Average loans were up a solid 3% in the quarter, before the impact of PPP forgiveness, led by retail which is up by 4% and 3% growth in commercial. Overall spot loan growth of 5% for the quarter excluding PPP, provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year. Linked quarter fee growth was 16% or 10% before acquisitions, including outstanding results in capital markets, driven by record M&A fees and loan syndications as we've executed well and gained market share. And excluding the impact of the two commercial fee-based acquisitions we close in the second half, we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately 2% this quarter with well controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $25 million, which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy. Our year end ACL ratio stands at 1.51%, above our day one CECL level of 1.47%. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.9% after returning $360 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the fourth quarter, while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was down 2%, given lower net interest margin, partially offset by strong loan growth. The net interest margin was 2.66%, down 6 basis points reflecting a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness, and lower earning asset yields given changes in loan mix and spread compression, partially offset by the impact of lower cash balances as we redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. We also made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 1 basis point to 13 basis points. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see we remain highly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter with an overall sensitivity of 10.1% to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates. At the end of the year, about 60% of our sensitivity is geared towards the short end. So, we are well-positioned to benefit when the Fed begin to tighten. Referring to Slide 7, we delivered terrific fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses with outstanding results in capital markets. reflecting our long-term investments in the business and solid performance across other fee categories. We set a new record for quarterly capital markets with exceptional strength in M&A advisory and loan syndication fees, amid a backdrop of good market activity. We continue to gain market share and have nice momentum as we enter 2022. We also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in FX and IRP, which are up 21% linked quarter, given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust M&A activity and an increase in client hedging given the outlook for rate rises. Mortgage fees declined in the quarter against the backdrop of strong competition in excess industry capacity. We saw ongoing pressure on gain on sale margins, particularly in third-party channels and seasonally lower production volume. Mortgage servicing income improved as our third-party servicing book grew 3% linked quarter to $90 billion. Card fees were stable as debit transactions and credit card spend continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels, while fees also remain strong. Service charges and fees were modestly lower reflecting the impact of Citizens peace of mind, our new customer friendly deposit account feature. We are seeing these changes drive clear benefits from customer experience as customer satisfaction is up and call center volume is down since we implemented the changes. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled. Excluding the impact of the fee-based acquisitions that closed in the second half of the year, non-interest expense was stable, and we drove linked quarter operating leverage of about 2%. These results reflect higher incentive compensation types of strong capital markets revenue and strategic investments, which was balanced by strong expense discipline and the benefit of top efficiency initiatives. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 4% linked quarter or 5% excluding PPP. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth of more than 6% excluding PPP. Retail loans are also growing up 4%. Average loans were up 2% and up more than 3% excluding PPP. Retail strength was driven by mortgage and auto. Commercial originations were very strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels led by corporate banking, subscription line financing, supporting deal related activity and asset backed lending. After line utilizations levels ticked up last quarter, we saw a larger increase of about 270 basis points to 35% on the spot basis this quarter, primarily driven by deal related financing activity. We continue to expect a gradual recovery and utilization over the coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve. In addition, our period-end commitments are up a very strong 8% which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year with strong growth in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits, up from 30% last year. Interest bearing deposits were broadly stable as the continued runoff of higher cost of term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lower cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit repricing with interest bearing deposit costs down 1 basis point to 13 basis points during the quarter. Given the changing tone of the Fed and the potential that they may begin to tighten earlier -- early this year, we thought it would be helpful to make a few points about how we see our deposit costs behaving in the next rate cycle. First, we've made significant improvements to our deposit related capabilities since the IPO. Our enhanced data analytics capabilities allow us to optimize the deposit base by attracting more stable deposits with targeted offers and by employing more dynamic pricing. We also have the added lever of Citizens Access, which was proven to be a very efficient deposit channel. And we have strengthened our commercial offerings and invested in enhanced tools to drive higher operating deposits. Secondly, our mix of lower cost deposits is much better with demand deposits now 32% of the book, compared to 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And consumer CDs, which were at 14% of total deposits at the end of the last cycle are now down to 3%, which is below peer levels. Also note that the HSBC branch acquisition will add almost $8 billion or 5% to our core deposits when we close this quarter. Lastly, we have vastly improved our overall liquidity profile with a lower LDR and much lower deposit costs than when we entered the last rate cycle. When you add that all up, we are confident that our deposit base will be meaningful low -- meaningfully lower than the prior cycle. Moving on to credit on Slide 11. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter. Net charge-offs were broadly stable at 14 basis points for the fourth quarter with good performance across the portfolio. Nonperforming loans decreased 6% linked quarter with continued improvement in commercial. Other credit metrics continue to improve as criticized loans were lower and internal ratings upgrades exceeded downgrades. Moving to Slide 12. We maintained an excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remain strong at 9.9% at the end of the fourth quarter, after returning $360 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and closing the JMP acquisition. On the bottom right of the page, we expect a 22 basis point impact to CET1 from the pending HSBC acquisitions, and the ISPC transaction will be effectively neutral given the stock to be issued in the deal. Shifting gears towards business strategy a bit, we thought it would be useful to have Brendan and Don discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway and how we are poised for strong and sustainable growth. Brendan, over to you. Thanks, Don. On Slide 16, you'll see some examples of the tremendous progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives that Brendan and Don mentioned, and other what we're doing across the Bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. We are very excited to see how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Moving to Slide 17, I'll touch on our TOP programs. Even as we intended to offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous efforts to realize efficiencies and reinvest these savings back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively wrapped up our TOP six programs after achieving our targeted pre-tax run rate benefits of approximately $425million at the end of 2021. Now we have launched TOP 7 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022. We are really doubling back to mine areas where we have already been successful. For example, continuing our multiyear journey of digital transformation across consumer and commercial, looking at further organizational streamlining, accelerating and building on our next gen tech initiatives and doing more in the cloud. We're going to focus on maturing our agile operating model and take another look at our vendor spend as well. Based on the work we've done so far, we feel confident that we can deliver on this new program. Moving to Slide 18, we made a lot of progress on the ESG front last year, and we will continue to make meaningful progress in 2022. A few highlights for the launch of a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact. We adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We have a strong commitment to social equity, and our colleagues continue a tradition of being highly focused on volunteering in our communities. To serve our clients better, we introduced new deposit account features that help customers avoid unexpected overdraft fees, and we immediately saw changes that indicate a meaningful improvement in customer experience. This should help attract and keep more customers with the bank. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook for full year 2022 on Slide 19. First, let me be clear that this is a standalone outlook that includes JMP and Willamette, which closed late last year, but does not include any benefit from our pending acquisitions of HSBC and Investors. The bottom left corner of the page includes information that should help if you're trying to also layer in the expected contribution from these acquisitions in 2022. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by mid-single-digit average loan growth. Excluding PPP, we expect NII to grow high single digits driven by high single-digit average loan growth. Average interest earning assets are expected to be up slightly as excess liquidity is deployed into loan growth. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of January 5, and includes three implied Fed rate hikes of 25 basis points each in April, July and December. On the long end, we are planning for the 10-year treasury to be about 1.9% by the end of the year. The rate curve benefit on net interest margin will allow us to be to more than offset the 2022 impacts from lower PPP forgiveness and swap revenue, while presenting meaningful upside to NIM in 2023 and beyond. Fee income is expected to be up 4% to 7% given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performances in 2021. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 5% to 6% given the full year effect of our commercial fee-based acquisitions, or up less than 3% excluding the impact of these acquisitions. We have included an expense walk on Slide 24, that lays out the drivers. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly and provision expense is less than net charge-offs. And we plan to continue operating with a CET1 ratio within our target range of 9.75% to 10%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. On the lower left of the slide, you'll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of HSBC and Investors with EPS accretion of about 5% based on consensus at the time of announcing and approximately $475 million in additional PPNR to our 2022 results. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis point -- basis for the year, including HSBC and Investors. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be a very strong 5% operating leverage. Moving to Slide 20, I'll cover the outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be down about 1% despite solid loan growth, given a $20 million smaller contribution from PPP, and an $18 million impact from lower data, including the impact of HSBC, NII will be broadly stable for the quarter. Average loans are expected to be up 2% to 3% with interest bearing assets broadly stable. Fees are expected to be down 8% to 12%, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets fees than the record we delivered last quarter, as well as see other seasonal impacts. Non-interest expense is expected to be up approximately 6% given seasonal compensation impacts and the full quarter impact of the JMP acquisition. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable with provision less than net-charge offs. And we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%, including an impact of about 22 basis points from the HSBC transaction, which we expect to close in the quarter. To sum up with Slide 21, we feel that we finished 2021 with a great quarter and entered 2022 with strong momentum. We have a winning strategy. We are building capabilities organic -- organically and through acquisitions that deliver value to our customers and growth for our shareholders. Our strong leadership team will continue to focus on execution and building a top-performing bank. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Yes, I think that's well said. I would just add that as it relates to the operational side of things, we've got a number of mock conversions and dress rehearsals that have gone extremely well. The last one is, I think, next weekend. So, we're right on schedule for HSBC, for that closing conversion in middle of February. So that's really sort of well-handled and we're deep into the planning on Investors as well, planning for legal day one planning for customer day one planning for conversion and those plans are also well insight and appear well able to be executed. On the balance sheet aspects that Bruce mentioned, and just reemphasizing our front book originations will look different than the backlog. The backlog has the multifamily loan portfolios as Bruce indicated, but that front book is going to have a lot more C&I and a lot more consumer lending going forward than Investors has had in the past. So, with that, I'll go ahead and leave it there. Yes, I'm going to talk about that. I mean, I think we are highly asset sensitive. And that's built into the guide for NII for 2022. Based on the Gen 5 curve. And as you know, since then, the curve has increased a fair bit as of -- as just looking at it were things ended up yesterday. So, there's more upside in 2022, if the rate environment continues to unfold as we're seeing it in the last several days. But as it relates to the actual sensitivity, the way that shakes out is that on the show, we're mostly sensitive to the short end and that'll drive about $20 million if there's a -- if there's an extra 25 basis points. On top of the forward curves as of January 5, we'll generate another $20 million per quarter on that -- on the short end, and we'll get another 10 to 15 per quarter on the long end versus the January 5 forward curve for an overall $30 million to $35 million per quarter of additional benefit, if you have 25 basis points ... ... that require -- yes, on a parallel shift up from the Gen 5 curve. As it relates to deposit betas. I mean, this is a very exciting story. I mean, we've completely transformed the deposit franchise since the IPO. And I would say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think that our deposit betas are going to be meaningfully lower in this next cycle. And, of course, we just start off the cycle, it's all -- there's a lag. And we've got that lag built in, but we also have some betas built in. But I would say that the 2022 betas at the beginning of this cycle are going to be much lower than the betas that we experienced at the beginning of the rate rise cycle last time around, given all the investments we made and product capability in pricing, and an approach and with the added level of Citizens Access. So, we're really excited about being able to demonstrate the strength of the deposit franchise in this cycle going forward. Exactly. Yes, I'll go ahead and start. As it relates to -- we're targeting towards the end of '23 when we'll have substantially all the synergies done. And as I mentioned, we're going to close our convert HSBC here in February. The expectation is our target is to close Investors in early first quarter, early April. And I would say the way to think about conversion is that that's not going to be a big bang approach. We're going to see that conversions happen throughout on a staged and phased basis throughout 2022, assuming we close in early April, you will see a couple of platforms closed throughout 2022 and into the end of 2022. And there could be some stragglers into the early part of 2023. But again, it's not going to be a big bang. We're going to move certain platforms over as they become ready to go. And I think for - as an example, mortgage and wealth are two platforms that will go early and the overall core what happened later. So maybe I'll just -- maybe turn it over to others if they want to add any color to that. I will just start off. And as you may know, I mean, we've talked about the C4, our capital priorities start off with a dividend and supporting organic growth and fee-based bolt-ons. And so, we want to put capital to work in that manner. And to the extent that that those opportunities, we leave some capital around, then we engage in buybacks, which we did this quarter, or this past quarter, 4Q, as we articulated in our remarks. So, I mean, I think we're coming into CCAR season, and we tend to, on an annual basis, take another look at capital targets, and what the trajectory of capital return will be. We also have the deals that are pending. So, I think you'll get -- we can be a little bit more sort of give another update on that as you get into the first quarter call. Maybe I will just start off and Don can weigh in here. I mean, I think as we mentioned, corporate banking and subscription line finance and asset backed lending all contributed, and it has been an excellent quarter and there is momentum with spot balances higher than average. So that's right, John. I would say when you split it out, we are seeing -- last quarter we saw it tick up in utilization from our sort of bread-and-butter corporate banking clients. This quarter, we saw another tick up. In that sense, a lot of the increase was driven by deal financing, but we are seeing some underlying tick up maybe 50 basis points last quarter, another 50 or so this quarter. Maybe I'll just turn it over to Don to add any additional color. Good morning. Yes, I'll start off and turn it over to Don and Brendan, if they want to add any further color. But I mean, I think if we had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter, taking share and kind of climbing the lead tables, this was a result of multiyear kind of meticulous investments organically with some fee-based bolt-ons that are coming together. And frankly, haven't really fully achieved its potential in some respects in terms of synergies from the deals that we've done, et cetera, that are that are going to contribute in 2022. So, I'd say that that momentum in the backdrop is still strong. Bruce mentioned that the macro was one of the areas as long as that keeps going. We do see some very solid momentum in the cap market business, M&A and loan syndications, where the leads in 4Q and the pipelines look very good into early '22 in terms of what we can see there. I'll make a comment on mortgage and then maybe just see if Don and Brendan want to add. But I mean, on mortgage, I would say the way to think about that is, yes, it'll be down. But I still think that given the investments we've made and the share that we've been able to take will be above pre-pandemic levels. So, the 2019 base year, I think 2022, you can think of that as being a year where we will solidify, normalize a bit in terms of volumes and say that maybe the markets down 30%, but our volumes will be down less than that. Margins are still a bit under pressure, in particular in the third-party space in production. But that is meaningfully offset by what's going on in the servicing side of the business where you see continued increase in UPBs for us. And as the rate rise is starting to take off here a little bit, you see lower amortization. So, you put all that together and you're going to have continued contributions for mortgage that will be greater than pre-pandemic. So maybe I'll just turn it to Don if he has anything else to add ... Yes. So, with respect to the first question on Citizens Access, yes, we are in that kind of $4.5 billion, $5 billion range. Most of that is -- we've had some run-off in terms of the CD book ... Yes, intentionally, yes, I mean, so when we went out with that, that was a balanced approach in terms of savings in CD offer and that was extremely successful in the third quarter of '18, and has really served us well and we are building on that, that platform. We've launched a national storefront on the back of that platform, where we've added the ability to start bundling mortgage and education loans in that storefront when you log on to Citizens Access. And so over time that will be -- again, a big driver of how we are distinctive with our deposit offerings and being able to broaden out the product set. And then the second half of the question was on HSBC ... Yes. And so that timing is mid-February. We feel really good about that. I think the -- that's almost $8 billion of deposits in middle of February, and so that's going to add a lot of cash to where we are at the end of the first quarter, and that's really, should be thought as well in the context of the Investors acquisition where we looked at those deals as one sort of entry into the New York Metro, not just strategically, but also financially because when you put those two things together, that's around an 80% or so LDR combined profile. So those deposits are there to be thought out in the context of the overall investors in HSBC acquisition."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Okay. Good stuff, Brendan. Let me shift to our commercial priorities which were on Slide 15. We've added some great talent to the commercial bank on both the coverage side as well as the product side, and we're able to do more for our customers over their life cycle than ever before. We've been near the top of the middle market league tables helping corporate clients and private equity sponsors access capital to private and public debt and equity markets. And we've integrated our cash management and global market solutions well with our coverage teams. On the coverage side, we're expanding geographically and moving upmarket into the mid corporate space where it's critical to deliver deep industry expertise. Our JMP acquisition, which closed late last year, gives us a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, health care and financial services. Plus, we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded and we're already seeing great cross-sell dividends off of it. As non-bank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continue to increase, we've broadened our capabilities to better compete successfully in the new landscape. We will increase -- we increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base given these expanded capabilities. It's also worth noting that Willamette, the transaction we closed mid last year dramatically expands our valuation services business with a very prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort and has annuity like qualities. So, you can see the success we've had in building and scaling up our businesses to deliver more than just traditional banking products to our clients. We are highly confident that this list will continue to drive sustainable and growing revenue streams. Over to you, John. I think that's right. I think the big macro is our origination volumes are just huge, record quarter on quarter on quarter. And they've been offset by payoffs as people go into the capital markets or and in particular real estate, a lot of properties are trading. So, we're being taken out of loans due to underlying property sales. But we're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the origination side. The subscription line business that we have is really going quite well. It's growing quite quickly. Some of the deal financing that happened in the fourth quarter will be refinanced out in the capital markets probably which is good for us because we will participate in that. But we think the trend continues. The other thing that we are seeing is a lot of activity in our real estate business on the origination side. We're seeing quite a bit of warehousing, quite a bit of industrial, quite a bit of life sciences and then increasingly build a suit office, believe it or not. So, investment grade corporates building new office space to occupy post pandemic. In terms of working capital and CapEx and things like that, it's really hard to kind of discern how quickly that's going to happen. You've got the new supply chain challenges, you've got some of the labor challenges, you get some of the international countries shutting down. So, it's kind of fits and starts, but we think it's -- it feels pretty good to us overall. Yes. So, my perspective is assuming the market stay strong and we expect them to stay strong, so I think of that relatively low interest rates, lots of liquidity in a reasonable economy. That's a great backup for continued deals. We saw a lot of things try to run to the finish line in the fourth quarter due to potential changes in tax laws. But I have to say our pipelines are as high as they've ever been as we roll into the -- in the first quarter, and we expect those to continue to build. The other thing I just give you perspective on is, is we've got a diversification of revenue streams now in our capital markets business. And that is furthered by JMP, which moves us into the equity business as some industry -- interesting industry verticals. And then we have DH Capital, which should close sometime in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, which will give us incremental opportunities. And that's only just beginning to be realized. And the thing that's really driving the fee lines is we're playing multiple roles on every -- a lot of transactions now. So not only are we advising, but we're also financing and we're capturing the wealth business and there's a lot of very good cross-sell and a lot of value add for our clients. So, it feels very strong. I think we've got an increasingly strong reputation with the private equity community, particularly in the middle market space as we show them these interesting opportunities and we execute well for them. So, it feels very good. What the exact number is going to be, it's very hard to tell. But sitting here in the second week of January, I'm pretty optimistic about what the year is going to look like."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call. We are pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full year. And we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum through 2022. The investments that we've made to transform and reposition Citizens since our IPO are really bearing fruit. Our customer centric approach, backed by a full range of product offerings and strong digital data and technology capabilities has allowed us to gain market share, deepen relationships with customers, and develop sustainable growth opportunities. We've navigated the pandemic environment well, shifting to offense over the course of 2021 to accelerate our strategy, including five acquisitions as we strive to build a unique and special top performing bank.  I'll comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying earnings per share was $1.26 and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%. Sequential operating leverage was 1.5%, that's 1.8% ex acquisitions and sequential growth in PPNR was a strong 6%. Leading our performance was an unbelievably strong quarter in our capital markets business, led by M&A and loan syndications. We built a great business through hiring top talent in combination with several acquisitions, and our approach to market is really clicking. For the quarter, we were number one in the league table for middle market sponsor transactions and number four for overall middle market. We only had JMP results for six weeks of the quarter, but we're very excited about how they'll augment what we've already assembled. Our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of 4% on a spot basis, 5% ex PPP, while average growth was 2% and that's 3% ex PPP. Commercial growth and a pickup in line utilization were bright spots, and we enter 2022 with a good jump off point. We did a nice job on expenses pulling across our top efficiency saves to help offset higher incentive comp tied to revenues. And credit remains pristine as good as it gets. Our capital position remains strong with CET1 ratio of 9.9% giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2022. We have the capital and liquidity to fund the attractive loan growth we expect to see in 2022\u0323, while looking for selective acquisitions and ensuring strong returns of capital to shareholders. With respect to our guidance for 2022, we assume solid economic growth of around 4%, several fed rate hikes and improvement in loan demands. Our top six and top seven programs should allow us to keep expense growth ex acquisitions below 3% and we're targeting 2% positive operating leverage, including the bank yield scheduled to close soon, and almost 5% ex PPP impact. Credit is expected to continue to be highly favorable, and I'd expect our return on tangible common equity to move over 14% in the second half of the year, potentially reaching 15% in Q4. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2021, and we feel we are well-positioned to do well in 2022 and continue our journey towards becoming a top performing bank. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2021. We know we can count on you again in the new year. So, with that, I'll turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A. Let me start and John, you can jump in. So, it's Bruce. Peter, I think we're working really well and hard to make sure that these deals come off very smoothly. Customers have a good experience and we can introduce our approach to banking right off the bat and take advantage of, I think, some really great synergy opportunities. So, we've set up a separate integration office. We've had outside help -- helping us through and put dedicated teams to make sure that we get off to a good start. So, I don't really see any disruption from smoothness of operations. I think that'll come off very, very well. We're monitoring the performance of both businesses, and they seem to be performing to our expectations. So that's also a good fact. We will end up taking on more commercial real estate exposure when Investors closes. However, most of that is in multifamily, and the kind of risk of that portfolio is relatively modest in terms on the spectrum of commercial real estate risks. So, I think we'll look to grow our other loan categories faster over time, which will bring kind of that exposure back into more alignment of where a targeted balance sheet would be. But we don't think there'll be any need to do any dramatic surgery or anything that would disrupt the momentum that we have in loan growth. So, I'll stop there and, John, if you want to add anything to that? It's a parallel shift. Yes. Just to quantify that a little bit, if you look at the last move up 2% on Fed funds and then you compare to if that happened today, we'd probably be a third less in terms of our deposit betas than we were last time around. Okay. I think that's right, John. Yes. And, Ken, just from a technical standpoint, we had an authorization to buy back 750 million of our stock. And we've used about 300 of that to date that we have 450 left for this year, which should give us plenty of running room. When we get through CCAR, you might see us do an adjustment to that. But anyway, that's a little bit of the framework that we're operating under. Yep. Good morning, Pan. Sure. So, I like our size, John. So, I think we have enough scale that we can compete against all comers. We have to be extremely disciplined. We have to prioritize well, we have to leverage the external parties, our principal core application vendors, we have a lot of partnerships with Fintechs. But we do a really good job there and we're moving the company to be a digital first bank and I like the progress there. So, one of the advantages you have if you're not super big, not in the mega bank weight classes, that you can be more nimble, and you can move faster and you can stay focused on the things that really matter. So, scale does help to some degree. So doing this New York Metro play and picking up another $30 billion of assets, I think is a positive, but we don't feel compelled to have to run out and do more deals to stay competitive. Was there a second part of your question, John? Yes, right. Yes, so there I think we have a pretty unique opportunity because we have a deposit franchise, its national with Citizens Access. We do have consumer lending activities that are national. And we've basically gone to market in a -- in kind of a product siloed fashion without a fully comprehensive platform that allows us to deliver a full range of products and services to customers. So that's been really our focus, and we put it under the umbrella of national expansion. We think there's a really good opportunity to migrate to a cloud-based digital platform that delivers great customer experience, and then leverage that to target specific, very highly specific customer segments where we think we have a right to win. And when we look at what we do really well in our regional core footprint, that's mass affluent customers, particularly young professionals. We have a great offering there. It starts with our student loan refinance product, and we dropped a bunch of things in around that. So, we think we can target that segment around the country, once we pull this all together, and make some real headway. What goes with that is, right now we're largely all digital with that national play. We will pick up some branches in the Washington DC area when HSBC closes and some in South Florida. That'll give us an opportunity to go digital first into those markets combined with a light physical presence, and do some tests and learning because there may be other attractive cities around the country where we have a concentration of customers or calling base, so we have more brand visibility where we might decide to open some branches and then see how that could augment our push to really attract those customers and gain primacy with those customers. So, a lot of play out on this, but it's very exciting. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add anything to that. Hi, Gerard. Yes. To me, Gerard, it's usually around the macro would be the principal risks. So as the macro goes, it certainly has a big impact on bank results. It looks like the kind of Omicron wave is not as lethal as feared, and it has an interrupted business and commerce and people's behavior as much as it could have as much as prior waves did. So, I put that as a tick in the plus column, although you never know what could happen later on over the course of the year. I do think the Fed has a fine balancing act to achieve here and bringing inflation under control. Inflation is really something to be feared, and the Fed is going to aggressively combat that. And hopefully, they apply the medicine in a good pace with good kind of forewarning in the market adjusts to that. It doesn't kind of snuff out the signs of a good recovery, we think that GDP could grow at 4%. But what could happen if the market doesn't respond well to those rate increases, or if the equity market falls a bit because of that. So that's another thing. I think the fiscal situation seems stable at this point. It's going to be hard, I think, to pass more legislative initiatives that increase fiscal spend. And I think the spend that we have built up from prior rounds of fiscal stimulus is sufficient to carry us through. So anyway, those are some of the things that we've watched. I still feel that the fundamental underpinning is very good and the credit outlook is very good. So, I think there's a strong probability that this turns out to be a good year, but there's always that tail risks that stuff could happen. And that's the thing that we watched carefully. Let me just close and give everybody a shot here for your comment, for your question, Gerard. But if you just think about the long-term, amplifying Don's comments about where we are positioned in the commercial bank and capital markets, in particular, feel really, really good about what we've built out and the secular transfers, private equity pools of capital, they're increasing their ownership of U.S., companies and we're very well-positioned to cover those companies and provide services to them, and with the big middle market and mid corporate space that we have, we have an opportunity to connect the intermediation of capital from private equity to corporate America. And that's a trend that I think is going to stay in place for a long time and we're extremely well-positioned to capture that and drive revenue growth. So, we like what we put together and I think we're still scratching the surface of the potential of really gaining the synergies that come from what we've assembled. And then to follow-up on Brendan's point, it was always important for us to really get a profitable and highly respected and good mortgage business in place, because if we want to be in our consumer bank, a trusted advisor on somebody's life journey, the mortgage is incredibly important product to individuals and so we've now accomplish that. So, feel good about what we've done in the capital market space and what we've done in the mortgage space. It's been a combination of organic investments as well as inorganic acquisitions. The one place that we are still kind of short of the mark that we haven't moved, so to speak to the other side of the river and get where we want to get to is in wealth, and it's not for lack of trying. So, we've made significant organic investments there. We've had one successful acquisition with Clarfeld Advisors, which has gone very, very well and we are still in the hunt to see if we can put more together there to get us where we need to get to. Intentional. Coming across and timing. Brendan, maybe you could just try to carve out the online aspect of HSBC, because that was another thing that really was intriguing when we had the opportunity to buy that business. Amount of $40 million opportunity. Okay. It looks like that's the end of the queue here for Q&A. I know it's a busy day with other banks reporting. But once again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thank you."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. On Slide 13, you can see we've dramatically transformed the Consumer Bank since the IPO and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future. Let me share a few highlights. We're acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the U.S., nearly doubling our customer base from approximately 3 million at the time of our IPO to 6.4 million today. Further, our mobile engagement is up 15% year-over-year closing gaps to peers and allow us to thin our physical network by another 8% this year, about 20% since our IPO. This enables us to reinvest in growth strategies. We built one of the most diversified consumer lending businesses in the U.S., giving us a number of additional levers for revenue growth and customer deepening that many of our peer banks lack. We've transformed our deposit book, repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong DDA growth, which has really driven down our cost of funds by about 75% compared with the time of our IPO. Finally, while we have more work to do, our wealth business has been repositioned for growth, and our AUM is more than 3x the size at the time of the IPO. So, 5 years ago, we were very much a traditional regional only bank. We have strong momentum in the business, have broadly caught up with peers and in a number of places have built best in market capabilities that have lived to differentiated growth rates. Moving on to Slide 14 and looking forward, we prioritized several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver above trend revenue growth, adding about $1 billion by the year five. First, we expect to leverage our acquisitions in New York Metro markets to grow share and deepen relationships. We will pick up almost 1 million new customers who have been underserved given that their current banks don't have the breadth of product capabilities that we have. There is strong upside if we can replicate in New York, what we had done in our core markets like Philadelphia and Boston. The second area is wealth, where we have a great opportunity as well. We've recently attracted a new and strong leadership team with a long track record of industry success, our regional footprint, and our bank customer base is highly attractive and provide significant opportunity for sustained growth. Third, our Citizens Pay offering is unique amongst all the industry players in the fast growing buy now pay later space. We were early movers in the space starting with the Apple partnership in 2015. We built a very strong position now with 44 partners. We've added industry verticals and have remained focused on getting marquee partners providing good momentum, and with a strong pipeline for 2022. Lastly, our national push will be led by our digital capabilities and that includes our efforts to build on the Citizens Access launch in 2018, and the integration of our full range of products and services on a modern cloud-based platform. We'll continue to add products to the platform in '22 and we'll aim to drive improved customer deepening. We will also leverage the strategy to accelerate our technology transformation of our core bank, as we ultimately aim to converge the operating platforms into one national digital first structure. Now let me pass it over to Don. Well said. I guess I just -- the color as that ties into scale for me is while we don't feel like we are required to get scale, I think the digital first world is providing an opportunity to scale distinctively with revenue. In my opening remarks as part of our call script you see us going from 3 million customers to 6 million customers since our IPO, I would argue that in a pre-digital world that was not possible without M&A activity and we've got a demonstrated track record of scaling our consumer business organically. And so that's what you should think about as we bring together all our product capabilities nationally is how do we get scale and provide distinctive revenue opportunity without necessarily needing to do a big M&A acquisition. We have confidence we can do that. Obviously, we're supplementing that with HSBC and Investors. But really, we think we can get great customer growth and deepening organically. The good question is, do you need physical presence over time and what does that physical presence look like? And can you run it with a thin network to Bruce's point around piloting in Washington DC and Florida and then potentially other markets over time. But all paths lead to the next 18 months or so, we're really building on our exceptional mobile first digital platform nationally, and then we can start to think through our distribution opportunities over time. Yes, and on mortgage, I would just add that, obviously filling up at a high level, as you all know, mortgage is a natural hedge against the interest rate environment for us and while in many ways this cycle is a lot like other cycles, the differences that was exacerbated significantly. So, you've got a much bigger path just given how quickly they came at us in COVID and you had a steeper decline. Having said that, John's point, we feel much better positioned than pre-COVID levels in 2019. I think you'll see in our results in 2022 despite us projecting the NBA and projecting the market down 30%, we should outpace our performance in '19, and that's with the backdrop of margins at historically low levels. So, I think the question for us is how much better will we be over time than our 2019 pre-COVID run rates, and a lot of that will have to do with how quickly margins re-normalizes, capacity leads the system. We are starting to see that now as rates pick up. Lenders are starting to shed capacity. We have not yet seen margin stabilize or certainly turnaround, but we expect that to happen at some point, question, because that happened in the first half of this year, second half of this year, we will see. But we feel very good that the underlying strength of the business is significantly better than 2019. Yes, absolutely. It does help us further accelerate our national scale with our online deposit platform. And to the question, the timing on the online integration will be the same exact timing is core branch network acquisition in mid that all happen again. There's a few small differences with the HSBC online platform from our Citizens Access. One is that the interest rates are actually a lot lower, they're at 15 basis points versus our Citizens Access is at 40 basis points. And one of the reasons why they are a little bit lower is that a handful of those customers had some minor connectivity to their physical channels and so we are maintaining that and making sure the customers have access to our new distribution footprint where they happen to be in our franchise. So, you can start to see the physical and digital worlds coming together in this strategy, but we view this as a significant accelerant to our national expansion plans and provides a great pool of customers for us to ultimately deepen with as we -- to John's point, we've expanded the storefront with mortgage and student loan refinancing as I mentioned in my opening remarks. We are going to add more products over the course of 2022. So, this is fertile ground for revenue growth that we did not put into our deal model. Yes, I can take that. So, the way to really think about this is opportunity cost of not re-inflating and so the Piece of Mind program that really is 24-hour grace is a third or fourth move we've made in addition to a handful of other moves, including student account that is completely protected from overdraft. We've got $5 overdraft past. We've got a once-a-year automatic forgiveness for customers in certain products, and now we've introduced Peace of Mind, which is essentially a 24-hour grace period and a great customer experience for all of our customers to empower them to avoid unnecessary fees. And we think the payback on this is quite strong, will be about year three where we breakeven and turn the corner for the revenue benefits to offset the fee shortfall that we're giving up. But really we expect the overdraft line to be flattish going forward it. It would have cost -- we would have been able to get on top of, call it $8 million to $10 million a quarter at a normalized market where stimulus benefits burn down. But we think it's the right thing to do the ... It's about $40 million opportunity cost annually. But that more than offsets over time with revenue benefits. And to John's comment, we've already seen a significant early indicators of positivity coming from our customer base. Call center and complaint volumes were down about 40% in this category and our NPS score, particularly with under 40 age customers has really started to increase right away and we just rolled this out in October. So, we're very, very pleased about it, about the early behavioral impacts from our customer base. Sure."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of third quarter results, referencing our presentation, which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking; and Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, are also here to provide additional color. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements which is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliation in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We had a successful and busy third quarter, featuring continued strong execution of our strategic initiatives, good financial performance with positive operating leverage and 7% sequential PPNR growth and the announcement of three acquisitions. By playing offense, and we feel that we are taking the steps to position us for solid growth in franchise value, in earnings and in returns. Our financial performance in Q3 reflects strong revenue growth of 3% sequentially as both net interest income and fees grew nicely. NII benefited from a pickup in soft loan growth with retail up 3% and commercial up 1%, excluding PPP impact from loan forgiveness. The gradual improvement in loan volumes we have expected is materializing though held back a modest amount in Q3 by impacts from the Delta variant on the recovery as well as by supply chain issues and labor shortages. These impacts should continue to abate going forward, and we expect even faster loan growth in Q4. Interestingly, the amount of PPP forgiveness is roughly equivalent in the first and second halves of 2021, though Q3 saw a meaningful pull forward, which benefits Q3 at the expense of Q4. Nonetheless, the faster loan growth we expect in Q4 should largely offset the lower PPP impact on Q4 net interest income. Strong sequential fee growth once again demonstrated the diversity of our business model. Mortgage had a bounce-back quarter, which helped offset some seasonality in capital market fees, while Wealth hit a new record and consumer fees continued their recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect this diversification to play out again in Q4 with Capital Markets poised for a strong quarter, given exceptional pipelines and Mortgage set for a seasonally softer quarter. We kept expenses under control given our efficiency initiatives, which led to positive sequential operating leverage of around 2.5%. And credit continues to be in great shape, with NCOs of 14 basis points in the quarter, well below our guidance range for the quarter of 20 to 25 basis points. These strong results across expenses and credit should continue into Q4. The strategic initiatives we're focused on across consumer and commercial continue to go well, and there's more on that in the presentation. We feel we are focused on prioritizing the areas where we can differentiate ourselves and where we have a right to win. The acquisitions we've announced year-to-date are all attractive from a strategic and financial standpoint, and present only modest execution risk. The investors in HSBC transactions give us a top 10 deposit market share in New York City Metro and over 1 million new customers who collectively we feel we can do more for. We also gained a big augmentation to our digital bank customer base from HSBC's online bank, and we gained a thin branch network in Washington, D.C. and Miami. Our integration efforts so far are progressing nicely. Our JMP acquisition is also strategically compelling. Upon closing the deal in mid-Q4, we'll have a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, healthcare and financial services, plus we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded. As nonbank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continues to increase, it's important that we broaden our capabilities to be able to compete successfully in this new landscape. We will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base, given these expanded capabilities. Also worth noting is that the Willamette transaction dramatically expands our valuation services business with a prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort. So to sum up, we're taking serious strides forward as an organization in 2021 and we feel very good about our positioning and our future outlook. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $546 million and EPS of $1.22. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.2%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3% linked quarter, given growth in both fee income and net interest income. Period-end loans were up 1% in the quarter with strong originations in retail and commercial. Loans were up 2%, excluding PPP forgiveness, giving us good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Key highlights include strong results in Capital Markets, notwithstanding seasonality, another strong quarter for Wealth and a rebound in Mortgage fees, and we delivered positive sequential operating leverage of over 2% this quarter with well-controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $33 million, which reflects strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.65% excluding PPP loans. We are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $167 million to shareholders and dividends during the quarter. And finally, we continue to grow our tangible book value per share which was $34.44 at quarter end, up 7% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the third quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2% linked quarter given interest-earning asset growth, stable net interest margin and higher day count. The net interest margin was 2.72%, flat sequentially as the benefit of accelerated PPP forgiveness and improved funding costs were offset by the impact of higher cash balances as well as lower earning asset yields given low rates. One highlight is our continued progress on lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points. Our asset sensitivity decreased to about 9.8% from 10.7% at the end of the second quarter. The decrease primarily reflects loan and deposit exchanges and the addition of $2.5 billion in received fixed spots in the quarter. We saw good entry points for the swaps given some steepening in the yield curve. So far in the fourth quarter, we have added another $1.25 billion. The hedging actions we've executed to-date in 2021 are one of the levers we are pulling to address headwinds from swap runoff and other impacts of the low rate environment. We expect to continue adding to receive fixed swap portfolio and further moderate our asset sensitivity as the curve steepens while maintaining meaningful upside benefit to higher short-term rates. Referring to Slide 7. We delivered solid fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee income with strong results in Capital Markets and Wealth. Mortgage fees rebounded in the quarter, up $23 million as production fees benefited from lower agency fees, and we saw improvement in MSR hedge results. Diving further into this performance, production revenue was up $12 million linked quarter, benefiting from a modest improvement in gain on sale margins across channels, given improved agency pricing and favorable execution. This was partially offset by a decline in adjusted lock volume, down sequentially about 10%, which is broadly in line with industry level trends. As expected, we continue to see a shift towards purchase originations, which increased from about 48% of the total in second quarter to about 54% in the third quarter. The contribution from servicing operations decreased $4 million linked quarter, reflecting higher MSR amortization. Our third-party servicing book grew to $87 billion, up 3% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Lastly, our MSR hedging results improved $15 million linked quarter given an unusually large negative result in Q2. Capital Markets were down a bit from record levels, reflecting seasonality, particularly in syndication fees. However, M&A advisory fees were higher and our pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is exceptionally strong. Wealth fees were up slightly, continuing to build on record levels, reflecting an increase in assets under management from net inflows. Moving on to other positive fee contributors. We saw improvements in service charges and fees and card fees, which benefited from the strengthening economy as debit transactions and credit card spend, continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter as good expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives largely offset higher operational and travel costs. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 1% linked quarter or 2% excluding PPP. Retail loans are growing, up 3% and commercial loans were up 1%, excluding PPP in a tough operating environment. Average loans were down 1%, but still up 1%, excluding PPP. Diving into drivers a bit more. The diversity of our retail lending business produced another quarter of record origination though we continue to see high payouts. Strength was noteworthy in mortgage, auto and education. Commercial has seen strong underlying activity with spot loans up 1% in the quarter, excluding PPP. We had a very robust origination quarter led by commercial real estate, asset-backed lending and subscription line financing supporting deal-related activity. This was largely offset by continued elevated payoff activity, which in part reflects favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets. Line utilization levels were up around 50 basis points still near historic lows. We foresee a gradual recovery in coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve themselves. In addition, our period-end commitments are up around 2%, which will benefit us down the road once investment picks up. Overall soft loan growth of 2% for the quarter ex-PPP provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the fourth quarter. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year with strong demand in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and low-cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit re-pricing, with total deposit costs down 2 basis points to 9 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points during the quarter with opportunity to reduce further. Moving on to credit on Slide 11 and 12, we saw excellent credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs dropped from 25 basis points to 14 basis points for the third quarter, driven by improvements across the portfolio. Nonaccrual loans decreased 4% linked quarter. Given the improving outlook and strong performance of the portfolio, our reserves decreased, ending the quarter at 1.65% ex-PPP, compared with 1.75% at the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained stable at 10.3% at the end of the third quarter after returning $167 million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This is at the top of our listed capital priorities on the slide. We paused our stock repurchase program pending the investor shareholder vote scheduled for November 19. After the vote, we have the opportunity to resume repurchases with $655 million of capacity remaining under our current Board authorization. The estimated CET1 impacts of our pending acquisitions are on the slide, along with the targeted closing cap. Before I move on to our 4Q outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the Company on Slide 14. Our TOP 6 program is in its final stages. Everything is on track, and we will achieve our targeted results. We are preparing for the launch of a TOP 7 program with more details to follow later this year. These TOP programs have been critical in the funding of our strategic initiatives and in driving positive operating leverage, which are key to achieving our medium-term financial targets. On the ESG front, I'm very excited to say that we've launched a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to generate a positive and material impact by improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gases. An area of high focus for us has been moving more rapidly to digital channels, which we accelerated given the behavioral changes we've seen coming out of the pandemic. You can see some of the year-over-year sales on Slide 15. Digital book sales, for example, are up 24%. Mobile active users are up 20%, and the number of Zelle transactions are up 34%. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities. And by the end of this year, consumers will be able to perform about 3/4 of all transactions directly through the mobile app. And by the end of 2022, this will include nearly all transactions. This provides us with strong leverage to continue repositioning our branches towards an advice-based model. Moving to Slide 16. As part of our ongoing efforts to help customers better navigate their financial lives, we recently announced several initiatives designed to make banking more transparent and accessible, including a new way to avoid overdraft fees and a commitment to helping ensure that underserved communities have access to banking services. We introduced Citizens Peace of Mind, a new deposit feature providing customers with the ability to avoid the unnecessary overdraft fees. This feature will come with new capabilities to monitor and alert customers to overdraft withdrawals and a rate period to fund their account. The financial impact of our overdraft policy seems will be to forgo the return to historical over-drafting levels. You can expect 2022 service charges and fees to stabilize around 2021 year-to-date annualized levels. The benefits of these trend changes are shown on the right side of Slide 16. We expect higher satisfaction, lower attrition and lower operational costs to offset the foregone overdraft revenues over time. Lastly, we also announced a new commitment to serving under bank communities, including the introduction of a new checking account with no overdraft fees and features that will meet the bank on national account standards. These are designed to ensure that everyone has access to a transparent, easy-to-use, and affordable transactional account. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook on Slide 17. We expect NII to be broadly stable to down slightly, giving a lower benefit from PPP forgiveness due to the pull forward into the third quarter. NII is expected to be up around 2% in the fourth quarter ex-PPP impacts. Most importantly, we are well positioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with average loans up 1.5% to 2% or 2.5% to 3% ex-PPP and soft loan growth up around 3% or around 4% ex-PPP. We expect continued strength in retail across mortgage, education and auto. And in commercial, we expect to see growth led by subscription line financing, supporting deal-related activity and asset-backed lending. This loan growth positions us well for 2022 and helps offset the impact from PPP runoff. Fee income is expected to be broadly stable as a seasonal decline in mortgage as well as some expected pressure on margins given excess industry capacity is expected to be offset by some real strength in Capital Markets given exceptional pipelines. Noninterest expense is expected to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter, benefiting from our efficiency initiatives. And we expect net charge-offs will be broadly stable with the provision expense lower than net charge-offs. I should add that this guidance excludes the impact of the JMP acquisition, which we are targeting to close in the middle of the fourth quarter. To wrap up on Slide 18, this is a strong quarter for Citizens with good momentum heading into the end of the year. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: All right. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up to Q&A, please.\nOperator:  We'll go to our first question that will be from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Let's see. John, maybe I was hoping you could provide a little more color on what's going on with the swap book that you've been adding to. I was hoping specifically you could sort of talk about the balance between adding new swaps and maintaining your asset sensitivity, in particular. I guess what is your preferred sensitivity to higher rates? In other words, is there something that specifically that we're targeting? Or how should we be thinking about that?\nJohn Woods: Yes. Just kind of big picture here. I mean I think that we've, as I've mentioned, seen some good opportunities to start in this new sort of steepening cycle to start layering in swaps broadly. As I may have mentioned, our asset sensitivity is down to about 9.8% or so at the end of the third quarter. As we migrate across the entire tightening cycle that may come, we expect to try to migrate down to something that will be low single digits. And in order to get there, that would require not only the hedging that we've done to date, which would be about $12 billion in the third -- sorry, in 2021 through October, but would require in all likelihood, another $20 billion or so to get us to a low single-digit asset sensitivity when we get near the top of the tightening cycle. The other thing I'll also offer up is that the acquisitions of ISBC and HSBC will also add as sensitivity and that will require another $1.5 billion to $2 billion to offset. So big picture, our philosophy is to maintain good upside to short-term rates, which we have and the majority of our exposure is to short-term rates. And as we continue to see attractive opportunities, to monetize that asset sensitivity as the yield curve steepens, we'll continue to dollar cost average into that over time.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. I appreciate that. And then switching gears just a little, I was hoping you could talk about any differences in deposit growth trends that you're seeing between your retail and your commercial customers?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean I think we're seeing good uptake and maybe we'll go ahead and let Don and Brendan highlight. But in the third quarter, we had growth both in average and spot of 1%. And I think that was driven primarily by commercial in the quarter, but we're seeing strong deposit flows on both sides. We're still seeing positive growth on both consumer and commercial, and maybe I'll just offer it up to Don and Brendan to see if they want to add anything.\nDon McCree: I think that's right on the commercial side, we're still seeing a lot of deposit flow, notwithstanding the fact that we're trying to push pricing down. So we still have a little bit of surge deposits, but probably $1 billion or $2 billion, we see running off as we go into next year. So we think deposits continue to be strong well into '22.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, similar trends on the consumer side. The noninterest-bearing deposits have been very sticky despite consumer activity and spending picking up the deposits have been hanging around. And so they're still a bit elevated with the surge deposits, the second and third round stimulus generally were not spent. They were more saved or used to pay down debt, and we're seeing that with the balances hanging around the customers' pockets. On the interest-bearing side, we're seeing a rundown of CDs and it's generally replaced with low-cost deposits with basic savings and some low interest-bearing products like CDs. So that's allowing the cost of funds to continue to gear down, consumer cost of funds all in sub 6 basis points now. So we're kind of at basement levels and still seeing the deposits very, very sticky.\nJohn Woods: And one thing to hasten to add with the search deposits that we suspect most of that stays around and deposits stay relatively stable over time, given organic growth offsets any potential marginal runoff of some of the COVID-related deposits. So, that's a good sign.\nBruce Van Saun: The one last point to add, it's Bruce, would be the demand deposits now are about 32% of total deposits. So, that's been an effort where we've really focused on trying to raise that as a percentage of our total funding base. And we've had some good success on the consumer side in mass affluent and growing the commercial side. And so, we feel really good about where that sits.\nOperator: We'll go next to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.\nMatt O'Connor: I was wondering if you could talk a bit about loan pricing trends. And I guess, especially in commercial, where one of your peers yesterday talked about kind of continued pressure there as new loans have come on versus kind of what's rolling off on re-pricing?\nDon McCree: Yes. Why don't I take that, Matt, it's Don. We're -- it's holding up pretty well. It depends on the type of transaction, but we're seeing a little bit of deterioration, but not material. So you see it in our NIM, our NIM is holding up nicely. We're trying to stay disciplined. So where we see things -- we haven't changed our approach one bit. So we look at overall return on relationships of which loan spread is a piece of it. So we'll compromise a little bit on loan spread if we see other fee business attached to that loan. But if we don't see the fee business, we're not going to chase yield just to book a loan.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, similar discipline in consumer. I'd say there's some asset classes still are mildly elevated on what we would tend to see in this rate cycle like auto or the spreads are a little bit expanded. We've got front book, back book challenges given the state of the yield curve that our back book, the runoff is at a higher yield than what we're putting on. But front book returns are still very, very strong. I'd say there's one or two spots where we're seeing some intensity and competition on returns, particularly where there's fintechs involved, whether it's in point of sale or student lending in particular. But we're keeping our discipline and making sure we're priced to adequate returns to support driving up our ROTCE. And we feel good about able to get growth and make that balance, as you can see in our numbers.\nMatt O'Connor: And I guess, taken together, like as you think about growing loans, it sounds like you're confident that the volume is enough to offset any margin or pricing pressure going forward?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. On the consumer side, I do, I see us continuing to be able to sort of moderately accelerate our pace of loan growth. And keep in mind that our growth levels now when you think about the last question around elevated deposits in an environment where customers are also flushed with cash. So as that starts to draw down, we expect loan growth to pick up even more as consumers need more leverage where right now, they're sitting on a lot of cash. So we feel really good about the medium term for loan growth prospects.\nDon McCree: And then why don't I add to that on the commercial side, as John mentioned, the highlight numbers are strong, but we're seeing our pipelines on the loan side, not only on the capital markets but on the loan side, up 10%, 15% quarter-on-quarter and then another 10%, 15% as we go into the into the fourth quarter. We've got -- we're adding new clients that had a very good pace as we benefit from our expansion markets in particular, and we're growing our commitment book faster than our loan book. So, as utilization begins to pick up, it will be picking up off a larger commitment book. So that all feels reasonably good as we sit here today.\nOperator: We'll move next to the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead please.\nGerard Cassidy: John, can we come back to the swap portfolio. Can you share with us what interest rate environment you will benefit the most from with the book that you've put on, meaning, rising short-term rates by 100 basis points or long-term rates going up by 50 basis points. Can you kind of work through that? And then second, as part of that question, if you didn't put the swap book on, what would have the asset sensitivity been of your balance sheet today?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean I'll just hit that with a high level. We're more exposed to the short end the curve than the long end. So pretty -- the asset, it's about 60-40 short to long and rising, frankly as we migrate through the cycle. So, the environment that will work well for us is when the Fed lift-off begins. That's an environment that will really drive net interest margins and NII upward given the un-hedged portion of our C&I book and other floating rate exposures that we have. So that still remains our most favorable sort of environment that would work well for us. And did you just give you a sense for how the math plays out on that, a 25 basis point rise on the short end drives about $80 million or so of NII for us. So that helps you kind of quantify what were -- where the benefit comes from. In terms of asset sensitivity, we would be in the low to mid-teens without continuing to hedge. And it's not really where our risk appetite is. There's rates can go up, and we hope they do continue to go up, but they can go down as well. And so there's a risk profile there that, over time, we're not only attempting to kind of preserve our asset sensitivity, but we're also cognizant of that there is downside exposure that we're taking off the table when we dollar cost average and with the swap out.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then as a follow-up, John, you gave us some good data on Slide 15 on your digital metrics. I was curious, when you look at your mobile active users, what percentage of the households are mobile active users? And then second, when you look at your digital book sales, great growth year-over-year, what percentage of your sales are now coming through that digital channel?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Great question. It's Brendan. We look at a lot of different metrics on digital. I'd say, when we have the customers' primary relationship, the digital active users are incredibly high. It's over 80% of our customer base is digitally engaged. So, we feel good about that foundation. Our efforts now are moving from just general active to full-service transactional banking done in a much more everyday way on mobile. So we've got a lot of efforts underway across the Company, which are driving these metrics up, including in the branches and the call center efforts communicate and nudge our customers to get more engaged with digital. It's hugely retentive for us with our customers, but also, as you know, if we can get them really engaged, we can pivot the branches more to advice and there's a cost dynamic here at play that we can then go back and reinvest in the top of the funnel for customer acquisition growth. So, we feel really good about the trends in mobile and I see a lot of upside here looking forward.\nBruce Van Saun: Percentage of digital sales.\nBrendan Coughlin: Sorry, percentage of digital sales. Yes, it's rapidly growing, and it's a very different category by category. Some of our lending businesses are principally digital first, and you'll see in things like student a 75% to 80% rate of digital, whereas something like DDA and deposits, it's more in the 25% to 30% range, but growing two years ago, it was in the 15% range. So, we're seeing active upticks. The branch channel for basic deposit products is still the largest source of customer acquisition, but there's some value coming into play.\nOperator: For our next question, we'll go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead please.\nKen Usdin: John, on the other side of the rate sensitivity, you had previously talked about wanting to keep the securities book around mid-teens of earning assets, and I see that you've added some securities at period end versus average. Given what we're seeing in the environment, what's your appetite for continuing to move some of that excess cash into the book? And any changed thoughts vis-\u00e0-vis what you've already talked about on swaps in terms of what you want to do and where you want the securities book to go?\nJohn Woods: Yes. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think that you may see the securities book rise, but as it relates to a percentage of total interest-earning assets, we're still in that mode of around mid-teens or thereabouts. It could tick up a little bit, but there's not really any plans for a large change in the percentage of securities to interest-earning assets. And I think the reason for that is twofold. One is that given our loan growth opportunities, really, that's our preference is that we would prefer to deploy our excess liquidity into our loan opportunities, which from a -- when you look at our consumer lending, which is the diversity of that and seeing commercial starting to really lift off a bit, that's where we want to put that cash. And so that's what the plan would be in the near term for that to head in that direction. I think the other aspect of it is that we just have a view that the rate risk hedging, with the securities books can also double duty on. We think it's a bit more efficient to do that off balance sheet with swaps. And so that's still the plan is to dollar cost average over time in that space.\nKen Usdin: Got it. And John, on NII, in the slide deck, you talked about PPP being a 7 basis point increase sequentially. Can you just level set us on how much PPP was in the NII? And just what you expect to trail that out as the program runs down?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, big picture you've got -- I mean, I think the way I would talk about that is that all throughout the year, we've had a sense that PPP was going to be about the same first half and second half, and that's playing out. But there has been a $15 million increase in the third quarter versus the second quarter in PPP contribution to NII. That $15 million really is coming from the fourth quarter. So really, that's really the -- how it's all going to play out is that $15 million increase in PPP from 2Q to 3Q and then because of the pull forward from 4Q, a $30 million decrease from 3Q to 4Q on PPP. But I would hasten to add that ex-PPP in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're seeing NII growth ex-PPP, and that's really good to see. And I think we mentioned that we're up about 2% in terms of 4Q NII ex-PPP. So a lot of that PPP downdraft is getting offset given the fact that our guide is really stable to down only slightly.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add -- Ken, I would just add that this has been an issue of great interest for analysts and investors like what's been the impact of PPP. We always view it as something that was transitory that eventually these were nice earning asset for us for 2021, but they would very quickly start to reduce, and then they would fall off and not have much of an impact on '22. So the real was can we develop enough loan growth to basically substitute core consumer loans, in particular, for the PPP loans that are running off. And we think with the soft loan growth we had in Q3 and what we're expecting in Q4, mission accomplished that we'll be in good position to offset any future impacts as it relates to the first half and all of '22.\nKen Usdin: Absolutely. And just one quick one in. How much, John and Bruce is still running off from the other retail, because that -- I know you have the Citizens Pay presumably growing in there, but what's weighing against that?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. What's weighing against that is the personal unsecured portfolio that we've ran up about two years ago and then decided it's best when the COVID era hit to run that back down and stop new originations. So that's been a little bit of a deadweight in the unsecured area which masks a little bit the nice growth we've had in Citizens Pay and some of the rebounding that we're seeing in card. Brendan, you may have the exact numbers. So what's left of that at this point.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. It's about a little shy of $900 million left on the personal loan book, and it's about $150 million-ish of a drag quarter-on-quarter to loan growth is one of the other book fits and rundown mode for us is marine RV as well that's all over years Longer duration that have been built in our run rate. The biggest drag is really the personal book. So $900 million or so.\nOperator: We will go next to John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Go ahead please.\nJohn Pancari: Also on the loan front, I know on the line utilization, you indicated the 50 bps increase in the gradual recovery expected. Can you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on the areas of expected strength as you see that rebound in line utilization taking hold? I know you mentioned the subscription finance, M&A and ABL, is that the areas where you continue to expect that momentum to build? Or do you expect that to broaden, and if you could comment on what areas?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Don will elaborate on that. I mean I think the areas that we're seeing looking forward into commercial is, we've seen strength in asset-backed securitizations that will -- we see that continuing. Subscription line finance, as I mentioned in my remarks, in part due to M&A activity is an area of continued growth. CRE is a place where we're seeing some good uptake maybe in the office space with and in the industrial space as well. So that's starting to contribute now as well. And then to your point about C&I utilization, I mean, I think two points related to it, so we're seeing commitments rising. And even if utilization doesn't really lift off, that still provides some loan growth even if utilization levels are up just a very tiny bit if overall commitments are up, and the next still creates a positive contribution. And there's a handful of sectors that are driving that. You've got construction, energy, manufacturing or a couple of the areas. And it is somewhat broad-based. It's a small increase, but somewhat broad-based number of sectors where we're seeing small increases in utilization and maybe just turn it over to Don for any...\nDon McCree: I think you kind of covered. I think the good news, John, is that we are seeing in our core middle market and C&I book, the beginnings of a little bit of daylight in terms of utilization. As John said in the opening remarks, clearly, the supply chain and the labor issue is restraining the performance of some companies. So, they're going to -- they would be performing better than they even are now if didn't have some of their supply chain problems. But we -- in the last couple of months, we're beginning to see some core C&I utilization. The financial capital markets oriented, which is where subscription lines and ABS and the stuff sits up have been really strong all year, and we expect them to continue to be strong as we get into the fourth quarter into next year. So kind of a combination of would see...\nBruce Van Saun: Probably also -- you hit on the point, the middle market is where you're seeing that take-up on line utilization for bigger companies...\nJohn Woods: Companies that don't have access to capital markets. So the challenge that we've had on loan growth is predominantly pay downs because people are going to the capital market given the strength of the capital markets. So the middle market cash are beginning to see some light at the end of the table. And part of it is just CEO confidence, frankly. They really, really, really squeezed down on their companies. And as they begin to see COVID really begin to wane, they're beginning to grow their companies a little bit quicker at the margin.\nJohn Pancari: Yes. Good. Got it. Okay. And then separately, on the capital markets business, I know you mentioned a few times, a very, very solid deal pipeline there. Can you maybe talk to us about how you're thinking about that that line when you look at 2022 as you're budgeting? And then also, can you remind us how much we should assume that falls to the bottom line in that business, particularly as the top line momentum really builds?\nDon McCree: I think we continue to get more and more optimistic about '22. I was sitting here maybe midyear saying, wow, '21 is really a banner year. There's a lot of this that may be keying off potential tax changes, both on the M&A side and on the capital markets side. But our pipelines continue to build, and we think it's going to be very strong as we go into next year. I think my general view is you've got an environment where you're going to have a relatively strong economy, you're going to have relatively low interest rates, and you're going to have very high liquidity, and that's a very, very strong backdrop for '22. One of the things that we've got our eye on, we just don't know yet is how much is going to get pulled into '21. So we're going to have to be rebuilding pipelines maybe in the first quarter to get going. So you may see a fourth quarter, first quarter kind of upswing, but we'll have to wait until the balance of the year to see that. And I don't really -- I'd say -- I don't know what the marginal contribution is. It's actually lower than the lending business because the comp payouts are higher, but I don't have that number at the tip of my fingers. And remember, we pay a lot of different people. We pay bankers. We pay corporate finance people. We pay M&A people. We pay capital markets people, so it all blends together. And the way I look at it is our overall efficiency ratio is actually pretty good, and we're...\nBruce Van Saun: 40%.\nDon McCree: Yes. So with a 40% efficiency ratio, it washes out to the bottom line.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add, too, that we see these secular trends. We see private equity pools of capital growing and looking to put money to work an opportunity to gain some very attractive leverage levels and financing costs are low. So those trends will continue. And one of the reasons why we're hell-bent on assembling broader capabilities, including what we've done with some of the M&A boutique acquisitions in JMP, we want to be an intermediary in those flows of putting money to work. And if our middle market companies want to sell themselves, we can take them to market and get a good price. So, we've got the customer base. We increasingly have the product capabilities. And so that's reason for optimism in on of itself. I think we'll continue to gain a lot of synergies as we look out into '22.\nDon McCree: Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Bruce, is with JMP coming on board, it's the last piece of the puzzle, really. So not only do we have full service capabilities to help our clients do whatever they need to do. We've got a nice diversity in terms of product sets. So, it will let us kind of benefit and benefit when markets are good and the equities or the debt markets and vice versa.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes.\nOperator:  We'll go next to Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim, we seem to have lost your line, if you took yourself out of your queue. There we go, one moment. Your line is open. Go ahead please.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, I think as we look through the deal closings, one, I guess, we're still on track for 1Q closing for HSBC assets, any risk of a delay there? And remind us, as you close those transactions. Are there any aspects of those balance sheets where we could see any runoff that may impact results as we look pro forma for the deal?\nJohn Woods: I'll go ahead and start. Ebrahim, it's John. So, the expectation the expectation for HSBC is to close mid first quarter, and that's very much on track. We're deep into the sort of preparations for that. It's both a close and a conversion on a...\nBruce Van Saun: And you have the regulatory approval\nJohn Woods: And we have the -- exactly. We have regulatory approvals in hand on that transaction. So that one is looking just exactly as we expected. And I think the other larger transaction, which was -- when you look at the overall one big strategic allocation of capital, but ISBC is a separate legal entity that we've got the shareholder vote scheduled for November 19, and the regulatory approvals are pending on that. The expectation and target for that is that we receive those approvals in sometime in early '22, and we have an opportunity to close that in 2Q. But nevertheless, that's pending, and we'll keep monitoring it. As it relates to runoff, we're not expecting to have runoff. But I think the way we've described it is that we would continue those businesses, but the front book sort of activities would have a different profile than the back book, in particular, with investors because of all the capabilities that we're bringing to the table. And so, we're not expecting to have us have any meaningful runoff, but we are expecting the loan book to have a different profile, a year or two down the line, given more C&I and more consumer lending that we'll be able to generate off that platform as you look ahead.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add a couple of points there, John. First off, on HSBC, the price is tied to what comes over. So if there is any runoff, we would have a shock absorber there in terms of what the ultimate premium is that we pay. And secondly, just when it comes to JMP, we're working very diligently to try to get that closed mid-fourth quarter here. So we should have four to six weeks, say, in the results here in Q4, which would be accretive, of course.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That's helpful. And just one separate question. You all spend a lot of time on the payments with Citizen Pay, what you're doing in buy now pay later. When you think about Zelle and you put a stat about 34% growth in Zelle, is there more that you think? And I understand you don't call the shots in Zelle, do you think Zelle should be doing more in terms of enabling banks such as yourself to compete with some of the tech players in the business in terms of in-store payments, et cetera?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, it's Brendan. Look, I think Zelle, the rails that have been built for Zelle are adequate. And I think the industry including Citizens needs to kind of take control of the UI layer that sits above the rails and innovate on our own around the customer experience, whether it's pure payments, that's facilitated with Zelle or whether it's purchasing something direct with the merchant, which would be more a Citizens Pay platform. So, we're making big investments in both of those environments so you can see a world where those capabilities converge a little bit. And it's a similar experience, whether you're buying something from a merchant or whether you're sending money to a friend, I think that's possible. But I think the rails are adequate. I don't necessarily think Zelle in particular, needs do anything dramatic to innovate. I think it's more around what we can do in the UI layer to make things easier for customers to increase engagement as you can see our numbers, that's happening. And we continue to want to scale that up further and get more customers deeper engaged.\nBruce Van Saun: It's just focusing on the use cases and where we can differentiate ourselves. And so we've got essential effort enterprise payments capability that's really coordinating between commercial and consumer to drive our decision-making there and make sure that we're investing in things that will really drive future growth.\nOperator: And for our next question, we will go to the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead please.\nVivek Juneja: Just a clarification. The PPP since you've not given numbers and maybe that might make it easier and -- but if I look at the 7 basis points, that seems to equate to about $30 million in terms of the change from 2Q to 3Q. I heard you mentioned 15. So I'm trying to understand what am I missing there when we do that? I mean as I said, is it easier to just give the numbers what it was 2Q and 3Q?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, we did give the numbers that it is a 15 delta. And the reason that it shows a 7 basis points on that is there's a numerator effect and the denominator effect, Vivek. So you have loans running off, which affects the denominator. So it really doubles the impact. You probably have about 3 basis points from the NII pickup and then you get three to four for having the loan balances run down and be forgiven.\nVivek Juneja: Got it. That's helpful, Bruce. In the roll-on roll-off on the securities yields, are you -- how is that going? Can you give us some color where that stands and how much further?\nJohn Woods: Yes, sure. I mean, so we've had several quarters. It's gone back for a while now with securities yields falling. And I think the dynamic there has been not only the pure front book, back book, which has been negative by about 40 basis points or so. But also you've got a premium amortization, which has been a drag. And I think our outlook, however, for is that to stabilize and frankly, start to turn around in the fourth quarter. I think in large degree, we will see the front -- the pure front book, back book start to narrow, call it, it'll fall to something in the neighborhood of 30 basis points. But at the same time, we're also seeing as rates rise, premium amortization will also slow and that will provide some the -- a net positive to securities yields in 4Q.\nBruce Van Saun: So yes, it's really -- we're at about an inflection point there, Vivek. So with that steeper curve, as John indicated, front book, back book when you factor in reduced amortization, we're now going to see that turn to be a tailwind from being a headwind for the first three quarters of the year.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. If I may, one more. The other retail, you've been talking about Citizens Pay, you've signed up a lot of partners, hard to see, although because it's overcast by the runoff portfolio. What are you seeing in those loans in terms of growth the Citizens Pay related? Is there some numbers that you can give us because obviously, the combined number doesn't look so great, but I recognize it's muddied?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. The growth in Citizens stay has been pretty substantial. So all things kind of buy now pay later is up around 40% year-over-year with balances, and we continue to see that accelerate. We've had a lot of activity in the back half of this year on bringing on new clients, and it takes a while for these things to ramp. They've got -- we pilot them, they come online, we work with merchants to bring them to life to market them to their customers. So it's a bit of a ramp-up period. And so, all the leading activities that need to happen to continue to have confidence that this can scale through 2022 and beyond are there. So, we feel pretty good that it's headed in the right direction. We're building a lot of new technical capabilities that's broadening out our value proposition within Citizens Pay as well. So, underlying very, very good, healthy growth.\nBruce Van Saun: It sounds like Kristin, that we could probably shed some light and be a little more transparent in that whole unsecured area for future presentation at a conference or in our general releases. Thanks for the question. Yes.\nOperator:  There are no further questions in queue. With that, I'll turn it over back to Mr. Bruce Van Saun. Please go ahead.\nBruce Van Saun: All right. Thank you very much. So thanks, folks, for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Everybody, stay well. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $546 million and EPS of $1.22. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.2%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 3% linked quarter, given growth in both fee income and net interest income. Period-end loans were up 1% in the quarter with strong originations in retail and commercial. Loans were up 2%, excluding PPP forgiveness, giving us good momentum heading into the fourth quarter. Key highlights include strong results in Capital Markets, notwithstanding seasonality, another strong quarter for Wealth and a rebound in Mortgage fees, and we delivered positive sequential operating leverage of over 2% this quarter with well-controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $33 million, which reflects strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.65% excluding PPP loans. We are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $167 million to shareholders and dividends during the quarter. And finally, we continue to grow our tangible book value per share which was $34.44 at quarter end, up 7% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the third quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2% linked quarter given interest-earning asset growth, stable net interest margin and higher day count. The net interest margin was 2.72%, flat sequentially as the benefit of accelerated PPP forgiveness and improved funding costs were offset by the impact of higher cash balances as well as lower earning asset yields given low rates. One highlight is our continued progress on lowering interest-bearing deposit costs, which were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points. Our asset sensitivity decreased to about 9.8% from 10.7% at the end of the second quarter. The decrease primarily reflects loan and deposit exchanges and the addition of $2.5 billion in received fixed spots in the quarter. We saw good entry points for the swaps given some steepening in the yield curve. So far in the fourth quarter, we have added another $1.25 billion. The hedging actions we've executed to-date in 2021 are one of the levers we are pulling to address headwinds from swap runoff and other impacts of the low rate environment. We expect to continue adding to receive fixed swap portfolio and further moderate our asset sensitivity as the curve steepens while maintaining meaningful upside benefit to higher short-term rates. Referring to Slide 7. We delivered solid fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee income with strong results in Capital Markets and Wealth. Mortgage fees rebounded in the quarter, up $23 million as production fees benefited from lower agency fees, and we saw improvement in MSR hedge results. Diving further into this performance, production revenue was up $12 million linked quarter, benefiting from a modest improvement in gain on sale margins across channels, given improved agency pricing and favorable execution. This was partially offset by a decline in adjusted lock volume, down sequentially about 10%, which is broadly in line with industry level trends. As expected, we continue to see a shift towards purchase originations, which increased from about 48% of the total in second quarter to about 54% in the third quarter. The contribution from servicing operations decreased $4 million linked quarter, reflecting higher MSR amortization. Our third-party servicing book grew to $87 billion, up 3% linked quarter and 8% year-over-year. Lastly, our MSR hedging results improved $15 million linked quarter given an unusually large negative result in Q2. Capital Markets were down a bit from record levels, reflecting seasonality, particularly in syndication fees. However, M&A advisory fees were higher and our pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is exceptionally strong. Wealth fees were up slightly, continuing to build on record levels, reflecting an increase in assets under management from net inflows. Moving on to other positive fee contributors. We saw improvements in service charges and fees and card fees, which benefited from the strengthening economy as debit transactions and credit card spend, continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter as good expense discipline and the benefit of efficiency initiatives largely offset higher operational and travel costs. Period-end loans on Slide 9 were up 1% linked quarter or 2% excluding PPP. Retail loans are growing, up 3% and commercial loans were up 1%, excluding PPP in a tough operating environment. Average loans were down 1%, but still up 1%, excluding PPP. Diving into drivers a bit more. The diversity of our retail lending business produced another quarter of record origination though we continue to see high payouts. Strength was noteworthy in mortgage, auto and education. Commercial has seen strong underlying activity with spot loans up 1% in the quarter, excluding PPP. We had a very robust origination quarter led by commercial real estate, asset-backed lending and subscription line financing supporting deal-related activity. This was largely offset by continued elevated payoff activity, which in part reflects favorable conditions for commercial companies to access the debt capital markets. Line utilization levels were up around 50 basis points still near historic lows. We foresee a gradual recovery in coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investments such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages resolve themselves. In addition, our period-end commitments are up around 2%, which will benefit us down the road once investment picks up. Overall soft loan growth of 2% for the quarter ex-PPP provides good underlying momentum for loan growth in the fourth quarter. On Slide 10, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 7% year-over-year with strong demand in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the decline in term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and low-cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit re-pricing, with total deposit costs down 2 basis points to 9 basis points. Interest-bearing deposit costs were down 2 basis points to 14 basis points during the quarter with opportunity to reduce further. Moving on to credit on Slide 11 and 12, we saw excellent credit results this quarter. Net charge-offs dropped from 25 basis points to 14 basis points for the third quarter, driven by improvements across the portfolio. Nonaccrual loans decreased 4% linked quarter. Given the improving outlook and strong performance of the portfolio, our reserves decreased, ending the quarter at 1.65% ex-PPP, compared with 1.75% at the end of the second quarter. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained stable at 10.3% at the end of the third quarter after returning $167 million in capital to shareholders through dividends in the quarter. This is at the top of our listed capital priorities on the slide. We paused our stock repurchase program pending the investor shareholder vote scheduled for November 19. After the vote, we have the opportunity to resume repurchases with $655 million of capacity remaining under our current Board authorization. The estimated CET1 impacts of our pending acquisitions are on the slide, along with the targeted closing cap. Before I move on to our 4Q outlook, let me highlight some exciting things that are happening across the Company on Slide 14. Our TOP 6 program is in its final stages. Everything is on track, and we will achieve our targeted results. We are preparing for the launch of a TOP 7 program with more details to follow later this year. These TOP programs have been critical in the funding of our strategic initiatives and in driving positive operating leverage, which are key to achieving our medium-term financial targets. On the ESG front, I'm very excited to say that we've launched a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to generate a positive and material impact by improving energy efficiency, promoting sustainability and reducing greenhouse gases. An area of high focus for us has been moving more rapidly to digital channels, which we accelerated given the behavioral changes we've seen coming out of the pandemic. You can see some of the year-over-year sales on Slide 15. Digital book sales, for example, are up 24%. Mobile active users are up 20%, and the number of Zelle transactions are up 34%. We continue to enhance our digital capabilities. And by the end of this year, consumers will be able to perform about 3/4 of all transactions directly through the mobile app. And by the end of 2022, this will include nearly all transactions. This provides us with strong leverage to continue repositioning our branches towards an advice-based model. Moving to Slide 16. As part of our ongoing efforts to help customers better navigate their financial lives, we recently announced several initiatives designed to make banking more transparent and accessible, including a new way to avoid overdraft fees and a commitment to helping ensure that underserved communities have access to banking services. We introduced Citizens Peace of Mind, a new deposit feature providing customers with the ability to avoid the unnecessary overdraft fees. This feature will come with new capabilities to monitor and alert customers to overdraft withdrawals and a rate period to fund their account. The financial impact of our overdraft policy seems will be to forgo the return to historical over-drafting levels. You can expect 2022 service charges and fees to stabilize around 2021 year-to-date annualized levels. The benefits of these trend changes are shown on the right side of Slide 16. We expect higher satisfaction, lower attrition and lower operational costs to offset the foregone overdraft revenues over time. Lastly, we also announced a new commitment to serving under bank communities, including the introduction of a new checking account with no overdraft fees and features that will meet the bank on national account standards. These are designed to ensure that everyone has access to a transparent, easy-to-use, and affordable transactional account. And now for some high-level commentary on the outlook on Slide 17. We expect NII to be broadly stable to down slightly, giving a lower benefit from PPP forgiveness due to the pull forward into the third quarter. NII is expected to be up around 2% in the fourth quarter ex-PPP impacts. Most importantly, we are well positioned to see overall loan growth accelerate in the fourth quarter with average loans up 1.5% to 2% or 2.5% to 3% ex-PPP and soft loan growth up around 3% or around 4% ex-PPP. We expect continued strength in retail across mortgage, education and auto. And in commercial, we expect to see growth led by subscription line financing, supporting deal-related activity and asset-backed lending. This loan growth positions us well for 2022 and helps offset the impact from PPP runoff. Fee income is expected to be broadly stable as a seasonal decline in mortgage as well as some expected pressure on margins given excess industry capacity is expected to be offset by some real strength in Capital Markets given exceptional pipelines. Noninterest expense is expected to be broadly stable in the fourth quarter, benefiting from our efficiency initiatives. And we expect net charge-offs will be broadly stable with the provision expense lower than net charge-offs. I should add that this guidance excludes the impact of the JMP acquisition, which we are targeting to close in the middle of the fourth quarter. To wrap up on Slide 18, this is a strong quarter for Citizens with good momentum heading into the end of the year. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Yes. Just kind of big picture here. I mean I think that we've, as I've mentioned, seen some good opportunities to start in this new sort of steepening cycle to start layering in swaps broadly. As I may have mentioned, our asset sensitivity is down to about 9.8% or so at the end of the third quarter. As we migrate across the entire tightening cycle that may come, we expect to try to migrate down to something that will be low single digits. And in order to get there, that would require not only the hedging that we've done to date, which would be about $12 billion in the third -- sorry, in 2021 through October, but would require in all likelihood, another $20 billion or so to get us to a low single-digit asset sensitivity when we get near the top of the tightening cycle. The other thing I'll also offer up is that the acquisitions of ISBC and HSBC will also add as sensitivity and that will require another $1.5 billion to $2 billion to offset. So big picture, our philosophy is to maintain good upside to short-term rates, which we have and the majority of our exposure is to short-term rates. And as we continue to see attractive opportunities, to monetize that asset sensitivity as the yield curve steepens, we'll continue to dollar cost average into that over time. Yes. I mean I think we're seeing good uptake and maybe we'll go ahead and let Don and Brendan highlight. But in the third quarter, we had growth both in average and spot of 1%. And I think that was driven primarily by commercial in the quarter, but we're seeing strong deposit flows on both sides. We're still seeing positive growth on both consumer and commercial, and maybe I'll just offer it up to Don and Brendan to see if they want to add anything. And one thing to hasten to add with the search deposits that we suspect most of that stays around and deposits stay relatively stable over time, given organic growth offsets any potential marginal runoff of some of the COVID-related deposits. So, that's a good sign. Yes. I mean I'll just hit that with a high level. We're more exposed to the short end the curve than the long end. So pretty -- the asset, it's about 60-40 short to long and rising, frankly as we migrate through the cycle. So, the environment that will work well for us is when the Fed lift-off begins. That's an environment that will really drive net interest margins and NII upward given the un-hedged portion of our C&I book and other floating rate exposures that we have. So that still remains our most favorable sort of environment that would work well for us. And did you just give you a sense for how the math plays out on that, a 25 basis point rise on the short end drives about $80 million or so of NII for us. So that helps you kind of quantify what were -- where the benefit comes from. In terms of asset sensitivity, we would be in the low to mid-teens without continuing to hedge. And it's not really where our risk appetite is. There's rates can go up, and we hope they do continue to go up, but they can go down as well. And so there's a risk profile there that, over time, we're not only attempting to kind of preserve our asset sensitivity, but we're also cognizant of that there is downside exposure that we're taking off the table when we dollar cost average and with the swap out. Yes. Yes, I appreciate the question. I think that you may see the securities book rise, but as it relates to a percentage of total interest-earning assets, we're still in that mode of around mid-teens or thereabouts. It could tick up a little bit, but there's not really any plans for a large change in the percentage of securities to interest-earning assets. And I think the reason for that is twofold. One is that given our loan growth opportunities, really, that's our preference is that we would prefer to deploy our excess liquidity into our loan opportunities, which from a -- when you look at our consumer lending, which is the diversity of that and seeing commercial starting to really lift off a bit, that's where we want to put that cash. And so that's what the plan would be in the near term for that to head in that direction. I think the other aspect of it is that we just have a view that the rate risk hedging, with the securities books can also double duty on. We think it's a bit more efficient to do that off balance sheet with swaps. And so that's still the plan is to dollar cost average over time in that space. Yes. I mean, big picture you've got -- I mean, I think the way I would talk about that is that all throughout the year, we've had a sense that PPP was going to be about the same first half and second half, and that's playing out. But there has been a $15 million increase in the third quarter versus the second quarter in PPP contribution to NII. That $15 million really is coming from the fourth quarter. So really, that's really the -- how it's all going to play out is that $15 million increase in PPP from 2Q to 3Q and then because of the pull forward from 4Q, a $30 million decrease from 3Q to 4Q on PPP. But I would hasten to add that ex-PPP in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we're seeing NII growth ex-PPP, and that's really good to see. And I think we mentioned that we're up about 2% in terms of 4Q NII ex-PPP. So a lot of that PPP downdraft is getting offset given the fact that our guide is really stable to down only slightly. Yes. I'll make a few comments, and Don will elaborate on that. I mean I think the areas that we're seeing looking forward into commercial is, we've seen strength in asset-backed securitizations that will -- we see that continuing. Subscription line finance, as I mentioned in my remarks, in part due to M&A activity is an area of continued growth. CRE is a place where we're seeing some good uptake maybe in the office space with and in the industrial space as well. So that's starting to contribute now as well. And then to your point about C&I utilization, I mean, I think two points related to it, so we're seeing commitments rising. And even if utilization doesn't really lift off, that still provides some loan growth even if utilization levels are up just a very tiny bit if overall commitments are up, and the next still creates a positive contribution. And there's a handful of sectors that are driving that. You've got construction, energy, manufacturing or a couple of the areas. And it is somewhat broad-based. It's a small increase, but somewhat broad-based number of sectors where we're seeing small increases in utilization and maybe just turn it over to Don for any... Companies that don't have access to capital markets. So the challenge that we've had on loan growth is predominantly pay downs because people are going to the capital market given the strength of the capital markets. So the middle market cash are beginning to see some light at the end of the table. And part of it is just CEO confidence, frankly. They really, really, really squeezed down on their companies. And as they begin to see COVID really begin to wane, they're beginning to grow their companies a little bit quicker at the margin. I'll go ahead and start. Ebrahim, it's John. So, the expectation the expectation for HSBC is to close mid first quarter, and that's very much on track. We're deep into the sort of preparations for that. It's both a close and a conversion on a... And we have the -- exactly. We have regulatory approvals in hand on that transaction. So that one is looking just exactly as we expected. And I think the other larger transaction, which was -- when you look at the overall one big strategic allocation of capital, but ISBC is a separate legal entity that we've got the shareholder vote scheduled for November 19, and the regulatory approvals are pending on that. The expectation and target for that is that we receive those approvals in sometime in early '22, and we have an opportunity to close that in 2Q. But nevertheless, that's pending, and we'll keep monitoring it. As it relates to runoff, we're not expecting to have runoff. But I think the way we've described it is that we would continue those businesses, but the front book sort of activities would have a different profile than the back book, in particular, with investors because of all the capabilities that we're bringing to the table. And so, we're not expecting to have us have any meaningful runoff, but we are expecting the loan book to have a different profile, a year or two down the line, given more C&I and more consumer lending that we'll be able to generate off that platform as you look ahead. Yes, sure. I mean, so we've had several quarters. It's gone back for a while now with securities yields falling. And I think the dynamic there has been not only the pure front book, back book, which has been negative by about 40 basis points or so. But also you've got a premium amortization, which has been a drag. And I think our outlook, however, for is that to stabilize and frankly, start to turn around in the fourth quarter. I think in large degree, we will see the front -- the pure front book, back book start to narrow, call it, it'll fall to something in the neighborhood of 30 basis points. But at the same time, we're also seeing as rates rise, premium amortization will also slow and that will provide some the -- a net positive to securities yields in 4Q."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "I think that's right on the commercial side, we're still seeing a lot of deposit flow, notwithstanding the fact that we're trying to push pricing down. So we still have a little bit of surge deposits, but probably $1 billion or $2 billion, we see running off as we go into next year. So we think deposits continue to be strong well into '22. Yes. Why don't I take that, Matt, it's Don. We're -- it's holding up pretty well. It depends on the type of transaction, but we're seeing a little bit of deterioration, but not material. So you see it in our NIM, our NIM is holding up nicely. We're trying to stay disciplined. So where we see things -- we haven't changed our approach one bit. So we look at overall return on relationships of which loan spread is a piece of it. So we'll compromise a little bit on loan spread if we see other fee business attached to that loan. But if we don't see the fee business, we're not going to chase yield just to book a loan. And then why don't I add to that on the commercial side, as John mentioned, the highlight numbers are strong, but we're seeing our pipelines on the loan side, not only on the capital markets but on the loan side, up 10%, 15% quarter-on-quarter and then another 10%, 15% as we go into the into the fourth quarter. We've got -- we're adding new clients that had a very good pace as we benefit from our expansion markets in particular, and we're growing our commitment book faster than our loan book. So, as utilization begins to pick up, it will be picking up off a larger commitment book. So that all feels reasonably good as we sit here today. I think you kind of covered. I think the good news, John, is that we are seeing in our core middle market and C&I book, the beginnings of a little bit of daylight in terms of utilization. As John said in the opening remarks, clearly, the supply chain and the labor issue is restraining the performance of some companies. So, they're going to -- they would be performing better than they even are now if didn't have some of their supply chain problems. But we -- in the last couple of months, we're beginning to see some core C&I utilization. The financial capital markets oriented, which is where subscription lines and ABS and the stuff sits up have been really strong all year, and we expect them to continue to be strong as we get into the fourth quarter into next year. So kind of a combination of would see... I think we continue to get more and more optimistic about '22. I was sitting here maybe midyear saying, wow, '21 is really a banner year. There's a lot of this that may be keying off potential tax changes, both on the M&A side and on the capital markets side. But our pipelines continue to build, and we think it's going to be very strong as we go into next year. I think my general view is you've got an environment where you're going to have a relatively strong economy, you're going to have relatively low interest rates, and you're going to have very high liquidity, and that's a very, very strong backdrop for '22. One of the things that we've got our eye on, we just don't know yet is how much is going to get pulled into '21. So we're going to have to be rebuilding pipelines maybe in the first quarter to get going. So you may see a fourth quarter, first quarter kind of upswing, but we'll have to wait until the balance of the year to see that. And I don't really -- I'd say -- I don't know what the marginal contribution is. It's actually lower than the lending business because the comp payouts are higher, but I don't have that number at the tip of my fingers. And remember, we pay a lot of different people. We pay bankers. We pay corporate finance people. We pay M&A people. We pay capital markets people, so it all blends together. And the way I look at it is our overall efficiency ratio is actually pretty good, and we're... Yes. So with a 40% efficiency ratio, it washes out to the bottom line. Yes. And the only thing I'd add to that, Bruce, is with JMP coming on board, it's the last piece of the puzzle, really. So not only do we have full service capabilities to help our clients do whatever they need to do. We've got a nice diversity in terms of product sets. So, it will let us kind of benefit and benefit when markets are good and the equities or the debt markets and vice versa."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We had a successful and busy third quarter, featuring continued strong execution of our strategic initiatives, good financial performance with positive operating leverage and 7% sequential PPNR growth and the announcement of three acquisitions. By playing offense, and we feel that we are taking the steps to position us for solid growth in franchise value, in earnings and in returns. Our financial performance in Q3 reflects strong revenue growth of 3% sequentially as both net interest income and fees grew nicely. NII benefited from a pickup in soft loan growth with retail up 3% and commercial up 1%, excluding PPP impact from loan forgiveness. The gradual improvement in loan volumes we have expected is materializing though held back a modest amount in Q3 by impacts from the Delta variant on the recovery as well as by supply chain issues and labor shortages. These impacts should continue to abate going forward, and we expect even faster loan growth in Q4. Interestingly, the amount of PPP forgiveness is roughly equivalent in the first and second halves of 2021, though Q3 saw a meaningful pull forward, which benefits Q3 at the expense of Q4. Nonetheless, the faster loan growth we expect in Q4 should largely offset the lower PPP impact on Q4 net interest income. Strong sequential fee growth once again demonstrated the diversity of our business model. Mortgage had a bounce-back quarter, which helped offset some seasonality in capital market fees, while Wealth hit a new record and consumer fees continued their recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. We expect this diversification to play out again in Q4 with Capital Markets poised for a strong quarter, given exceptional pipelines and Mortgage set for a seasonally softer quarter. We kept expenses under control given our efficiency initiatives, which led to positive sequential operating leverage of around 2.5%. And credit continues to be in great shape, with NCOs of 14 basis points in the quarter, well below our guidance range for the quarter of 20 to 25 basis points. These strong results across expenses and credit should continue into Q4. The strategic initiatives we're focused on across consumer and commercial continue to go well, and there's more on that in the presentation. We feel we are focused on prioritizing the areas where we can differentiate ourselves and where we have a right to win. The acquisitions we've announced year-to-date are all attractive from a strategic and financial standpoint, and present only modest execution risk. The investors in HSBC transactions give us a top 10 deposit market share in New York City Metro and over 1 million new customers who collectively we feel we can do more for. We also gained a big augmentation to our digital bank customer base from HSBC's online bank, and we gained a thin branch network in Washington, D.C. and Miami. Our integration efforts so far are progressing nicely. Our JMP acquisition is also strategically compelling. Upon closing the deal in mid-Q4, we'll have a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, healthcare and financial services, plus we gain an equities business that is very well run, focused and highly regarded. As nonbank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks and private equity ownership of companies continues to increase, it's important that we broaden our capabilities to be able to compete successfully in this new landscape. We will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base, given these expanded capabilities. Also worth noting is that the Willamette transaction dramatically expands our valuation services business with a prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort. So to sum up, we're taking serious strides forward as an organization in 2021 and we feel very good about our positioning and our future outlook. With that, I'll turn it over to John. All right. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up to Q&A, please. The one last point to add, it's Bruce, would be the demand deposits now are about 32% of total deposits. So, that's been an effort where we've really focused on trying to raise that as a percentage of our total funding base. And we've had some good success on the consumer side in mass affluent and growing the commercial side. And so, we feel really good about where that sits. Percentage of digital sales. I would just add -- Ken, I would just add that this has been an issue of great interest for analysts and investors like what's been the impact of PPP. We always view it as something that was transitory that eventually these were nice earning asset for us for 2021, but they would very quickly start to reduce, and then they would fall off and not have much of an impact on '22. So the real was can we develop enough loan growth to basically substitute core consumer loans, in particular, for the PPP loans that are running off. And we think with the soft loan growth we had in Q3 and what we're expecting in Q4, mission accomplished that we'll be in good position to offset any future impacts as it relates to the first half and all of '22. Yes. What's weighing against that is the personal unsecured portfolio that we've ran up about two years ago and then decided it's best when the COVID era hit to run that back down and stop new originations. So that's been a little bit of a deadweight in the unsecured area which masks a little bit the nice growth we've had in Citizens Pay and some of the rebounding that we're seeing in card. Brendan, you may have the exact numbers. So what's left of that at this point. Probably also -- you hit on the point, the middle market is where you're seeing that take-up on line utilization for bigger companies... 40%. Yes. And I would just add, too, that we see these secular trends. We see private equity pools of capital growing and looking to put money to work an opportunity to gain some very attractive leverage levels and financing costs are low. So those trends will continue. And one of the reasons why we're hell-bent on assembling broader capabilities, including what we've done with some of the M&A boutique acquisitions in JMP, we want to be an intermediary in those flows of putting money to work. And if our middle market companies want to sell themselves, we can take them to market and get a good price. So, we've got the customer base. We increasingly have the product capabilities. And so that's reason for optimism in on of itself. I think we'll continue to gain a lot of synergies as we look out into '22. Yes. And you have the regulatory approval I would just add a couple of points there, John. First off, on HSBC, the price is tied to what comes over. So if there is any runoff, we would have a shock absorber there in terms of what the ultimate premium is that we pay. And secondly, just when it comes to JMP, we're working very diligently to try to get that closed mid-fourth quarter here. So we should have four to six weeks, say, in the results here in Q4, which would be accretive, of course. It's just focusing on the use cases and where we can differentiate ourselves. And so we've got essential effort enterprise payments capability that's really coordinating between commercial and consumer to drive our decision-making there and make sure that we're investing in things that will really drive future growth. Yes, we did give the numbers that it is a 15 delta. And the reason that it shows a 7 basis points on that is there's a numerator effect and the denominator effect, Vivek. So you have loans running off, which affects the denominator. So it really doubles the impact. You probably have about 3 basis points from the NII pickup and then you get three to four for having the loan balances run down and be forgiven. So yes, it's really -- we're at about an inflection point there, Vivek. So with that steeper curve, as John indicated, front book, back book when you factor in reduced amortization, we're now going to see that turn to be a tailwind from being a headwind for the first three quarters of the year. It sounds like Kristin, that we could probably shed some light and be a little more transparent in that whole unsecured area for future presentation at a conference or in our general releases. Thanks for the question. Yes. All right. Thank you very much. So thanks, folks, for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Everybody, stay well. Thanks."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes, similar trends on the consumer side. The noninterest-bearing deposits have been very sticky despite consumer activity and spending picking up the deposits have been hanging around. And so they're still a bit elevated with the surge deposits, the second and third round stimulus generally were not spent. They were more saved or used to pay down debt, and we're seeing that with the balances hanging around the customers' pockets. On the interest-bearing side, we're seeing a rundown of CDs and it's generally replaced with low-cost deposits with basic savings and some low interest-bearing products like CDs. So that's allowing the cost of funds to continue to gear down, consumer cost of funds all in sub 6 basis points now. So we're kind of at basement levels and still seeing the deposits very, very sticky. Yes, similar discipline in consumer. I'd say there's some asset classes still are mildly elevated on what we would tend to see in this rate cycle like auto or the spreads are a little bit expanded. We've got front book, back book challenges given the state of the yield curve that our back book, the runoff is at a higher yield than what we're putting on. But front book returns are still very, very strong. I'd say there's one or two spots where we're seeing some intensity and competition on returns, particularly where there's fintechs involved, whether it's in point of sale or student lending in particular. But we're keeping our discipline and making sure we're priced to adequate returns to support driving up our ROTCE. And we feel good about able to get growth and make that balance, as you can see in our numbers. Yes. On the consumer side, I do, I see us continuing to be able to sort of moderately accelerate our pace of loan growth. And keep in mind that our growth levels now when you think about the last question around elevated deposits in an environment where customers are also flushed with cash. So as that starts to draw down, we expect loan growth to pick up even more as consumers need more leverage where right now, they're sitting on a lot of cash. So we feel really good about the medium term for loan growth prospects. Yes. Great question. It's Brendan. We look at a lot of different metrics on digital. I'd say, when we have the customers' primary relationship, the digital active users are incredibly high. It's over 80% of our customer base is digitally engaged. So, we feel good about that foundation. Our efforts now are moving from just general active to full-service transactional banking done in a much more everyday way on mobile. So we've got a lot of efforts underway across the Company, which are driving these metrics up, including in the branches and the call center efforts communicate and nudge our customers to get more engaged with digital. It's hugely retentive for us with our customers, but also, as you know, if we can get them really engaged, we can pivot the branches more to advice and there's a cost dynamic here at play that we can then go back and reinvest in the top of the funnel for customer acquisition growth. So, we feel really good about the trends in mobile and I see a lot of upside here looking forward. Sorry, percentage of digital sales. Yes, it's rapidly growing, and it's a very different category by category. Some of our lending businesses are principally digital first, and you'll see in things like student a 75% to 80% rate of digital, whereas something like DDA and deposits, it's more in the 25% to 30% range, but growing two years ago, it was in the 15% range. So, we're seeing active upticks. The branch channel for basic deposit products is still the largest source of customer acquisition, but there's some value coming into play. Yes. It's about a little shy of $900 million left on the personal loan book, and it's about $150 million-ish of a drag quarter-on-quarter to loan growth is one of the other book fits and rundown mode for us is marine RV as well that's all over years Longer duration that have been built in our run rate. The biggest drag is really the personal book. So $900 million or so. Yes, it's Brendan. Look, I think Zelle, the rails that have been built for Zelle are adequate. And I think the industry including Citizens needs to kind of take control of the UI layer that sits above the rails and innovate on our own around the customer experience, whether it's pure payments, that's facilitated with Zelle or whether it's purchasing something direct with the merchant, which would be more a Citizens Pay platform. So, we're making big investments in both of those environments so you can see a world where those capabilities converge a little bit. And it's a similar experience, whether you're buying something from a merchant or whether you're sending money to a friend, I think that's possible. But I think the rails are adequate. I don't necessarily think Zelle in particular, needs do anything dramatic to innovate. I think it's more around what we can do in the UI layer to make things easier for customers to increase engagement as you can see our numbers, that's happening. And we continue to want to scale that up further and get more customers deeper engaged. Yes. The growth in Citizens stay has been pretty substantial. So all things kind of buy now pay later is up around 40% year-over-year with balances, and we continue to see that accelerate. We've had a lot of activity in the back half of this year on bringing on new clients, and it takes a while for these things to ramp. They've got -- we pilot them, they come online, we work with merchants to bring them to life to market them to their customers. So it's a bit of a ramp-up period. And so, all the leading activities that need to happen to continue to have confidence that this can scale through 2022 and beyond are there. So, we feel pretty good that it's headed in the right direction. We're building a lot of new technical capabilities that's broadening out our value proposition within Citizens Pay as well. So, underlying very, very good, healthy growth."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Alan and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of second quarter results referencing our presentation which you can find on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional color.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks Kristin. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through the second quarter, driving forward on key initiatives in both consumer and commercial, accelerating our digital transformation, making steady progress on TOP 6 and announcing the acquisition of HSBC's East Coast branches and online bank. The diversity and resilience of our business model was evident as record revenue and capital markets and wealth partially offset the sizable drop in mortgage. Our credit results continue to be excellent given further improvement in the economy. The headline numbers for the quarter with EPS of $1.46 and ROTCE of 17.7% were flattered by a sizable reserve release. Importantly, we feel PPNR has now bottomed and growth should resume in the second half. We achieved 1% average loan growth in the quarter, a little less than projected as pay downs on PPP loans and across the back book and commercial offset generally good levels of originations. We did a nice job on expenses, protecting the areas aligned with our growth initiatives, while delivering on our expense efficiencies associated with TOP. Looking out to the second half, we believe we will see a pickup in loan growth, particularly on the consumer side and student point of sale finance and auto. In commercial, we should start to see gradual growth in line utilization off of low levels along with the pickup in deal related financings. Mortgage revenues should rebound modestly, given hedge losses in Q2 and generally strong production, while capital markets pipelines remain healthy. We expect to return to positive operating leverage in both Q3 and Q4. Credit should continue to be excellent. We are now calling for further improvement in charge-offs to 20 basis points to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 25 basis points to 35 basis points for the full year. We continue to feel good about our progress and our ability to come out of the pandemic period with increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus our peers over time.\nJohn Woods: Thanks Bruce and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $656 million and EPS of $1.46. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.7%, which includes the impact of the sizable credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.6 billion was down slightly linked quarter on lower mortgage fee income with net interest income up slightly given interest earning asset growth. Average loans were up 1% in the quarter on the strength of retail originations hitting an all-time high giving us good momentum heading into the second half of the year. Key highlights include record results in capital markets and wealth. Mortgage fees were lower as margins continue to tighten, although origination volumes remain quite strong and we continue to control expenses down 2% quarter-over-quarter. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $213 million, which reflects sustained macroeconomic improvement and strong credit performance with lower charge-offs. Our ACL ratio is now at 1.75% excluding PPP loans. And finally, we are in a very strong capital position with CET1 at 10.3% after returning $168 million to shareholders in dividends during the quarter. We also continue to grow our tangible book value per share, which was $33.95 at quarter end, up 6% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll refer to a few slides and give you some key takeaways for the second quarter, I'll then outline our outlook for the third quarter. Net interest income on slide six was up 1% linked quarter, given interest earning asset growth and higher day count. Average loans were up 1% and net interest margin was down slightly. The net interest margin reflects lower earning asset yields reflecting the low rate environment. Spread pressures and elevated lending competition although improved funding mix and better deposit pricing are helping to mitigate these factors. Interest-bearing deposit costs improved four basis points to 16 basis points from continued discipline on deposit pricing. Our asset sensitivity increased to about 10.7% from 8.5% at the end of the first quarter. The increase primarily reflects the ongoing stability in deposit levels and the improvement in funding mix given the increase in low cost deposits. Referring to slide seven, we delivered solid fee results again this quarter with record results in capital markets and wealth, reflecting the ongoing investments in our capabilities and the benefit of acquisitions.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. . Our first question will come from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.\nKen Zerbe: All right, great. Thank you. Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Morning.\nKen Zerbe: I saw a few references to TOP 7, so -- in your press release. I was actually hoping you could talk a little bit more about what we might expect from the new TOP 7 program and also how it might differ from TOP 6? Thank you.\nJohn Woods: Sure, Ken, it's John here. Yes, I mean I think as you've seen over the years we've been, just been part of our culture to really dig in on this kind of mindset of continuous improvement. And last year TOP 6 was somewhat unique and it's transformational sort of two-year profile. We are very pleased with how that played out, delivering on the expectations of $400 million to $425 million in run rate saves. So, we're excited about that. And there is a lot of traditional kind of top contributors in TOP 6 and there was a transformational aspect to us. So, that made it a little bit unique. I think TOP 7 may bring us back to some of that foundational sort of continuous approach to driving efficiencies and a couple of areas that we're looking at sort of looking at around to some of the areas that we were able to sort of drive in TOP 6 such as agile delivery and simplifying how we were operating. Next-gen tech has another, call it next wave of rationalizing applications associated with it. So, I think you could see sort of a 2.0 in revisiting some of the transformational areas of TOP 6. But then just continuing on our bread and butter to try to simplify how we operate in fundamentals around how we manage the place and I'd suggest that maybe there is some more room to go on optimizing branch density. But really just getting back to what we do, which is driving continuous improvement year-over-year.\nOperator: Pardon me. The next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nMatt O'Connor: Bruce, I was hoping you could elaborate a bit on your M&A strategy, obviously you just announced HSBC branch deal and have done some fee deals. But there were, I guess some interviews and quotes from you few weeks back about being more open to bank deals I think. So, maybe just update us on your thinking there. Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Sure. So, Matt, I think we've been very clear all along that we had some great strategic initiatives that should lead to very good organic growth for Citizens and that's kind of top of the heap in terms of priorities. We've focused next on fee based bolt-on acquisitions. And with some success, I think, you're seeing the results in our commercial business now that we've kind of incorporated M&A capabilities into our offerings to our customer base and the mortgage acquisition clearly was thoughtful and well timed and then the wealth, Clarfeld acquisition has been a home run in terms of opening up cross-sell particularly to our commercial business owner. So, we are pursuing more of those. And so, I feel good that there'll be some announcements over the course of the second half of the year in that regard. So stay tuned there. With respect to full bank acquisitions, I think the first step here was this HSBC transaction, which I think strategically makes good sense for us and also financially is very attractive and compelling. And so one of the things that we like about that is it fills in some geographical holes that we have, particularly the New York metro area and pushes us down a little bit mid-Atlantic South toward Washington and then gets us a beachhead in South Florida. So, those are all things that I think fit well with our distribution strategy. And if we could find potentially other bank transactions that fit that bill that potentially could strengthen the footprint and help our distribution strategy and we can get it at the right price and it's the right culture and meets the strategy et cetera with compelling financial economics, we'd be open to that. I don't think it's something that again is a driving desire here, I think will be a bit opportunistic if we can find a good deal, we would certainly consider it.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead please.\nKen Usdin: Thanks. Good morning guys. Wanted to ask on the outlook a couple of things about the NII side. John, last quarter you had mentioned that you had expected flat earning assets and we continue to see the strong deposit growth come through. And I'm just wondering, again, you're calling for flat earnings assets, but it looks like the deposit growth remains pretty strong for the industry and for you guys. So just wondering what are you seeing there and expecting in terms of overall deposit growth and why that would only result in flattish earning assets.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean, I think that we've been for some time now thinking that with economic activity you start to see potentially some of those deposits to flatten out. They've just been continuing to grow and we've seen strong flows. I'd say what's been nice about that is that, that's been coming in the categories we want them to show up and meeting demand deposits have been really strong underpinning all of that. So, that's been quite good. I think the -- and what that's resulted in is continuing to allow us to run our deposit playbook and you're seeing our interest bearing deposit costs decline and headed toward really low teens or even better by the end of the year. So that's been great. I do think that, as you see economic recovery in the second half of the year, we would suspect that some of that growth will begin to moderate and possibly even some of it begin to run off, but we have -- most of that surge deposits that we saw in 2020 and early 2021, we think is going to stick around. So, as much as two-thirds or more, and then that's great fuel and great support for what we're -- what we expect to see later in the year with this -- which is loan growth and as you get into 2022, lots of momentum. So, those are some of the thoughts I have on the deposit side.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, Ken that spot numbers are quite optimistic. So, I think we had a record level of originations for loans in the consumer side in the second quarter. We had a very strong level of that in commercial which goes back to pre-pandemic level of originations. We're still seeing relatively high pay downs which mutes that a little bit, but I think when we look out into Q3 in particular, we have a bunch of seasonal strength in businesses like student and point of sale combined with I think those pay downs should start to moderate a little bit. So, we're quite optimistic that we'll see very, very strong spot loan growth that should kick in Q3 and extend into Q4. The average is based on timing of when this all happens may not fully reflect that in Q3, but I would stay focused on the spot number.\nOperator: Your next question will come from David George with Baird. Go ahead please.\nDavid George: Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question on PPP, could you disclose the dollar amount of PPP loans in the quarter and then I've got a follow-up on the outlook?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean, if -- basically, at the end of the quarter, the average balances during 2Q was about $4.5 billion.\nDavid George: $4.5 billion. Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then with respect to the Q3 outlook particularly specifically on fees, it looks like you're expecting a fairly nice jump in fee activity, and I trust, part of that's going to come from mortgage. John, I thought I think you said $14 million relative to Q2. That is about $85 million number with MSR-related, and then there was a $10 million agency fee impact. Was there anything else that impacted that number? I'm just trying to get a sense as to how much of a balance, you're expecting over the next quarter or two.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean, I think, yes, that's right. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's about $24 million of unique items that feel unique to 2Q. And so that's something that will set us up nicely for 3Q, starting with that without expecting those things to recur. We do think that in the third quarter volumes will help -- will hold up and we may have some modest decline in gain on -- on gain on sale margins, but given what's going on with those sort of non-recurring items from 2Q as well as, still a strong volume quarter that we do think that mortgage rebounds into the third quarter.\nOperator: Your next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Just on the loan front, I know you mentioned that you're seeing some loan competition around loan pricing. So, I just wanted to, if you can elaborate on that and what areas are you seeing it. And if you could maybe give us some color in terms of your new production loan yields in the various areas that would be helpful. Then I have a follow-up on capital. Thanks.\nDon McCree: Yes. Hey, John, it's Don McCree. We definitely are seeing price competition in terms competition across the board. So, part of the reason that our loan growth is a little bit more tepid than it might be is, we're trying to stay pretty disciplined on price and terms. So, down maybe 10 basis points or something is what I'm saying generally in terms of our price -- our spreads across the board. I think, just elaborating on what John and Bruce has said on loan growth, we're out with our clients in person that which is actually quite gratifying. And the thing that's kind of restricting utilization is all the supply chain back-ups and some of the labor. And as those begin to clear, particularly labor, we think clears up toward the September time frame and the supply chain begins to normalize toward the fourth quarter-ish. We would expect more normal working capital build the resume. So, that's what gives me a lot of confidence. And then as John said, we've got about our entire downdraft and spot loan growth in the quarter was PPP prepayments and that's going to begin to moderate. So, there is some headwinds that we've been selling into which should clear themselves out and get some good momentum as we move into the back-end, but we're going to stay disciplined on terms of price and credit.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Brendan?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, similar on consumer I'd say, ex-PPP, spot balances were up just shy of 3%. So, pretty decent growth overall despite as Bruce pointed out some rundown in the back book. We're seeing really good strength and record originations, really the highest level of originations, we've had since we're a public company here in Q2. So, the momentum, should continue in the second half of the year. And then as both Bruce and John pointed out, adding in iUp, the Apple iPhone upgrade program, which is typically a late summer, early fall event. And then the seasonality of InSchool lending should really give us another round of growth heading into the second half of the year. But pricing has been really competitive in a couple of fronts, particularly on student loan refinancing as rates have ticked up and now are starting to peel back a little bit. That's been a particular place of intensity. I'd say on assets like auto, pricing intensity has picked up a little bit, spreads still remain pretty high. So, we're looking at that business still as a double-digit ROE business right now with originations which is elevated from normalized levels in auto given the short duration. So, we're able to hit record originations in auto as an example with still somewhat elevated yields, which has been really, really good. So, I'm optimistic -- that was actually the last point home equity, which is probably a little bit unique from what you're hearing against peers. We've been really, really strong on originations for home equity. In fact, we are seeing some benchmarking that puts us in probably the top two or three lenders across the U.S. although only operating in 11 states right now for home equity lending. This quarter, the spot balance has actually grew, and from a quarterly basis, that's the first time since the financial crisis, we've seen net loan growth in home equity and our credit card book is also bottom. So, some of these de-levering trends with all the stimulus out there in the market with consumers, I think in our line of credit products have hit the bottom. We're starting to see signs that those returning. So, hopefully a tailwind as we would think about H2.\nBruce Van Saun: Great. John, do you want to finish up with anything or?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean, I think...\nJohn Pancari: Yes. Sorry, go ahead John.\nBruce Van Saun: I meant, John Woods. Sorry.\nJohn Woods: Lot of Johns, it's such a unique name. Yes, I mean, I think you were also -- you were just kind of our asset value yield. And you know in the second quarter, we were able to see origination yields up in the retail side of things due to a number of -- due to the diversity of the portfolio. And we suspect that may -- that's something that we may see continue into the third quarter with origination yields rising, and that tends to temper the front book, back book dynamic that I think maybe you were trying to get after.\nJohn Pancari: No, that's helpful. Thanks so much for all that. And then on capital, I know you saw some good strengthening in the CET1, the 10.3%, I guess Bruce, if you could just maybe talk about how you think about that target of 9.75% to 10%. I mean we're starting to see some of your peers nudge down their targets, their internal targets a bit. Wanted to get your thoughts on that. Is there room to potentially adopt the lower level there on the CET1 internal target? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Sure. But we're comfortable with that 9.75% to 10%. As you know, over time we brought that down, it was 10% in the quarter, then it was 10% to 10% in a quarter, then it was 10% and it's 9.75% to 10%. So, I think as we've matured as a company, as we've demonstrated good risk discipline in how we've grown the loan book and you can see we've come through the pandemic with a low level of credit losses. I think some of that 'new guy' little bit of conservatism we had coming off the IPO, we're starting to shed that and move back closer to where pure targets are. So, for now we're above the 9.75% to 10%. So, I don't see any real burning desire to change it. But over time, certainly the pack moves down a little bit. We have plenty of room versus our SCB target. And certainly I think the risk profile would permit that.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.\nPeter Winter: Good morning. It doesn't -- I just want to ask about the swaps hedging. It doesn't look like you added any swaps this quarter. And I'm just wondering what the plan is going forward. I do know rates are obviously lower. I'm just wondering what level rates need to get to before you think maybe adding some more swaps.\nJohn Woods: Yes, we actually did have some swaps this quarter.\nPeter Winter: You did?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean, we added maybe, call it $1 billion or so. And we added $1 billion or so later in the quarter and actually $1 billion right at the beginning of the quarter. So, really right around $2 billion. You add that to the $6 billion, we executed late in the first quarter. And we've got around $8 billion that we've added as part of our sort of early stage kind of dollar-cost averaging into where the rate environment. And when you look at the overall averages, we did that, call it mid to high 70s on average, which is mid to high 70 basis points -- 75 basis points to 80 basis points on that overall portfolio and you know in the five years sort of well below that today. So -- and the last couple of billion which I think was over 90 basis points. So, I think that we've been able to start to look opportunistically at ways to really sort of monetize some of that asset sensitivity over time. And we're still over 10%, actually close to 11% asset sensitivity. So, there's lots of opportunity to continue to add to the swap portfolio as and when the rate environment continues to improve. And our year-over-year headwinds from swap has declined significantly and markedly as a result of all these actions. So I think we're -- I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of the swap portfolio.\nOperator:  We'll go to line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead please.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning Bruce. Good morning John.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nJohn Woods: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: I got two questions. First for you, John, can you give us some color, I noticed in your outlook, you indicated that you guys think that the 10-year or the expectation for the 10-year will be 1.35%. Currently today, as you know, it's well below that, if it comes in at 1.15% for the quarter, what would that do to the net interest margin assumptions that you have in net interest income. And then second for you, Bruce, the president, now obviously came out with the executive order on M&A to scrutinize deals more closely. Does that raise the risk of your HSBC deal at all? Thank you.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and knock off the first part of that, Gerard. The -- in terms of, so we've gotten through a few weeks of the quarter breaks were a little higher. We do have an expectation of an average 1.35% for the quarter. If it were to drop off, call it into that range, maybe we would see, call it $5 million-ish or so of impact to NII. Maybe a basis point or two on NIM, but I would hasten to add that there are offsets, some puts and takes when you're operating in an environment like that. More broadly, you could find better opportunities in terms of offsetting that on the deposit side. You could also see as we've demonstrated back in the crisis and in the pandemic, the resilience of the franchise broadly even beyond that, net interest income and what the downside rate protection that the mortgage company actually provides which is extremely powerful. So, I think that maybe there is a modest impact from the first order effect. If the 10 year stays down there, but I think we have, we have mitigants in terms of on the deposit side, and then more broadly in the fee area.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, part two of that, Gerard, I don't see the executive order impacting the HSBC transaction. So, it's -- that's a relatively modest in size transaction, that straightforward and in any case the EO out for comment. It's going to take quite a while to settle that one down and more broadly I think bank mergers are probably among the most heavily scrutinized as it is. So, whether there is a meaningful impact down the track on that remains to be seen, but certainly as it relates to the HSBC transaction, I don't see any impact at all.\nOperator: Your next question will be from David Konrad with KBW. Go ahead.\nDavid Konrad: Yes, good morning. It sounds like definitely very positive on loan growth trends, maybe more spot and then average to because of timing, but just curious I think historically, you've talked about a mid-single-digit to high single-digit full year spot loan growth. I just wondered if you're still comfortable with that?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean I think that's right. I mean, when you look at, look at where we're coming out in the second quarter in terms of spot, you see that momentum that's being generated and that's continuing into the third quarter with the 2% to 3% guide that we highlighted. I think you absolutely could get to that. And the expectation is to get to that mid-single-digit range.\nBruce Van Saun: And I think I'd hasten to add, when you look at it excluding PPP, that's an important metric to look at when you're considering the underlying fundamental flows that we're seeing both in commercial and consumer. And--\nBrendan Coughlin: That was 1.8% in Q2, which annualizes to over 7% and then the 2% to 3%, we're calling out for the third quarter. Yes, we can do the math on that.\nBruce Van Saun: That includes -- that's -- so it will add 1% or more to that ex-PPP in 3Q. And so, I think you're--\nBrendan Coughlin: So, one of the aspects, I think that's unique to us is just the number of sales we set out to catch the wind there is some wind. So, we have a very broad lending portfolio on the consumer side and we play in some very attractive verticals on the commercial side. So, broadly feel good that we can certainly get to nominal GDP growth on a recurring basis.\nOperator: And at this time we have no further questions in queue. You may proceed.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay, great. Thanks again for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thanks again.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude your conference call for today. Thanks for your participation and for using AT&T Event Teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

We also continue to grow our tangible book value per share, which was $33.95 at quarter end, up 6% compared with a year ago. Next, I'll refer to a few slides and give you some key takeaways for the second quarter, I'll then outline our outlook for the third quarter. Net interest income on slide six was up 1% linked quarter, given interest earning asset growth and higher day count. Average loans were up 1% and net interest margin was down slightly. The net interest margin reflects lower earning asset yields reflecting the low rate environment. Spread pressures and elevated lending competition although improved funding mix and better deposit pricing are helping to mitigate these factors. Interest-bearing deposit costs improved four basis points to 16 basis points from continued discipline on deposit pricing. Our asset sensitivity increased to about 10.7% from 8.5% at the end of the first quarter. The increase primarily reflects the ongoing stability in deposit levels and the improvement in funding mix given the increase in low cost deposits. Referring to slide seven, we delivered solid fee results again this quarter with record results in capital markets and wealth, reflecting the ongoing investments in our capabilities and the benefit of acquisitions. Sure, Ken, it's John here. Yes, I mean I think as you've seen over the years we've been, just been part of our culture to really dig in on this kind of mindset of continuous improvement. And last year TOP 6 was somewhat unique and it's transformational sort of two-year profile. We are very pleased with how that played out, delivering on the expectations of $400 million to $425 million in run rate saves. So, we're excited about that. And there is a lot of traditional kind of top contributors in TOP 6 and there was a transformational aspect to us. So, that made it a little bit unique. I think TOP 7 may bring us back to some of that foundational sort of continuous approach to driving efficiencies and a couple of areas that we're looking at sort of looking at around to some of the areas that we were able to sort of drive in TOP 6 such as agile delivery and simplifying how we were operating. Next-gen tech has another, call it next wave of rationalizing applications associated with it. So, I think you could see sort of a 2.0 in revisiting some of the transformational areas of TOP 6. But then just continuing on our bread and butter to try to simplify how we operate in fundamentals around how we manage the place and I'd suggest that maybe there is some more room to go on optimizing branch density. But really just getting back to what we do, which is driving continuous improvement year-over-year. Yes, I mean, I think that we've been for some time now thinking that with economic activity you start to see potentially some of those deposits to flatten out. They've just been continuing to grow and we've seen strong flows. I'd say what's been nice about that is that, that's been coming in the categories we want them to show up and meeting demand deposits have been really strong underpinning all of that. So, that's been quite good. I think the -- and what that's resulted in is continuing to allow us to run our deposit playbook and you're seeing our interest bearing deposit costs decline and headed toward really low teens or even better by the end of the year. So that's been great. I do think that, as you see economic recovery in the second half of the year, we would suspect that some of that growth will begin to moderate and possibly even some of it begin to run off, but we have -- most of that surge deposits that we saw in 2020 and early 2021, we think is going to stick around. So, as much as two-thirds or more, and then that's great fuel and great support for what we're -- what we expect to see later in the year with this -- which is loan growth and as you get into 2022, lots of momentum. So, those are some of the thoughts I have on the deposit side. Yes, I mean, if -- basically, at the end of the quarter, the average balances during 2Q was about $4.5 billion. Yes, I mean, I think, yes, that's right. As I mentioned in my remarks, it's about $24 million of unique items that feel unique to 2Q. And so that's something that will set us up nicely for 3Q, starting with that without expecting those things to recur. We do think that in the third quarter volumes will help -- will hold up and we may have some modest decline in gain on -- on gain on sale margins, but given what's going on with those sort of non-recurring items from 2Q as well as, still a strong volume quarter that we do think that mortgage rebounds into the third quarter. Yes, I mean, I think... Lot of Johns, it's such a unique name. Yes, I mean, I think you were also -- you were just kind of our asset value yield. And you know in the second quarter, we were able to see origination yields up in the retail side of things due to a number of -- due to the diversity of the portfolio. And we suspect that may -- that's something that we may see continue into the third quarter with origination yields rising, and that tends to temper the front book, back book dynamic that I think maybe you were trying to get after. Yes, we actually did have some swaps this quarter. Yes, I mean, we added maybe, call it $1 billion or so. And we added $1 billion or so later in the quarter and actually $1 billion right at the beginning of the quarter. So, really right around $2 billion. You add that to the $6 billion, we executed late in the first quarter. And we've got around $8 billion that we've added as part of our sort of early stage kind of dollar-cost averaging into where the rate environment. And when you look at the overall averages, we did that, call it mid to high 70s on average, which is mid to high 70 basis points -- 75 basis points to 80 basis points on that overall portfolio and you know in the five years sort of well below that today. So -- and the last couple of billion which I think was over 90 basis points. So, I think that we've been able to start to look opportunistically at ways to really sort of monetize some of that asset sensitivity over time. And we're still over 10%, actually close to 11% asset sensitivity. So, there's lots of opportunity to continue to add to the swap portfolio as and when the rate environment continues to improve. And our year-over-year headwinds from swap has declined significantly and markedly as a result of all these actions. So I think we're -- I think we're in pretty good shape in terms of the swap portfolio. Good morning. Yes, I'll go ahead and knock off the first part of that, Gerard. The -- in terms of, so we've gotten through a few weeks of the quarter breaks were a little higher. We do have an expectation of an average 1.35% for the quarter. If it were to drop off, call it into that range, maybe we would see, call it $5 million-ish or so of impact to NII. Maybe a basis point or two on NIM, but I would hasten to add that there are offsets, some puts and takes when you're operating in an environment like that. More broadly, you could find better opportunities in terms of offsetting that on the deposit side. You could also see as we've demonstrated back in the crisis and in the pandemic, the resilience of the franchise broadly even beyond that, net interest income and what the downside rate protection that the mortgage company actually provides which is extremely powerful. So, I think that maybe there is a modest impact from the first order effect. If the 10 year stays down there, but I think we have, we have mitigants in terms of on the deposit side, and then more broadly in the fee area. Yes, I mean I think that's right. I mean, when you look at, look at where we're coming out in the second quarter in terms of spot, you see that momentum that's being generated and that's continuing into the third quarter with the 2% to 3% guide that we highlighted. I think you absolutely could get to that. And the expectation is to get to that mid-single-digit range."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes. Hey, John, it's Don McCree. We definitely are seeing price competition in terms competition across the board. So, part of the reason that our loan growth is a little bit more tepid than it might be is, we're trying to stay pretty disciplined on price and terms. So, down maybe 10 basis points or something is what I'm saying generally in terms of our price -- our spreads across the board. I think, just elaborating on what John and Bruce has said on loan growth, we're out with our clients in person that which is actually quite gratifying. And the thing that's kind of restricting utilization is all the supply chain back-ups and some of the labor. And as those begin to clear, particularly labor, we think clears up toward the September time frame and the supply chain begins to normalize toward the fourth quarter-ish. We would expect more normal working capital build the resume. So, that's what gives me a lot of confidence. And then as John said, we've got about our entire downdraft and spot loan growth in the quarter was PPP prepayments and that's going to begin to moderate. So, there is some headwinds that we've been selling into which should clear themselves out and get some good momentum as we move into the back-end, but we're going to stay disciplined on terms of price and credit."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks Kristin. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through the second quarter, driving forward on key initiatives in both consumer and commercial, accelerating our digital transformation, making steady progress on TOP 6 and announcing the acquisition of HSBC's East Coast branches and online bank. The diversity and resilience of our business model was evident as record revenue and capital markets and wealth partially offset the sizable drop in mortgage. Our credit results continue to be excellent given further improvement in the economy. The headline numbers for the quarter with EPS of $1.46 and ROTCE of 17.7% were flattered by a sizable reserve release. Importantly, we feel PPNR has now bottomed and growth should resume in the second half. We achieved 1% average loan growth in the quarter, a little less than projected as pay downs on PPP loans and across the back book and commercial offset generally good levels of originations. We did a nice job on expenses, protecting the areas aligned with our growth initiatives, while delivering on our expense efficiencies associated with TOP. Looking out to the second half, we believe we will see a pickup in loan growth, particularly on the consumer side and student point of sale finance and auto. In commercial, we should start to see gradual growth in line utilization off of low levels along with the pickup in deal related financings. Mortgage revenues should rebound modestly, given hedge losses in Q2 and generally strong production, while capital markets pipelines remain healthy. We expect to return to positive operating leverage in both Q3 and Q4. Credit should continue to be excellent. We are now calling for further improvement in charge-offs to 20 basis points to 25 basis points in the third quarter and 25 basis points to 35 basis points for the full year. We continue to feel good about our progress and our ability to come out of the pandemic period with increasing differentiation and growth in franchise value versus our peers over time. Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A. Morning. Good morning. Sure. So, Matt, I think we've been very clear all along that we had some great strategic initiatives that should lead to very good organic growth for Citizens and that's kind of top of the heap in terms of priorities. We've focused next on fee based bolt-on acquisitions. And with some success, I think, you're seeing the results in our commercial business now that we've kind of incorporated M&A capabilities into our offerings to our customer base and the mortgage acquisition clearly was thoughtful and well timed and then the wealth, Clarfeld acquisition has been a home run in terms of opening up cross-sell particularly to our commercial business owner. So, we are pursuing more of those. And so, I feel good that there'll be some announcements over the course of the second half of the year in that regard. So stay tuned there. With respect to full bank acquisitions, I think the first step here was this HSBC transaction, which I think strategically makes good sense for us and also financially is very attractive and compelling. And so one of the things that we like about that is it fills in some geographical holes that we have, particularly the New York metro area and pushes us down a little bit mid-Atlantic South toward Washington and then gets us a beachhead in South Florida. So, those are all things that I think fit well with our distribution strategy. And if we could find potentially other bank transactions that fit that bill that potentially could strengthen the footprint and help our distribution strategy and we can get it at the right price and it's the right culture and meets the strategy et cetera with compelling financial economics, we'd be open to that. I don't think it's something that again is a driving desire here, I think will be a bit opportunistic if we can find a good deal, we would certainly consider it. I would just add to that, Ken that spot numbers are quite optimistic. So, I think we had a record level of originations for loans in the consumer side in the second quarter. We had a very strong level of that in commercial which goes back to pre-pandemic level of originations. We're still seeing relatively high pay downs which mutes that a little bit, but I think when we look out into Q3 in particular, we have a bunch of seasonal strength in businesses like student and point of sale combined with I think those pay downs should start to moderate a little bit. So, we're quite optimistic that we'll see very, very strong spot loan growth that should kick in Q3 and extend into Q4. The average is based on timing of when this all happens may not fully reflect that in Q3, but I would stay focused on the spot number. Okay. Brendan? Great. John, do you want to finish up with anything or? I meant, John Woods. Sorry. Sure. But we're comfortable with that 9.75% to 10%. As you know, over time we brought that down, it was 10% in the quarter, then it was 10% to 10% in a quarter, then it was 10% and it's 9.75% to 10%. So, I think as we've matured as a company, as we've demonstrated good risk discipline in how we've grown the loan book and you can see we've come through the pandemic with a low level of credit losses. I think some of that 'new guy' little bit of conservatism we had coming off the IPO, we're starting to shed that and move back closer to where pure targets are. So, for now we're above the 9.75% to 10%. So, I don't see any real burning desire to change it. But over time, certainly the pack moves down a little bit. We have plenty of room versus our SCB target. And certainly I think the risk profile would permit that. Good morning. Yes, part two of that, Gerard, I don't see the executive order impacting the HSBC transaction. So, it's -- that's a relatively modest in size transaction, that straightforward and in any case the EO out for comment. It's going to take quite a while to settle that one down and more broadly I think bank mergers are probably among the most heavily scrutinized as it is. So, whether there is a meaningful impact down the track on that remains to be seen, but certainly as it relates to the HSBC transaction, I don't see any impact at all. And I think I'd hasten to add, when you look at it excluding PPP, that's an important metric to look at when you're considering the underlying fundamental flows that we're seeing both in commercial and consumer. And-- That includes -- that's -- so it will add 1% or more to that ex-PPP in 3Q. And so, I think you're-- Okay, great. Thanks again for dialing in today. We always appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day and everybody stay well. Thanks again."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes, similar on consumer I'd say, ex-PPP, spot balances were up just shy of 3%. So, pretty decent growth overall despite as Bruce pointed out some rundown in the back book. We're seeing really good strength and record originations, really the highest level of originations, we've had since we're a public company here in Q2. So, the momentum, should continue in the second half of the year. And then as both Bruce and John pointed out, adding in iUp, the Apple iPhone upgrade program, which is typically a late summer, early fall event. And then the seasonality of InSchool lending should really give us another round of growth heading into the second half of the year. But pricing has been really competitive in a couple of fronts, particularly on student loan refinancing as rates have ticked up and now are starting to peel back a little bit. That's been a particular place of intensity. I'd say on assets like auto, pricing intensity has picked up a little bit, spreads still remain pretty high. So, we're looking at that business still as a double-digit ROE business right now with originations which is elevated from normalized levels in auto given the short duration. So, we're able to hit record originations in auto as an example with still somewhat elevated yields, which has been really, really good. So, I'm optimistic -- that was actually the last point home equity, which is probably a little bit unique from what you're hearing against peers. We've been really, really strong on originations for home equity. In fact, we are seeing some benchmarking that puts us in probably the top two or three lenders across the U.S. although only operating in 11 states right now for home equity lending. This quarter, the spot balance has actually grew, and from a quarterly basis, that's the first time since the financial crisis, we've seen net loan growth in home equity and our credit card book is also bottom. So, some of these de-levering trends with all the stimulus out there in the market with consumers, I think in our line of credit products have hit the bottom. We're starting to see signs that those returning. So, hopefully a tailwind as we would think about H2. That was 1.8% in Q2, which annualizes to over 7% and then the 2% to 3%, we're calling out for the third quarter. Yes, we can do the math on that. So, one of the aspects, I think that's unique to us is just the number of sales we set out to catch the wind there is some wind. So, we have a very broad lending portfolio on the consumer side and we play in some very attractive verticals on the commercial side. So, broadly feel good that we can certainly get to nominal GDP growth on a recurring basis."

We'll begin this morning's call with the company's standard forward-looking statement disclosure. On this call, representatives of Investors Bancorp, Inc. may make some forward-looking statements with respect to its financial position, results of operations and business. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond Investors Bancorp's control, are difficult to predict and which can cause actual results to materially differ from those expressed or forecast in these forward-looking statements.

For a more complete discussion of the certain risks and uncertainties affecting Investors Bancorp, please see the sections entitled Risk Factors, Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations set forth in Investors Bancorp's filings under the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin Cummings, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Investors Bancorp. Please go ahead.\nKevin Cummings: Okay. Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Call for 2021. Last night, the company reported in its press release, net income of $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. This compares to $75.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 30 last year and $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The fourth quarter of last year, we recorded some noncore transactions that impacted results and improved earnings to $84 million or $0.35 per share. The difference in core operating results of approximately $9 million for the fourth quarter were due to a $6.9 million reduction in prepayment fees, which are included in interest income. This decrease in fees caused a reduction in our net interest margin of eight basis points. Excluding these penalties or these penalty fees, our core margin increased by two basis points. The quarter was also impacted by a reduction in gain on sale of loans in mortgage banking activities of $1.7 million and a more favorable tax rate due to R&D credits recognized in the fourth quarter. These decreases in revenues were offset by cost control by reduced core operating expenses of $2.7 million in the first quarter. All things considered, it was a solid quarter for the bank and a good start to 2021. This time last year, there were major concerns about liquidity, capital and where the credit cycle was going to go. And I'm happy to report that the company declared its cash dividend of $0.14 per share to be paid in May, and this reflects a $0.02 increase from the dividend paid at the height of the pandemic last May of 2020. These results reflect our third straight quarter of double-digit return on tangible equity, and our return on average assets has averaged over 1.07% over that 3-quarter period. When I look back to where we were a year ago, it is remarkable what we have accomplished through this pandemic. A year ago, we were in the midst of the PPP process. Customers and our employees were in fear of touching doorknobs or speaking with each other. There was uncertainty and no one felt comfortable with the normal routines of everyday life. Through grit and determination, we were able to take care of our customers, keep all our retail branches open, and most importantly, protect our employees. Today, we are a stronger bank. Our capital ratios are up approximately 30 basis points. Our credit culture is stronger than ever. And our outlook for 2021 is bright. We are anxious to get all our corporate employees back to the office and look forward to being that bank that serves our customers and communities in both good times and times of crisis. On the credit front, our nonaccrual loans are down $23.8 million or 22% for the fourth quarter and $48.7 million or 37% from September 30 of last year. This reduction in nonaccrual loans was completed with no cumulative net charge-offs as our net charge-offs in the last six months were negative and resulted in net recoveries of $5.7 million for the last two quarters. Our loan loss coverage ratio to nonaccrual loans is 341% this quarter versus 248% last year at March 31. In the commercial portfolio, our total nonaccrual loans of $37.6 million, consisting of 53 loans for an average loan of approximately $709,000, which is down from $79.8 million at September 30 of last year. Our three largest nonaccrual loans at March 31 are: a multifamily loan for $4.6 million, a CRE loan for $3.1 million and a business loan for $2.6 million. The remaining 50 loans in the nonaccrual group reflect an average exposure of $550,000 and is similar to the exposure in our mortgage and consumer portfolio, which has an average loan, nonaccrual, of $191,000. We have a war room mentality with respect to credit but still believe we have a lot of work to do to get through this operating environment and the post effects of the pandemic. Almost every week since June, we have met to discuss our loan exposures and trends in deferred loans due to this pandemic. At March 31, our total deferrals were down to $582 million and include approximately $500 million in loans that are currently paying us interest and are keeping their taxes current. We have made a concerted effort to reach out to our customers during this time to work with them through the crisis. And in a period of uncertainty, we see these times as an opportunity to help our customers and build long-term relationships. With respect to principal and interest deferrals, we have approximately $83 million, of which $23 million in the entertainment category commenced payments as of April 1. The remaining $60 million is made up of 20 loans. And the two largest loans are both multifamily loans for $37 million and $10 million. So of the remaining $50 million -- $60 million, the remaining $60 million, $37 million and $10 million are in two loans. We have recently visited those two properties earlier this month. And the Washington loan -- one loan is in Washington, D.C. with an average loan per unit of approximately $70,000. The complex was recording stronger cash collections in March that we collected at pro forma cash flow of a 1.2% debt service. It is a well-maintained property and should retain its value, and we expect it to be back to full payment at the end of the deferral period. The other loan is in Brooklyn, which we visited earlier this month, and is a 20-unit relatively new building that is fully occupied and is recovering its cash flows after concessions to new apartment dwellers and should not be a problem due to the strong sponsorship, the quality of the building and its amenities. The remaining exposure in this principal and interest deferral is $13 million, which is made up of 18 loans for an average loan of approximately $722,000. So at the end of the day, we feel we have a great handle on the exposure of this $60 million of principal and interest deferral. There's a lot of discussion of what's going on in Manhattan. And in that deferral portfolio, our Manhattan exposure is mainly in the hotel sector for $196 million of the total $367 million that we have in the Manhattan area. All of the loans in the hotel sector and in Manhattan are paying interest and are showing improving trends. The hotels are seeing increased tourist activity but little business travel. These properties are family businesses for multi-generations and have strong sponsorship. The remaining exposure in Manhattan is in multifamily and CRE for $88 million and $38 million, respectively, and have good sponsorship and improving operations and do not show any major issues at this time. As I mentioned earlier, our credit and first-line teams have been meeting on a weekly basis to discuss the progress of the deferral portfolio and other trends in the total commercial portfolio. Last week, we met for several hours to discuss our office portfolio, where we reviewed the top 25 loans for approximately $620 million. All of these loans are current as to interest and principal and there was nothing discussed that would set off alarm bells at this time. We will continue to monitor this and other portfolios at the highest level of management to make sure we stay ahead of the leasing activities in both retail and office and the impact of changes in business practices and workplace activities. Today, we feel we are doing everything possible to manage this credit risk with strong reserves, low delinquency trends and a strong credit and monitoring team in place to manage us through this pandemic. With respect to loan growth, our commercial loans grew 1.3% in the quarter compared to a reduction in loans of 1.4% in the 2020 first quarter. The first quarter is usually a slower quarter for us, and we are optimistic of the activity we are seeing in the marketplace. Our lending teams are engaged and are making calls in the market. They're out in the market, out of the office. We have a strong commercial pipeline, which totals over $3.3 billion and compares to $1.5 billion last year this time and $2.2 billion at year-end. We believe we can grow our loans at a 7% to 8%, maybe 9% pace for 2021. On the deposit front, deposits were down $534 million, which related to planned runoff of higher-costing brokered deposits of $534 million and government deposits of $327 million as our cost of deposits went down 19 basis points for the quarter. Our consumer and business deposits were up $328 million with our noninterest deposits increasing $174 million or 4.8% for the quarter. Noninterest deposits now comprise 20% of deposits, which is a first for the company. We are seeing great activity from the investments we have made in 2019 and 2020 with our business lenders and business development teams generating core deposits and relationships and business loans. We are moving forward with our Berkshire acquisition, which will bring approximately $300 million in loans and $600 million in deposits. We recently agreed to a marketing partnership with the Trenton Thunder, a local Minor League Baseball team in Trenton in the Berkshire market and have been active in coordinating activities with the retail and business teams in that market. It is a great opportunity for us. And we will expand our brand with two additional branches in Bucks County in Pennsylvania. Going into the year 2021, we have strong momentum and continue to see great opportunities in the marketplace as larger banks are not showing the love or paying attention to the middle market during this pandemic. It takes a bank that sees the long view, whose management teams are local and has access to decision-makers and will be there for their customers and their prospects during these difficult times. We are that community bank, and we are looking forward to a record year in 2021. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Sean Burke, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give us some commentary on the operating results for the quarter. Sean?\nSean Burke: Thank you, Kevin. What a difference a year makes. Year-over-year net income and earnings per share were up over 80% with net income for the first quarter totaling $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Our net interest margin dropped eight basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.9% with prepayment fees driving the decline. Our core net interest margin, however, expanded two basis points quarter-over-quarter as we continue to benefit from declining deposit costs. On an encouraging note, we have seen prepayment fees rebound and totaled $4.5 million in the month of April alone and expect our second quarter margin to rebound accordingly. Total noninterest income totaled $20 million, a decrease of $2.7 million on a core basis quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, however, noninterest income increased $5.3 million or 36%, driven by mortgage banking, swap fees and wealth advisory fees. Total noninterest expenses totaled $104 million for the first quarter, a decrease of $38.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by $23 million of costs from the early extinguishment of debt and $12 million of branch closure costs in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, noninterest expenses were down $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by incentive compensation. Provision for credit losses was a negative $3 million for the first quarter compared to a negative $2.7 million release for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by an improving economic forecast and net loan recoveries in the quarter of $2 million. Our total loan balances were flat quarter-over-quarter, while C&I loans grew $66.5 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. Total deposits were down $534 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by the intentional runoff of brokered deposits; while noninterest-bearing deposits were up $174 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 20% at March 31 compared to 13% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continued to remain in a solid position at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.4% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.51% at December 31 while our allowance for loan losses to loans remained unchanged at 1.44%. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13% at quarter end. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Okay. Before I open up to questions, I just want to -- just give a sort of like the longer view. The last 12 months have been an unbelievable year of social unrest and economic turmoil. And when I look back on the last year, I see the bank's leadership team that has grown in confidence and competence as they've executed through this storm as we continue to provide a platform for our employees for personal growth and successful business careers. There is great optimism in the bank and in the communities that we serve. We continue to serve our customers, employees and our communities in partnership with our foundation. It is part of our brand to be the different community bank that makes a difference. This is not a new trend to our bank, it is part of our DNA. And with all the discussions of corporate social responsibility, we are and have been on the front lines in supporting and serving the underserved. Let your sermons be said without words, and our actions speak volumes of who we are and what we have accomplished. Our foundation and bank have donated over $70 million since 2005. And our return to shareholders has been almost 280% since that time. This compares very favorably to local community thrifts here in New Jersey, up 42%; and New Jersey commercial banks, up 58%. And if you compare our return to the national banks during this period, the four largest national banks, we surpassed them 2.5 times with that 280% return for investors versus 78% for the large national banks. We have always taken the long-term view, something that our society or government sometimes has difficulty doing. In the words of my predecessor, Bob Cashill, we understand that we can do good and do well. We recently added two new directors to our corporate Board, and I'd like to welcome Kim Wales and John Harmon to our Board. They both bring a broad range of experience to our team, and we are happy to have them. Their diverse background and experience will make us stronger. With respect to DE&I, we recently held a town hall meeting with Dom and I taking questions on how we can create greater opportunities for our customers, employees, our vendors and the communities that we serve. And we are constantly looking forward to better communications and listening better. God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason. And I'm happy to report that our workforce is 56% women and 41% diverse and our offices are 42% women and 28% diverse. And at the most senior level, the EVP level, it's 24% women and 60% diverse. The journey is the destination, and we are on a journey of continuous improvement, getting better every day. I don't want to be better than Dom, but I want to be better than I was yesterday and getting better and being a servant leader who serves. And our leadership teams continues to be selfless in their service to others. We have accomplished a lot in the past 15 months. We've accomplished a lot in the last 15 years. But we are stronger today and certainly more hopeful. And as I said last year this time, when I was one of five employees at the bank, let's be faithful and not fearful. The future looks bright. There was certainly great hope and optimism in the President's speech last night, and I look forward to a record and great year in 2021. I'd like to now turn it over to questions and open the lines up to hear from you. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.\nJared Shaw: Good morning, guys. Maybe starting off on the funding side, with the runoff of that higher cost funding, your loan-to-deposit ratio is still pretty high. Are you seeing good trends sort of in the DDA growth that should be sustainable and that we should see maybe a faster pace of deposit growth from here? Or how should we be thinking about funding and deposit growth in light of loan growth expectations?\nDomenick Cama: I think that we'll continue to see an increase in our funding on the deposit side. Noninterest-bearing has been a nice surprise for us. This quarter, I think Sean mentioned that we were about $180 million in noninterest-bearing growth. Total deposit growth though was about $350 million in the branches. So I think when you compare that to $1.2 billion in growth in 2020, I think we're on pace to match what we did in 2020.\nJared Shaw: Okay. And then when you look at the loan growth outlook, what category should we see that in? What's your appetite, I guess, for taking on additional New York City CRE at this point? Has pricing improved at all? Or has it gotten tighter, I guess? What does the growth mix outlook look like?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. The way the pipeline is broken out, I mean, the CRE pipeline is about $2.4 billion and the C&I pipeline is just about $900 million. That equates to the $3.3 billion Kevin referred to earlier. We have seen some Manhattan business pick up, especially on the CRE side and on the multifamily side. Things are getting better. They're not where they were pre COVID, but they are getting better. And to the extent that we need some additional risk mitigants in the CRE space, we're doing that. We're doing that in the form of PGs. We're doing that in the form of asking customers to put six months of payments in escrow with us. And yes, so we're pretty comfortable. Fortunately, we do a lot of business in New Jersey also, so New Jersey is contributing nicely to the pipeline. But we're not running away from Manhattan at this point, we're simply being more cautious as we make those loans. When you look at a loan that comes in from Manhattan, the first question you ask is, \"How were you impacted during the COVID crisis?\" And then you work from there.\nJared Shaw: And then just finally for me, we're seeing some deal activity in your markets over the last few weeks. How do you think that impacts your ability, I guess, to potentially hire some people or target some customers that maybe you weren't able to get before? And then what's your outlook in terms of a participant in the M&A environment at this point?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. I think, Jared, from the perspective of competitive forces, I think you're exactly right. I mean, while a number of these institutions are doing their deals and trying to integrate their respective financial institutions, I think there'll be an opportunity for us to bring over additional lending teams or to capture some additional business in our market. I mean we're starting to see a little bit of that already, quite honestly. As far as the deal activity, I mean, clearly, I see, and I think we agree as a management team, that there is a compelling reason to do deals like that in terms of just being bigger, having more funds to contribute to technology investments and just being more diversified. So as far as the institutions that I know personally, those in our area, I congratulate them on the deals. I thought they were good deals for both institutions, and I wish them well.\nKevin Cummings: Yes. Jared, I think the strategic opportunities will always be evaluated here, we've always said that. The core pillars of organic growth, M&A, both as either a buyer or a strategic partnership, dividends and stock buybacks. And certainly, those things are the pillars of our strategy moving forward. There is a lot of chatter, we're talking to a lot of people, a lot of opportunities out there, and I think it's an exciting time. But either way, the long-term view is we're in a very good position. And either way, there are great opportunities ahead of us.\nJared Shaw: Thank you, I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Piper Sandler.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Hey guys, good morning. Kevin, I love the uplifting comments.\nKevin Cummings: Okay, Mark.\nMark Fitzgibbon: First, I wondered if you could give us any update on the timing of the expected closing on the Berkshire Hills branches, when that might be?\nDomenick Cama: We'll probably get that closed before June 30, Mark.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then secondly, on the expense front, you guys did a nice job managing cost this quarter. I wondered if you could, Sean, maybe share with us your outlook for expenses for the next quarter or two.\nSean Burke: I think we should be in a very good spot, Mark, there. We've provided a guide, I believe it was around $425 million, and we're doing a bit better than that. So next quarter, I expect it to be in a similar spot. The Berkshire transaction, when it closes, will add some additional cost when that comes in. But as Domenick mentioned, probably not until sometime in the second quarter. So just looking forward to second quarter, expense is probably in a very similar spot that they are in today.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Okay. And then last, given the increased digitization of the business, are you guys thinking more about being proactive with branch consolidations in the rest of your network?\nDomenick Cama: Yes, we are, Mark. I think we mentioned in earlier releases, we planned on closing 10 branches. We closed those branches earlier this month, as a matter of fact, I think, on April 9. And so I think that we need to continue to evaluate those opportunities. We continue to develop online products, which that technology and that progress has been moving along nicely. And I think that will be a catalyst for us to continue to trim the branch network around the region.\nMark Fitzgibbon: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Duong from RBC Capital Markets.\nSteven Duong: Hey, good morning guys. Sean, I just want to make sure I heard it right. The prepay income through April so far, was that $4.5 million?\nSean Burke: That's correct. $4.5 million in the month of April.\nSteven Duong: Okay. So you're on pace to be above the fourth quarter level then?\nSean Burke: Yes. I wouldn't go that far, Steven. I think the fourth quarter was elevated as far as our guidance for NIM that we gave for the full year, the 3% area. We were modeling in less than where we were in the fourth quarter, candidly. Our budget was $4 million to $5 million of prepayment fees per quarter built into our budget and built into our guidance. But we are seeing a nice rebound there. We do expect the margin to pop back up, maybe eight to 10 basis points in the second quarter.\nKevin Cummings: Usually, it's seasonal in the fourth quarter because of tax reasons, 1031 exchange, whatever it might be, =usually prepayments are highest in the fourth quarter.\nSteven Duong: Right. Right. That makes sense. So I guess maybe we just drill down on just the loan yields. If we were to strip out just the prepaid income, I don't know if my calculation is right, but I'm getting your core loan yield down around 13 basis points. Does that sounds right? So I'm just wondering if you maybe just explain what the dynamics were with the core loan yield ex the prepay income.\nDomenick Cama: Steven, I think the best way to try to answer that question is just to go through kind of the average coupons that we're seeing based on the categories, four major categories. When we look at resi loans these days, resi loans are coming on the balance sheet at just probably around 3%, I'd put them right there. Multifamily is coming on somewhere between 3 1/8%, 3.125% and 3.20%. CRE is coming on at about 3 1/4% to 3 3/8%. And then C&I, as you know, has become more competitive, especially here in this market, and those yields are coming in somewhere between 3 3/8% and 3 3/4%. So obviously, the interest rate environment has benefited us on the liability side, but clearly, it's having an impact on the asset side, too. So I hope that answers your question.\nSean Burke: And Steven, it's Sean. Your math is approximately correct. And just to add on, where we probably saw the most compression is in our residential portfolio. The current market rates are around the 3% area. Our portfolio is yielding, the residential side was yielding higher than that. And so it's kind of coming back down to the norm. So that's probably the spot where we're seeing the most compression.\nSteven Duong: Got it. So I guess, if rates are static, I guess, would you think that we'd just be around this level on the core loan yields?\nSean Burke: Yes. I think that's fair. We took more compression this quarter. And I think moving forward, as we look through the year, we're not expecting to see that much compression on the loan yield side, some but not to the degree that we saw in the first quarter.\nSteven Duong: Got it. Okay. And then just last one for me. Just on your borrowings, I know that you're planning to prepay $250 million concurrent with the Berkshire deal this quarter. But you still have, as of right now, about $3.6 billion of borrowings. What are your thoughts about doing more prepayments, given that they're right now over 200 basis points?\nDomenick Cama: Yes. Steven, we obviously, we're looking at that. As you point out, we have the $3.5 billion or so at over 2%. So there's an opportunity to pick up some NIM thereby, frankly, burning capital by paying the prepayment fees. We'll look at that. We've been talking about doing a larger trade than the one that we projected for the Berkshire transaction. And so just given the Berkshire transaction, we may supersize, if you will, the prepayments using the Berkshire transaction as a catalyst for doing that.\nSteven Duong: Got it, appreciate that. Thank you guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]The next question comes from Michael Perito with KBW.\nMichael Perito: Hey guys, I appreciate taking your time. I was wondering if, first, you can just expand a little bit more on the residential mortgage gain on sale pipeline, sorry, if I missed it. And is it fair to think that that number could bounce back a little in the second quarter before normalizing presumably over the back half of the year?\nDomenick Cama: Are you talking about the income that we generate, the mortgage banking income?\nMichael Perito: Yes, the mortgage gain on sale, correct.\nDomenick Cama: Yes. Mike, we see activity has slowed on the mortgage banking front, and we think that that number will trend down for the next quarter. As a matter of fact, when we did our budgets, we actually projected that, that number would come down in 2021. So I think the answer is yes, that number will continue to trend down as we head through the rest of the year.\nSean Burke: Mike, it's Sean. I just wanted to add though that, as Domenick mentioned, we are expecting that to trend down. But we are expecting swap fee income to offset some of that decline as we go throughout the year. So that's how we see fee income unfolding, where we're going to lose a little on the mortgage banking side, but we're going to pick up and gain an offset with swap income as we go throughout the year.\nMichael Perito: Got it. Thanks for that, and then just lastly, the loan growth, 7% to 9%, pretty strong. How do we balance kind of the provision expense here between the improving economic conditions, but clearly the accelerating loan growth? Do you guys have any kind of initial thoughts on that?\nSean Burke: I think our models were showing, obviously, this quarter, improved economic conditions. We think that can continue to improve if we stay on the current trajectory that we're on. I think the New York City area has been a little slower to improve from a modeling perspective and a forecasting perspective than some other parts of the country. But we do believe it's trending in the right direction. And if we keep on the current path, that will mean maybe when we get toward the back half of the year, there could be more release coming in the provision line item.\nKevin Cummings: I hate to say it, but hopefully, we'll have some loan growth that will offset that release. So we're looking for loan growth, okay?\nMichael Perito: Yes. No. I think that would probably be a scenario everyone would be very happy with. Thank you guys for taking my question, I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Laurie Hunsicker with Compass Point.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes, hi, good morning, can you hear me now?\nDomenick Cama: We can.\nKevin Cummings: Hi, Laurie.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. Sorry, don't know what I did. Of your $582 million in deferrals, how much of that is New York City?\nKevin Cummings: $341 million, I believe.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay. Great. And then will you just remind us, of that, how much is multifamily in New York and how much is office in New York?\nKevin Cummings: One second.\nDomenick Cama: Laurie, are you talking about New York City specifically, right, Manhattan, the Manhattan borough?\nLaurie Hunsicker: Yes, exactly, New York City-specific. And maybe along those lines, too, just of your $1.2 billion in office, how much of that plays into New York City as well? And if you don't have these, I can follow up with you offline.\nKevin Cummings: Yes. We will follow up with the office. In Manhattan, $88 million is multifamily, CRE is $38 million, lodging is $195 million, C&I loans is 0.\nLaurie Hunsicker: C&I is 0. Okay. Great. And the buybacks, love seeing them. Obviously, they were a little slower this quarter. Any comments around that?\nDomenick Cama: I think, Laurie, obviously, we saw our stock price accelerate pretty quickly. So it gave us a reason to pause on our buybacks there and just trying to understand how tangible book value would compare to where we're trading on a book value basis. So we'll continue to evaluate that. The stock got up there around $15. So as I said, it just gave us reason to pause and just monitor how stable that would be going forward.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Got it. Okay. And then just last question, going back to what Jared asked, too, can you help us think a little bit about M&A? Obviously, it's been a year since we saw you close your last deal. Can you help us think about, as you look forward, whether it's a strategic partnership or you're a buyer or you're on the other side of it, how you think about asset size targets? What makes sense? What's ideal? How big would you go? How do you think about an MOE? How do all those things play into the very exciting M&A landscape we're seeing at the moment? Thanks.\nKevin Cummings: Laurie, I would say yes. Certainly, we're open to any strategic discussions from an MOE. I mean, Berkshire is a $600 million deposit branch acquisition. So if it fits in with the strategy, if you look at the last two transactions, Berkshire is on one side of our franchise, Gold Coast was on the east side of our franchise. And I think we closed the Berkshire deal on April 3, a year ago. In the height of the pandemic, we had get to out there and change all the signage. We were worrying about the police shutting us down from being outside during that period of time. And both those transactions are very promising to us. They're a little on the small size, takes a lot of energy. I think that $7 billion to $15 billion area would be a great lock-on-type transaction to do. But we're open, and we'll do whatever is necessary to enhance the shareholder value of the company. There are a lot of discussions going on, and we are certainly looking at a lot of opportunities in the marketplace.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Right. Thanks for taking my questions.\nKevin Cummings: Laurie, just on the numbers, I had said them earlier. The total exposure in Manhattan is $367 million, of which the hotel sector is $196 million; multifamily and CRE are $88 million and $38 million, respectively. And as I mentioned earlier, pretty good sponsorship and improving operations. And they're all paying us interest, too. I want to emphasize that. There's no principal and interest deferral, they're all paying us interest.\nLaurie Hunsicker: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Breese with Stephens.\nMatthew Breese: Good morning.\nKevin Cummings: Hey, Matthew.\nDomenick Cama: Good morning, Matthew.\nMatthew Breese: I know we hit on a lot of the moving pieces, but maybe more directly talking about the core NIM, so ex prepayment penalty income, how do you think the year kind of unfolds for that metric and the cadence of expansion from here?\nDomenick Cama: Matt, I think that we'll continue to see benefits from falling rates, especially in our deposit portfolio. Like for example, we still have some room to go in our government banking portfolio. We're working on that. We still have a number of CD buckets in that are maturing through the year and we'll see some benefit from that. So I think the core NIM will continue to expand. I know there was a lot of focus on the overall NIM and prepayment fees. But we just look at that as being seasonal. But I think you're right, focusing on the core NIM is reflective of the changes that we're making in our balance sheet, where resi and multi are falling and C&I and CRE are going up and noninterest-bearing deposits have hit 20%. So I think we'll continue to see benefit in the core NIM.\nMatthew Breese: Got it. Okay. The other question I had was there's two pieces of legislation. In the State of New York, they're talking about this eviction without good cause. That's in committee. It seems like it would impact market rate apartments, and then it seems that President Biden is talking about the 1031 exchange. How do you kind of view these pieces of legislation impacting commercial real estate and multifamily? And how would you kind of assess the loan growth impact potential and credit quality impact potential?\nKevin Cummings: Matt, I think you have to look at it in light of the whole Democratic agenda, capital gains tax, things like that, it's not going to be good for business. So it's certainly not good for economic development, for productivity. It seems like everything is going to be free. And so I certainly don't think it's good for investment in the country. I have a tendency to listen to Fox Business a little too much. And I certainly think that it's certainly going to have a negative impact on business and business investment going forward. But I think getting it through and putting it in operation, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you, and commercial real estate, especially in the multifamily sector, is a very strong sector and pays a lot of taxes. And they shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them as far as generating tax revenues in the city and the state.\nMatthew Breese: Got it, that's all I have. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.\nKevin Cummings: Well, thank you for your participation today. I look forward to seeing you all at our shareholders' meeting in May. It will be a virtual meeting again. And I think 2021 is going to be a very strong year for the company, we've had three quarters of double-digit return on equity. And it's probably a record for the company in the last nine months, and I think it will continue throughout 2021. So thank you for your participation today. Have a great day, and enjoy your spring. Be well.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

This quarter, I think Sean mentioned that we were about $180 million in noninterest-bearing growth. Total deposit growth though was about $350 million in the branches. So I think when you compare that to $1.2 billion in growth in 2020, I think we're on pace to match what we did in 2020. Yes.

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. What a difference a year makes. Year-over-year net income and earnings per share were up over 80% with net income for the first quarter totaling $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Our net interest margin dropped eight basis points quarter-over-quarter to 2.9% with prepayment fees driving the decline. Our core net interest margin, however, expanded two basis points quarter-over-quarter as we continue to benefit from declining deposit costs. On an encouraging note, we have seen prepayment fees rebound and totaled $4.5 million in the month of April alone and expect our second quarter margin to rebound accordingly. Total noninterest income totaled $20 million, a decrease of $2.7 million on a core basis quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, however, noninterest income increased $5.3 million or 36%, driven by mortgage banking, swap fees and wealth advisory fees. Total noninterest expenses totaled $104 million for the first quarter, a decrease of $38.5 million quarter-over-quarter. The decrease was driven by $23 million of costs from the early extinguishment of debt and $12 million of branch closure costs in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, noninterest expenses were down $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by incentive compensation. Provision for credit losses was a negative $3 million for the first quarter compared to a negative $2.7 million release for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by an improving economic forecast and net loan recoveries in the quarter of $2 million. Our total loan balances were flat quarter-over-quarter, while C&I loans grew $66.5 million or 2% quarter-over-quarter. Total deposits were down $534 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by the intentional runoff of brokered deposits; while noninterest-bearing deposits were up $174 million or 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits to total deposits improved to 20% at March 31 compared to 13% a year ago. Asset quality, liquidity and capital continued to remain in a solid position at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans represented 0.4% of total loans at March 31 compared to 0.51% at December 31 while our allowance for loan losses to loans remained unchanged at 1.44%. Our common equity Tier one ratio was 13% at quarter end. Now I'd like to turn it back over to Kevin for concluding remarks. I think we should be in a very good spot, Mark, there. We've provided a guide, I believe it was around $425 million, and we're doing a bit better than that. So next quarter, I expect it to be in a similar spot. The Berkshire transaction, when it closes, will add some additional cost when that comes in. But as Domenick mentioned, probably not until sometime in the second quarter. So just looking forward to second quarter, expense is probably in a very similar spot that they are in today. That's correct. $4.5 million in the month of April. Yes. I wouldn't go that far, Steven. I think the fourth quarter was elevated as far as our guidance for NIM that we gave for the full year, the 3% area. We were modeling in less than where we were in the fourth quarter, candidly. Our budget was $4 million to $5 million of prepayment fees per quarter built into our budget and built into our guidance. But we are seeing a nice rebound there. We do expect the margin to pop back up, maybe eight to 10 basis points in the second quarter. And Steven, it's Sean. Your math is approximately correct. And just to add on, where we probably saw the most compression is in our residential portfolio. The current market rates are around the 3% area. Our portfolio is yielding, the residential side was yielding higher than that. And so it's kind of coming back down to the norm. So that's probably the spot where we're seeing the most compression. Yes. I think that's fair. We took more compression this quarter. And I think moving forward, as we look through the year, we're not expecting to see that much compression on the loan yield side, some but not to the degree that we saw in the first quarter. Mike, it's Sean. I just wanted to add though that, as Domenick mentioned, we are expecting that to trend down. But we are expecting swap fee income to offset some of that decline as we go throughout the year. So that's how we see fee income unfolding, where we're going to lose a little on the mortgage banking side, but we're going to pick up and gain an offset with swap income as we go throughout the year. I think our models were showing, obviously, this quarter, improved economic conditions. We think that can continue to improve if we stay on the current trajectory that we're on. I think the New York City area has been a little slower to improve from a modeling perspective and a forecasting perspective than some other parts of the country. But we do believe it's trending in the right direction. And if we keep on the current path, that will mean maybe when we get toward the back half of the year, there could be more release coming in the provision line item."

            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, and welcome to the Investors Bancorp First Quarter Earnings Call for 2021. Last night, the company reported in its press release, net income of $72.3 million or $0.31 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. This compares to $75.1 million or $0.32 per diluted share for the quarter ended December 30 last year and $39.5 million or $0.17 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The fourth quarter of last year, we recorded some noncore transactions that impacted results and improved earnings to $84 million or $0.35 per share. The difference in core operating results of approximately $9 million for the fourth quarter were due to a $6.9 million reduction in prepayment fees, which are included in interest income. This decrease in fees caused a reduction in our net interest margin of eight basis points. Excluding these penalties or these penalty fees, our core margin increased by two basis points. The quarter was also impacted by a reduction in gain on sale of loans in mortgage banking activities of $1.7 million and a more favorable tax rate due to R&D credits recognized in the fourth quarter. These decreases in revenues were offset by cost control by reduced core operating expenses of $2.7 million in the first quarter. All things considered, it was a solid quarter for the bank and a good start to 2021. This time last year, there were major concerns about liquidity, capital and where the credit cycle was going to go. And I'm happy to report that the company declared its cash dividend of $0.14 per share to be paid in May, and this reflects a $0.02 increase from the dividend paid at the height of the pandemic last May of 2020. These results reflect our third straight quarter of double-digit return on tangible equity, and our return on average assets has averaged over 1.07% over that 3-quarter period. When I look back to where we were a year ago, it is remarkable what we have accomplished through this pandemic. A year ago, we were in the midst of the PPP process. Customers and our employees were in fear of touching doorknobs or speaking with each other. There was uncertainty and no one felt comfortable with the normal routines of everyday life. Through grit and determination, we were able to take care of our customers, keep all our retail branches open, and most importantly, protect our employees. Today, we are a stronger bank. Our capital ratios are up approximately 30 basis points. Our credit culture is stronger than ever. And our outlook for 2021 is bright. We are anxious to get all our corporate employees back to the office and look forward to being that bank that serves our customers and communities in both good times and times of crisis. On the credit front, our nonaccrual loans are down $23.8 million or 22% for the fourth quarter and $48.7 million or 37% from September 30 of last year. This reduction in nonaccrual loans was completed with no cumulative net charge-offs as our net charge-offs in the last six months were negative and resulted in net recoveries of $5.7 million for the last two quarters. Our loan loss coverage ratio to nonaccrual loans is 341% this quarter versus 248% last year at March 31. In the commercial portfolio, our total nonaccrual loans of $37.6 million, consisting of 53 loans for an average loan of approximately $709,000, which is down from $79.8 million at September 30 of last year. Our three largest nonaccrual loans at March 31 are: a multifamily loan for $4.6 million, a CRE loan for $3.1 million and a business loan for $2.6 million. The remaining 50 loans in the nonaccrual group reflect an average exposure of $550,000 and is similar to the exposure in our mortgage and consumer portfolio, which has an average loan, nonaccrual, of $191,000. We have a war room mentality with respect to credit but still believe we have a lot of work to do to get through this operating environment and the post effects of the pandemic. Almost every week since June, we have met to discuss our loan exposures and trends in deferred loans due to this pandemic. At March 31, our total deferrals were down to $582 million and include approximately $500 million in loans that are currently paying us interest and are keeping their taxes current. We have made a concerted effort to reach out to our customers during this time to work with them through the crisis. And in a period of uncertainty, we see these times as an opportunity to help our customers and build long-term relationships. With respect to principal and interest deferrals, we have approximately $83 million, of which $23 million in the entertainment category commenced payments as of April 1. The remaining $60 million is made up of 20 loans. And the two largest loans are both multifamily loans for $37 million and $10 million. So of the remaining $50 million -- $60 million, the remaining $60 million, $37 million and $10 million are in two loans. We have recently visited those two properties earlier this month. And the Washington loan -- one loan is in Washington, D.C. with an average loan per unit of approximately $70,000. The complex was recording stronger cash collections in March that we collected at pro forma cash flow of a 1.2% debt service. It is a well-maintained property and should retain its value, and we expect it to be back to full payment at the end of the deferral period. The other loan is in Brooklyn, which we visited earlier this month, and is a 20-unit relatively new building that is fully occupied and is recovering its cash flows after concessions to new apartment dwellers and should not be a problem due to the strong sponsorship, the quality of the building and its amenities. The remaining exposure in this principal and interest deferral is $13 million, which is made up of 18 loans for an average loan of approximately $722,000. So at the end of the day, we feel we have a great handle on the exposure of this $60 million of principal and interest deferral. There's a lot of discussion of what's going on in Manhattan. And in that deferral portfolio, our Manhattan exposure is mainly in the hotel sector for $196 million of the total $367 million that we have in the Manhattan area. All of the loans in the hotel sector and in Manhattan are paying interest and are showing improving trends. The hotels are seeing increased tourist activity but little business travel. These properties are family businesses for multi-generations and have strong sponsorship. The remaining exposure in Manhattan is in multifamily and CRE for $88 million and $38 million, respectively, and have good sponsorship and improving operations and do not show any major issues at this time. As I mentioned earlier, our credit and first-line teams have been meeting on a weekly basis to discuss the progress of the deferral portfolio and other trends in the total commercial portfolio. Last week, we met for several hours to discuss our office portfolio, where we reviewed the top 25 loans for approximately $620 million. All of these loans are current as to interest and principal and there was nothing discussed that would set off alarm bells at this time. We will continue to monitor this and other portfolios at the highest level of management to make sure we stay ahead of the leasing activities in both retail and office and the impact of changes in business practices and workplace activities. Today, we feel we are doing everything possible to manage this credit risk with strong reserves, low delinquency trends and a strong credit and monitoring team in place to manage us through this pandemic. With respect to loan growth, our commercial loans grew 1.3% in the quarter compared to a reduction in loans of 1.4% in the 2020 first quarter. The first quarter is usually a slower quarter for us, and we are optimistic of the activity we are seeing in the marketplace. Our lending teams are engaged and are making calls in the market. They're out in the market, out of the office. We have a strong commercial pipeline, which totals over $3.3 billion and compares to $1.5 billion last year this time and $2.2 billion at year-end. We believe we can grow our loans at a 7% to 8%, maybe 9% pace for 2021. On the deposit front, deposits were down $534 million, which related to planned runoff of higher-costing brokered deposits of $534 million and government deposits of $327 million as our cost of deposits went down 19 basis points for the quarter. Our consumer and business deposits were up $328 million with our noninterest deposits increasing $174 million or 4.8% for the quarter. Noninterest deposits now comprise 20% of deposits, which is a first for the company. We are seeing great activity from the investments we have made in 2019 and 2020 with our business lenders and business development teams generating core deposits and relationships and business loans. We are moving forward with our Berkshire acquisition, which will bring approximately $300 million in loans and $600 million in deposits. We recently agreed to a marketing partnership with the Trenton Thunder, a local Minor League Baseball team in Trenton in the Berkshire market and have been active in coordinating activities with the retail and business teams in that market. It is a great opportunity for us. And we will expand our brand with two additional branches in Bucks County in Pennsylvania. Going into the year 2021, we have strong momentum and continue to see great opportunities in the marketplace as larger banks are not showing the love or paying attention to the middle market during this pandemic. It takes a bank that sees the long view, whose management teams are local and has access to decision-makers and will be there for their customers and their prospects during these difficult times. We are that community bank, and we are looking forward to a record year in 2021. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Sean Burke, our Chief Financial Officer, who will give us some commentary on the operating results for the quarter. Sean? Okay. Before I open up to questions, I just want to -- just give a sort of like the longer view. The last 12 months have been an unbelievable year of social unrest and economic turmoil. And when I look back on the last year, I see the bank's leadership team that has grown in confidence and competence as they've executed through this storm as we continue to provide a platform for our employees for personal growth and successful business careers. There is great optimism in the bank and in the communities that we serve. We continue to serve our customers, employees and our communities in partnership with our foundation. It is part of our brand to be the different community bank that makes a difference. This is not a new trend to our bank, it is part of our DNA. And with all the discussions of corporate social responsibility, we are and have been on the front lines in supporting and serving the underserved. Let your sermons be said without words, and our actions speak volumes of who we are and what we have accomplished. Our foundation and bank have donated over $70 million since 2005. And our return to shareholders has been almost 280% since that time. This compares very favorably to local community thrifts here in New Jersey, up 42%; and New Jersey commercial banks, up 58%. And if you compare our return to the national banks during this period, the four largest national banks, we surpassed them 2.5 times with that 280% return for investors versus 78% for the large national banks. We have always taken the long-term view, something that our society or government sometimes has difficulty doing. In the words of my predecessor, Bob Cashill, we understand that we can do good and do well. We recently added two new directors to our corporate Board, and I'd like to welcome Kim Wales and John Harmon to our Board. They both bring a broad range of experience to our team, and we are happy to have them. Their diverse background and experience will make us stronger. With respect to DE&I, we recently held a town hall meeting with Dom and I taking questions on how we can create greater opportunities for our customers, employees, our vendors and the communities that we serve. And we are constantly looking forward to better communications and listening better. God gave you two ears and one mouth for a reason. And I'm happy to report that our workforce is 56% women and 41% diverse and our offices are 42% women and 28% diverse. And at the most senior level, the EVP level, it's 24% women and 60% diverse. The journey is the destination, and we are on a journey of continuous improvement, getting better every day. I don't want to be better than Dom, but I want to be better than I was yesterday and getting better and being a servant leader who serves. And our leadership teams continues to be selfless in their service to others. We have accomplished a lot in the past 15 months. We've accomplished a lot in the last 15 years. But we are stronger today and certainly more hopeful. And as I said last year this time, when I was one of five employees at the bank, let's be faithful and not fearful. The future looks bright. There was certainly great hope and optimism in the President's speech last night, and I look forward to a record and great year in 2021. I'd like to now turn it over to questions and open the lines up to hear from you. Thank you. Yes. Jared, I think the strategic opportunities will always be evaluated here, we've always said that. The core pillars of organic growth, M&A, both as either a buyer or a strategic partnership, dividends and stock buybacks. And certainly, those things are the pillars of our strategy moving forward. There is a lot of chatter, we're talking to a lot of people, a lot of opportunities out there, and I think it's an exciting time. But either way, the long-term view is we're in a very good position. And either way, there are great opportunities ahead of us. Okay, Mark. Usually, it's seasonal in the fourth quarter because of tax reasons, 1031 exchange, whatever it might be, =usually prepayments are highest in the fourth quarter. I hate to say it, but hopefully, we'll have some loan growth that will offset that release. So we're looking for loan growth, okay? Hi, Laurie. $341 million, I believe. One second. Yes. We will follow up with the office. In Manhattan, $88 million is multifamily, CRE is $38 million, lodging is $195 million, C&I loans is 0. Laurie, I would say yes. Certainly, we're open to any strategic discussions from an MOE. I mean, Berkshire is a $600 million deposit branch acquisition. So if it fits in with the strategy, if you look at the last two transactions, Berkshire is on one side of our franchise, Gold Coast was on the east side of our franchise. And I think we closed the Berkshire deal on April 3, a year ago. In the height of the pandemic, we had get to out there and change all the signage. We were worrying about the police shutting us down from being outside during that period of time. And both those transactions are very promising to us. They're a little on the small size, takes a lot of energy. I think that $7 billion to $15 billion area would be a great lock-on-type transaction to do. But we're open, and we'll do whatever is necessary to enhance the shareholder value of the company. There are a lot of discussions going on, and we are certainly looking at a lot of opportunities in the marketplace. Laurie, just on the numbers, I had said them earlier. The total exposure in Manhattan is $367 million, of which the hotel sector is $196 million; multifamily and CRE are $88 million and $38 million, respectively. And as I mentioned earlier, pretty good sponsorship and improving operations. And they're all paying us interest, too. I want to emphasize that. There's no principal and interest deferral, they're all paying us interest. Hey, Matthew. Matt, I think you have to look at it in light of the whole Democratic agenda, capital gains tax, things like that, it's not going to be good for business. So it's certainly not good for economic development, for productivity. It seems like everything is going to be free. And so I certainly don't think it's good for investment in the country. I have a tendency to listen to Fox Business a little too much. And I certainly think that it's certainly going to have a negative impact on business and business investment going forward. But I think getting it through and putting it in operation, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you, and commercial real estate, especially in the multifamily sector, is a very strong sector and pays a lot of taxes. And they shouldn't bite the hand that feeds them as far as generating tax revenues in the city and the state. Well, thank you for your participation today. I look forward to seeing you all at our shareholders' meeting in May. It will be a virtual meeting again. And I think 2021 is going to be a very strong year for the company, we've had three quarters of double-digit return on equity. And it's probably a record for the company in the last nine months, and I think it will continue throughout 2021. So thank you for your participation today. Have a great day, and enjoy your spring. Be well."

My name is Keeley, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full-year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.  Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We are also referencing non-GAAP financial measures. So it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Kristin. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full-year and we feel well positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in 2023. We are playing strong defense with a robust balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. At the same time, we continue to play disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. We are focused on building out a prudent, sustainable growth trajectory over the medium-term. I'll comment briefly on the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying EPS was $1.32, our return on tangible common equity was 19.4% and the efficiency ratio was 54%. Sequential operating leverage was 1% and sequential PPNR growth was 2.6%. Leading our performance was 2% sequential NII growth, reflecting NIM expansion of 5 basis points to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given the impact of a $900 million reduction in our auto portfolio. Growth was 1% ex this impact. Deposits were solid with 1% sequential growth, and our LDR remained stable at 87%. Our fee businesses showed resilience and diversity given a challenging environment, down about 1% sequentially. A number of M&A fees pushed into Q1 and mortgage results were softer than expected. We maintained stable expenses in the quarter, and credit metrics remain good. We boosted our allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of loans, which compares with pro forma day 1 CECL levels of 1.30%. We restarted our share repurchase activity in Q4, buying $150 million of stock and we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10% at the top of our targeted range. For full-year 2022, we delivered underlying EPS of $4.84 and ROTCE of 16.4% as we captured the benefit of rising rates and our strengthened deposit base. The results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide, which we included in the appendix of the presentation. With respect to our guidance for 2023, we assume a slowdown in economic growth to 1% for the year, two early Fed rate hikes and a Q4 cut and inflation getting below 3% by Q4. We project moderate loan growth, partially offset by continued run off in our auto book of close to $3 billion. Overall, we see solid NII growth as NIM gradually rises to 3.4% over the year, a roughly 8% growth in fees to kind of rebound in capital markets fees over the course of the year, solid expense discipline with core expense growth ex acquisition and FDIC impacts of 3.5% to 4%.  We announced today our TOP 8 program, which targets $100 million in run rate benefits and about 80% of that is expense impact. Credit should be manageable with net charge-offs in the 30 to 35 basis point range and we expect to build our ACL to 1.45% to 1.5% of loans. We expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given strong profitability, modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions with our CET1 ratio forecast near the high end of our 9.5% to 10% range. Capital return to shareholders should approach 100% and yield to investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase put TOP 12%. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2022, and we feel we are well positioned in 2023 to continue our journey towards becoming a top-performing bank. We continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer, commercial and the enterprise. We've transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits. We've adjusted our interest hedging to protect against lower rates through 2025. Given the improvement in our ROTCE over time, we are raising our medium-term target to 16% to 18% from 14% to 16%. We've stayed focused on positive operating leverage. We've captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment, and we still have plenty of upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve. Exciting times for Citizens. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2022. We know we can count on you again in the new year. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Big picture, 2022 was a strong year for Citizens with significant delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Most notably, we closed our acquisitions of HSBC and ISBC. We captured the benefit of higher rates with strong NII and NIM, and our balance sheet and interest rate position were well managed.  While fee revenues were impacted by the environment, we are very well positioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when markets normalize, particularly in capital markets. Mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time, and we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments. We are actively managing our loan portfolio, focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business into 2023 and beyond. We continue to maintain good expense discipline, delivering in excess of $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefit through TOP 7, generating 4.7% underlying positive operating leverage for the year and 16.4% full-year ROTCE. Let me give you the headlines for the financial results, referencing slide five. For the fourth quarter, we reported underlying net income of $685 million and EPS of $1.32. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 19.4%. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter with 5 basis points of margin expansion to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio. Period ended average loans are broadly stable linked quarter, up 1%, excluding auto runoff. We grew deposits up 1% linked quarter and our LDR was stable at 87%. Fees showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 1% linked quarter. We saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven by underwriting and M&A, but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a CDA DDA impact in our FX and IRP business. Expenses were broadly stable linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 1% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.4%. Our credit metrics were good, with NCOs of 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $132 million and a reserve build of $44 million this quarter. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, up from 1.41% at the end of the third quarter and approximately 13 basis points above our pro forma day 1 CECL adoption coverage ratio. Our tangible book value per share is up 5% linked quarter. Next, I'll provide further details related to the fourth quarter results. On slide six, net interest income was up 2% given higher net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.3% was up 5 basis points. As you can see on the NIM walk on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. With Fed funds increasing 425 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 29% through the end of the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide seven. We posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 1% linked quarter with lower mortgage and FX and derivatives fees, partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees. Focusing on capital markets. Market volatility continued through the quarter. However, underwriting and M&A advisory fees picked up. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline, including several deals that were pushed into Q1. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production volumes. We have seen pressure on volumes moderating and size of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time. Servicing operating fees were stable. Card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter.  On slide eight, expenses were well controlled, broadly stable linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program delivered over $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. We are excited to announce the launch of our new TOP 8 program, and I'll cover that in a few slides. On slide nine, average and period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter but up 1% ex auto runoff with 1% growth in commercial, reflecting demand in asset-backed financing and growth in CRE, primarily reflecting line draws and slower paydowns. We have seen commercial utilization moderate a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of a softer economy. Average retail loans are down slightly, but up 1% ex planned runoff in auto, given growth in mortgage and home equity, which bring an opportunity for deeper relationships and better risk-adjusted returns. On slide 10, average deposits were up $1.4 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth primarily coming from term deposits, money market accounts and Citizens Access Savings. Overall, commercial banking deposits were up 2.4% and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 67 basis points, which translates to a 29% cumulative beta, broadly consistent with our expectations. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We achieved overall deposit growth this quarter, and we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. Overall liquidity remains strong as we reduced our FHLB advances by $1.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Our period-end LDR improved slightly to 86.7%. Moving on to slide 11. We saw a good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter, which is still low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans are 60 basis points of total loans, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, given an increase in commercial, largely in CRE. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumers vary. Although personal disposable income remains strong, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased. Turning to slide 12, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. While our current credit metrics are good, we increased our allowance by $44 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.43%, which is a modest increase from the third quarter. The current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation, supply chain issues, higher interest rates and return to office trends. Given these pressures, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. Back on slide 32 in the appendix, we have provided some additional information about the CRE portfolio. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 1.86% includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio while the multifamily portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement. The $6.3 billion office portfolio includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back-to-office trends. The remaining $4 billion relates to the general office segment for which we are holding a roughly 5% allowance coverage. About 95% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas. Moving to slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our range. Tangible book value per share was up 5% in the quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.3%. We returned a total of $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our strong capital position, combined with our earnings outlook, puts us in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases. Shifting gears, a bit. Starting on slide 14, we'll cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive outperformance over the next few years. We have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think have big potential and where we have a right to win. So, in Consumer, we've got four big opportunities. First is our push into New York Metro. We are investing in brand marketing, doing well in the technology conversions and putting our best people against the market opportunity. We are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the HSBC branches driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The full ISBC conversion is just around the corner on President's weekend, and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product line-up and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market. You will see more details on slide 28 and 29 in the appendix. Importantly, we achieved about 70% in run rate of our planned $130 million of investors' net expense synergies as of the end of the year and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. Moving to wealth. We've launched a number of exciting initiatives with Citizens Private Client and CitizensPlus as we orient the business towards financial planning led advice. These should really help us penetrate the opportunity with our existing customer base. On slide 15, our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved that to a cloud-based platform, and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass affluent market segment. Where we might have only had a lending or deposit relationship before, our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers in a comprehensive way. And we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. Citizens Pay, for example, is an area where we have significant running room. We've attracted many new partners, up about 150 versus a year ago, which should really ramp the business. And we built an industry-leading home equity business, powered by our innovative fast line process, which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital innovations that have drastically reduced originations time. Moving to the Commercial Bank on slide 16 and 17. We filled in all the product gaps. Acquisitions brought us M&A and other advisory capabilities, and we built out debt capital market capabilities organically. We've hired some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high-growth regions around the country and the right industry verticals to serve larger companies. We also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well positioned to support private equity capital. Bottom line, we have aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues. Moving to slide 18. We are excited to announce the launch of our latest TOP program. Even as we push forward on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 7 program achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $115 million at the end of 2022. And we've launched TOP 8 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2023, with that split about 80-20 between efficiency and revenue-oriented initiatives. Moving to slide 19. I'll walk through the outlook for the full-year, which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end of December forward curve view of two 25 basis point Fed hikes before an expected 25 basis point cut in the fourth quarter. We expect solid NII growth, up 11% to 14%, and we project our NIM to gradually rise towards approximately 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our overall hedge position is expected to provide a NIM floor of about 3.2% through the fourth quarter of 2024 and a gradual 200 basis point decline across the curve, commencing in Q4 2023. In the fourth quarter, we took actions to transition $3 billion of active swaps from 2023 to forward-starting positions in 2024. And we've done even more so far in January to rebalance the distribution of down rate protection. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide 30. We expect moderate loan growth with average loans up 4% to 5%. We are targeting about $3 billion of spot auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect total average earning assets to be up 3% to 4%. On the deposit side, we see 3% average deposit growth and a 2% to 3% spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at year-end reaching the high 30s. These are expected to be up 7% to 9% with a capital markets rebound building over the course of the year. Noninterest expense is expected to be up roughly 7% or about 3.5% to 4% if you adjust for the full-year effect of the HSBC and investors acquisitions and the FDIC premium increase. If the year unfolds as we expect, we should be able to drive about 400 basis points to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Given current macro trends and portfolio originations, we expect that our ACL ratio will rise to the 1.45% to 1.5% level, depending upon how the economy fares. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%, even with our target payout ratio approaching 100%. All of this translates into a ROTCE in the high teens for 2023. On slide 20, we provide the guide for Q1. Note that Q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. Moving to slide 21. As Bruce mentioned, we have completely transformed the franchise since the IPO, executing well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets, and we are ready to raise the bar, lifting our ROTCE target of 16% to 18%. The key to the further ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. As we look out over the medium term, we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth and we will continue to be balance -- continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully. And even if rates come down a bit, we expect NII to benefit from the protection we have put on through the swap portfolio. You should expect us to stay disciplined on expenses. Credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens. And we continue to focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect our CET1 ratio to remain within our target range of 9.5% to 10%. To sum up, slide 22, we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, and we have a positive outlook for 2023. We are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in 2023 with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position. We've taken actions to protect our NIM and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are moving forward executing against our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and outperformance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun : Okay. Thank you, John. And operator, why don't we open it up for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : It sounds like you guys rebalanced some of the hedges in the fourth quarter and are continuing to do so year-to-date so far. I was hoping you might please just expand upon how you're thinking on how those changed since last quarter and sort of how you intend to position yourself?\nJohn Woods : Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. I mean on the big picture, we -- asset sensitivity last quarter was around 3%. We're a little bit below that this quarter just given the way the outlook for the balance sheet appears to be playing out in 2023. So as we're -- as you've seen over time, we've taken our asset sensitivity down. We are -- most of that asset sensitivity is really driven by the short end of the curve, which we expect to remain elevated throughout 2023. And as a result, we're looking at some of the down rate protection that we had in place in 2023 and just repositioning that out of spot-starting active swaps into forward-starting swaps into 2024 and beyond. So we're looking to looking to basically push that out and basically get that down rate protection smoothed out into the '24 and '25 periods rather than holding on to all of that down rate protection here in '23. That's the main objective in what we were doing in the fourth quarter, and we've done a little bit more of that in early 1Q. And then more broadly, we're looking at net interest margin, that corridor, if you will, we're trying to protect that corridor with -- at the low end, if rates were to fall by 200 basis points out in 2024, that you'll see a floor of around 320. So you see that 320 to 340 corridor being something that over time is more narrow than you would have seen from us maybe in past cycles. So that's the main objective.\nBruce Van Saun : And I would just add to that, Scott, in our view in the macro is that the Fed likely moves maybe most or twice the forward curve as they'll move up 25 basis points a couple of times and then stop. And then typically, they would pause for six or seven months before they would cut. And so if there's a cut happening, it likely happens very late in the year and maybe it could be early next year. So guided by that view, that's kind of why we're pushing out that downside protection a bit.\nScott Siefers : Terrific. And then just a separate question. It looks like fees will need to rebound fairly meaningfully following the first quarter to hit the guide? I know, Bruce, you had mentioned an expectation for improved capital markets through the year. Maybe just a thought or two on how you see the main drivers of that fee guide as the year progresses, please? \nBruce Van Saun: Sure. So, I think really, you put your finger on it there, Scott, is the capital markets business. We've had really strong pipelines this year. But because of the volatility because of the fact that the Fed is still moving higher, that's created uncertainty and just an inability to actually get the money to work from private equity or some of the deals done because the financing hasn't been there the way it's been in the past. And so I think as you -- going back to that macro forecast as the Fed is likely nearing kind of the destination in terms of peak rates. I think that starts to loosen up the markets, the financing markets, you'll see less volatility and a lot of the business is kind of clocked into our pipeline will start to print and get delivered, and we'll start to see more transactions. So just by reference, most of the quarters this year, our capital markets revenues were at $90 million to $100 million. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $184 million of fees, so roughly double that level. So we thought coming into this year that we'd have much stronger levels of revenue generation. But the good news is we still have a great overall focus on the right sectors in the market. We've got a great team. And so, I think you'll see that start to rev up as we see the market conditions improve. Beyond that, I'm also quite optimistic. We've made a lot of investments in the wealth business. And again, there, if you start to see some stability in the asset markets, we should get a kind of tailwind from that plus the investments that we've made. So, feel confident about that. And then I'd say mortgage is so washed out. I keep thinking it can't go any lower, and it did in the fourth quarter. But I think you're starting to see people exit the business and coming out of the business. And so you'll start to see margins expand, and I think volumes will tick-up as we go through the year, again, linked back to the Fed reaching the destination and some stability on rates. So those would be the big things. I'm happy to pass the horn here. Don, do you want to say anything else...?\nDon McCree: Yes. I think you've pretty much covered it on cap markets. I said this last quarter, I'll just remind people, again, we are a middle market investment bank. So we're not dependent on these giant transactions that need $5 billion of financing. We do singles and doubles all day long, and our pipelines are reasonably strong with a very heavy content of private equity who is a watch with cash. So, there will be transactions. If you don't get regular way transactions, you're going to get a lot of restructuring transactions. So, there's minority capital. There's a lot of different ways to skin the cat. So, we're relatively optimistic about what's ahead of us in the coming year. \nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Brandon, anything\u2026?\nBrendan Coughlin : I think you nailed that pretty well. I'd say well for the year, we're projecting slow and steady, continued progress, and it's a bit of a hopeful coiled spring when the equity markets really come back. But as long as they're stable, we should see some growth. I'd say the other bright spot is debt and ATM fees that continue to hit records both through customer engagement and primacy and all the investments we made in the health of the franchise that's also translating into our deposit quality, also some restructure on vendor relations and such that's giving us a bit of a boost there, too. So that should be a continued area of slow and steady progress. On the other side, there will continue to be a little bit of pressure still on overdraft income and service charges, but we're sort of near the -- that's in the run rate. Most of that's in the run rate. So we're sort of near the bottom, which is good that we'll move away from being a headwind for us, real soon.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. \nPeter Winter : I wanted to ask on credit. John, you mentioned that most of the increase in nonperforming loans was commercial real estate. I was just wondering, was that office related? And if you can just give a little bit more color on what your outlook is for office?\nJohn Woods : Yes. Maybe I'll just talk about the coverage levels. Just broadly, as you may have seen in our materials that the CRE coverage from an allowance standpoint is around 186 basis points. But when you carve out some of the really high-quality stuff in multifamily and credit tenant lease and life sciences, you get to our general office segment, where we have very healthy coverage of around 5%. So there are some -- we are seeing some trends there that are telling us that we should be putting away some reserves to deal with the back-to-office trends that are a headwind in that space. So, you got good healthy coverage of around 5%. We are seeing some of that tick into the nonaccrual space. I would say more broadly, that will -- even though that goes into nonaccrual, our overall pre-LTVs are typically around 60%. And so, you got to distinguish from non-accruals for actual loss content. And so even though we're putting some allowance away, we feel like that's commensurate with the loss content that we see in the book. And I'll just stop there and\u2026\nBruce Van Saun : Hey, Don, do you want to add?\nDon McCree : I'll just say for the office portfolio, but CRE in general, it's first and foremost, who's the sponsor and who's the investor, and we have a very high-quality group of investors that we do business with, which are largely institutional. Second is what MSAs are you in and where are you? And we think suburban will do better than urban. As we said in the comments, we're heavily weighted to suburban. So, we're going through every single property in the office portfolio. We'll restructure a lot of them with the sponsors. We restructured one already this year where the sponsor-contributed equity. So, we're comfortable around where we are with the coverage ratios right now, but we'll be active in restructuring the portfolio. But we kind of like the contours of what we've got.\nPeter Winter : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you just talk about what changed in the updated margin guidance of towards 3.40 versus the prior guidance of 3.50? Is it just the higher deposit beta outlook?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'll go ahead and cover that. I mean I think more broadly, it's two overall comments, really the -- just given the pace and speed of rate changes and the impact on the migration of the deposit mix that we expect as you get into 2023 is really most and the majority of what we're looking at. So -- and that migration manifests itself in two ways. It's really the amount of DDA migration that we see as well as the cost of our relatively low-cost deposits that we're seeing not only within our platform but across the industry. So from that perspective, just kind of marking that to market with respect to what we're seeing in the trends in the fourth quarter and the rate and curve outlook that we see going throughout the rest of '23, I would hasten to add the -- what's embedded in there nevertheless, is a transformed deposit platform that back -- prior to the pandemic, we would have had DDA percentages that would be in the low 20s compared with a majority of the portfolio being outside of DDA, of course. But you fast forward to where we are in the fourth quarter, and we're at 28% of our deposit franchise is sitting in DDA. That's a significant increase versus pre-pandemic. And we expect to end the year in the sort of the mid- to high 20s in the DDA space, down a little bit from where we are today, but nevertheless, still very high quality. When you add in consumer CRE and consumer savings, which is other low cost, you end up with still about 15% or more of our deposit portfolio sitting in low-cost categories. That's up from the low 40s prior to the pandemic. So, this has been a multi-multiyear transformation of the deposit franchise. So I think we're basically just calibrating what we expect in 2023, which is with the majority of what we saw in terms of the decline from 3.50 to 3.40. I think you could also add in what's going on with the curve and front-book, back-book as well. When you look at it just how quickly rates are rising, the front book originations take a longer time to contribute. And from that perspective, we're seeing that being a driver as well. And then not only the speed of -- I guess, the last point I'll make is not only the speed of rates rising, but the inversion of the yield curve is something that is also pretty -- is a headwind to front-book, back-book. Just to end it with nevertheless, front-book, back-book is a positive tailwind over time. We're seeing 300 basis point of positive front-book, back-book across securities and our fixed rate lending businesses, that's still a tailwind. And that's going to be a driver into 2023 with net interest margins rising just not by quite as much as we thought last quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin : Wondering, Bruce heard your earlier comments about we're at 1.30 ACL day 1 adjusted for the deals in the low 1.40s now and your comments about 1.45, 1.50 year-end. I'm just wondering if you can help us, given that you're slowing loan growth and letting the auto book run out, how do you just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of what your CECL impact might be looking ahead versus the impact of slower loan growth in terms of that endpoint that you're expecting? \nBruce Van Saun : Sure. I'll start. John, you can pick up. But I'd say what we've done for the past several quarters is kind of keep looking forward as to what's the macro forecast and are there any particular segments of the portfolio that could come under stress given that the Fed has continued to push higher and the economic growth has been downgraded. So I think there's -- like I read today that over 60% of the leading economists are projecting a forecast for this year. So the reason that we've been building gradually is just taking that into account. I think at some point, you kind of get the cards turned up in 2023, and you'll have more information and less uncertainty, but we don't see that where we sit today. So I think it's prudent to continue to view the course -- likely course, is that the ACL will go up a couple of basis points a quarter like we've done and get into that 1.45 to 1.50 range. At some point, then you'll have seen whatever the recessionary impact is, and then you'll be looking forward and then you may get to the point where you can release some of those reserves depending on what your charge-off experience is. Clearly, Ken, the slower loan growth plays into that, to some degree is mitigating what the build could have been, but anyway, those are the dynamics that like, John, I don't know if you want to add to that?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'll add that. I mean just for the last couple of quarters, we've had a mild-to-moderate recession built into the. And so our peak-to-trough GDP decline that we have built into our models are 1.5%. That would be a moderate recession at this point. I think the changes you may have seen in the second half of '22 were not quite as much on the expectation that there would be a recession as much as what the collateral value outlook really impact was. So when you think about house prices and used car prices, et cetera, we've been increasing the amount of decline expected. So you've got sort of the low to mid-teens declines now built into our models for both house prices and auto prices over the foreseeable and kind of period. And so that's really -- and that's not really driving a lot of losses, just we've been having a lot of recoveries in the portfolio over the last year or so. And so you may then -- you might see some lower recoveries and that will have the -- you saw our loss that's built into our loss forecast for '23. But I think that's an important item that you saw in 4Q in terms of our outlook for 2023 and 2024.\nKenneth Usdin : Got it. Okay. And just one quick follow-up on the capital point. You're nearing 100% implies a nice incremental step up in the buyback. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of the dividend versus the buyback going forward, yet you obviously moved to $0.42 in the third quarter. Should we also think about that you would be moving the dividend up in line with increased earnings potential as well within that context?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'd say what we do here is every year, we're on a cadence where post-CCAR, we basically take that as the opportunity to broadly update our capital return profile. Over the medium term, we're looking at 35% to 40% dividend payout. And you saw that in some of our medium-term outlook. We've updated that this is going to be more of a buyback return year in '23 because of the outlook for RWAs. But we take a look at a dividend policy and earnings outlook and update whether there should be a change in the dividend after CCAR. \nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add to that, Ken, that clearly, with the uncertainty in the environment, we are being cautious in terms of the lending of kind of risk appetite. And so, I think that, in and of itself, creates some additional capital versus what we've had in prior years. I also think we still have our plate full integration of existing acquisitions and we haven't seen a whole lot that's attractive at valuations that we're interested in on the acquisition front. And so I think the combination of operating at very high profitability levels with ROTCE returns in the high teens plus more modest loan growth than historical, more modest acquisition activity than historical creates the opportunity. And I think it's appropriate given the uncertainty and chance for recession that returning capital to shareholders is the right course of action here. So you could expect we would like to raise the dividend during the course of the year, and we'd also like to get close to that 100% return of capital to shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari : On the overall deposit dynamics, I know you expect a 2% to 3% year-over-year spot decline. Can you maybe give us a little more color on how you expect overall deposit trends to progress through 2023 to get to that 2% to 3% spot decline? Maybe help us with the magnitude of declines that you think is reasonable here in the coming quarters as you look at deposit flows?\nJohn Woods : Yes, sure. I'll jump in there. I mean I think...\nBruce Van Saun : You can just start and then maybe pass it to Don and have Brendan.\nJohn Woods : Sure. Yes. That sounds good. Yes. I mean, I think overall, as I mentioned before, we're seeing deposit migration from a DDA perspective as well as from some of our lower cost levels. But broadly, the mix is superior and improved compared to pre-pandemic. I think we're around 28% DDA in 4Q, that's probably going to tick down a bit, call it to maybe 27% or so by the end of the year. That's part of the story. I'd say the -- some of the higher cost deposits in money markets and savings will be part of the runoff as well such that you get to something along the lines of 2% to 3% declined spot-to-spot end of '22 into '23. And so I'd say that you end up with some, again, improved mix compared to pre-pandemics, but a little bit of mix softening as you get throughout '23. And I'll just...\nBruce Van Saun : I would just add -- I would add to that is that I'd say we did not take in as much surge deposit as many in our peer group. We have a consumer-tilted deposit base, which tends to be more stable. And so, we've been monitoring that surge deposits quite carefully. And we have seen it actually be more sticky than we initially expected. I think where you'd see a slight runoff probably is more on the commercial side where treasurers have other alternatives besides bank deposits to move some money out. But again, we're relatively protected there because we didn't take in a lot of that money in terms of search deposits. So maybe, Don, you could comment here or Brendan?\nDon McCree : Yes. I think our spot is down a little less than 2% year-to-year. We actually ended this year a little higher than we thought we were going to because we had some nice inflow at the end of the year. But back to -- I think John said it in comments, we've really transformed our deposit base really off the back of our treasury services business, so both specialty deposit offerings, we've got two that we're now in the market with around ESG, green deposits and carbon offsets and then just the strengthening of our DDA deposits with our treasury services business gives us more stability than we would have had in prior years. So, we feel pretty good about that projection. And we're -- in general, we're really managing the balance sheet from a BSO standpoint and really we're avoiding most new transactions given just the shyness around the credit environment and the uncertainty, and we're moving clients who aren't generating positive returns off the franchise and off the balance sheet. So it gives us a little bit of a dynamic that we don't really need to go chase deposits because we're keeping the loan side relatively modestly in terms of how it grows.\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. Without being too redundant to what John mentioned, I'd say consumer has been broadly stable on deposits, which is a really good thing. And the story for us is going to be controlling the mix, but all indications are quite positive. We look at a lot of benchmarking data, and we're pretty confident that we're performing in the top quartile of our peer banks in terms of retention of low-cost deposits as well as interest-bearing deposit costs so far in the cycle. It's sort of midway through the cycle. So we've got to stay disciplined and manage it well, but it's been driven by a lot of health improvements, household growth, improvements in primacy, mix shift to Bruce's point, we were 45% mass affluent and above five years ago, we're now 60% of our customer base is mass affluent and above. So, the quality has been quite good. On the stimulus front, what we're seeing is the bottom two deciles of our customer base is essentially at the paycheck to paycheck. So that stimulus has already burned off and is in the rearview mirror. So the stimulus that remains with us tends to be with the more affluent customers, whether that's actual stimulus check. So that's balance parking that happened during COVID for not making mortgage payments and not traveling, et cetera, et cetera. We're not actually seeing that burn off as much as we're starting to see that rotate out of low-cost deposits into interest-bearing, which is natural given the stated interest rate. So, we're managing that really tight. All the investments we've made in the franchise, whether analytics, new products, the introduction of CitizensPlus in our Private Client Group as well as having Citizens Access to fence off interest-bearing deposits to maintain discipline in the core have all been really big levers for us to manage well. And all indications we see so far is that we're right on track with where we want it to be and dramatically outperforming where we were last time and up rate cycle and at worst, in line with peers, but some signs that we may be doing a bit better, which is a big turnaround from where we were five, six years ago.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, I know you stated 60% LTV on overall commercial real estate. Is that origination? And then do you happen to have refreshed LTV? I know you mentioned that a lot of your deals have sponsor participation, but we're hearing that with sponsors exiting or refinancing out certain deals that's impacting the LTV, so the refreshed LTVs may be a better read, particularly on the office front.\nJohn Woods: Yes. The office -- the 60% was the office LTVs in terms of not the overall CRE book. So, we think those are still pretty good. We're refreshing the property by property. We haven't gone through and done a total refresh on the entirety of the book yet, but we're kind of working on the maturing quarter-by-quarter maturities and working with the sponsors to either refinance out, inject equity or adjust the value of the portfolio. And that's what drove the NPL this quarter. It was really one real estate deal.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. Sorry. So that 60% is a refresh number on the office side? Or is it at origination?\nJohn Woods : It's all throughout origination.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. \nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Megan Stein] (ph) on behalf of Matt O'Connor. On capital, so the 9.5% to 10% medium-term CET1 target range, that's well above the regulatory minimum. You've built reserves a lot, and it seems like the conversion time line of ISBC is going really well. So I guess my question is, I hold so much capital down the road given solid reserves and successful deal integration time line?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say part of it is just the philosophy of liking to have a strong balance sheet. And so, I think 9.5% to 10% is a strong ratio. You've seen over time that we've originally had a target of 10% to 10.5%, and we've been kind of sliding that down as we -- our profitability goes up. And I think the stakeholders gain more confidence that we have a good strategy, and we're executing well. So it wouldn't surprise me at some point where we start to manage down in that range. I think the time of 2023 today, we're looking at a potential recession to be at the top end of that range makes sense. But once we get to the other side of that to start to move that down and maybe manage that closer to the bottom end of that range will provide more leverage. And then at that point, I think we could step back and say, do we still need 9.5% to 10% or can we skinny that down a little bit? So I think that's all in front of us, we thought at this point, given the dynamics around 2023, it wouldn't make sense to actually move that target range down.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just a -- second question is just on loans. So, the $3 billion auto runoff will offset growth in other areas this year. What are your expectations for other loan categories in 2023 coming off of a strong 2022?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'll go ahead and start there and others can chime in. But I mean, I think when you look out into 2023, we still see very, very strong opportunities in the commercial space and within C&I. And I think something to always keep in mind is our utilization is well below where historical levels would imply we should be. And so as you get into the later part of the year, you see some recovery in investments, in inventories and CapEx and possibly M&A, which actually provides financing opportunities. We see lots of opportunities across commercial. And that's really one of the main drivers. When you get into consumer, we're looking at home equity being a place that a place that we like and card and Citizens Pay would contribute as well. So that wraps up to a stable year-over-year loans and back to the point around that being taking that otherwise RWA that would have been deployed against auto and some other categories with lower risk-adjusted returns and giving that back to shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. \nManan Gosalia : I just wanted to follow up on the NIM line of questioning. I think you brought down the floor for NIM from 3.25% to 3.2%. Is that also a function of what you mentioned on the DDA migration and the curve and also the fact that you pushed out the forward swaps. Is the biggest variable on that number, mostly the cost of funding side? Or I guess would there be any changes to that 3.2% number, the Fed cuts rates sooner?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes, I'll start and flip to John. It's Bruce. But I think the two numbers are tethered together. So if the 3.50% is now seen to be 3.40%, then your floor is going to also commensurately move lower. The good news is, in a way, is that we've tightened the bottom side of that range. So previously, it was 3.50% down to 3.20%, 3.25%. So, it was 25 basis points and now it's 3.40% to 3.20%. So, it's 20 basis points. So anyway, I think we -- certainly, John's initial answer on the movement down has been focused more on migration, the DDA and low-cost migration, but then also some of the impact from the yield curve on front book back book has been the other dynamic. So those are the things that we're watching. But John, you can out from there.\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'd say the only thing I'd add, just to remember, we constructed -- we modeled that 3.20% and there's a lot of assumptions that go into that with respect to what the mix of the balance sheet would be, et cetera. And what we're assuming is a 200 basis point gradual decline in 2024 that would get you down to that 3.20%. And given that we are still asset sensitive and we haven't closed out that position, that's really what you're seeing in terms of the decline in net interest margin. So as and when we continue to look at ways to lock in protection against down rates, you could see that 3.20% move around based on hedging activities as well as updated views on what the mix of the balance sheet is likely to be in the context of what's the Fed...\nBruce Van Saun : It's a very dynamic process. So we look and see where the forward day rates are going to be. We have our own view of that. We see what the valuations we can get in the hedge market are. And you can be assured, I think we played our hand quite well so far, and we'll continue to stay really focused on.\nManan Gosalia : I appreciate that. And then separately, just on the program. Can you unpack some of the drivers there of the $100 million in pre-tax benefits and maybe how quickly those can come out from the expense base over the course of the year?\nJohn Woods : Yes, I'll go and cover that. I'd say the one dynamic to keep in mind is that we tend to form these programs and generate a year-end run rate benefit that will contribute for each of them. Mostly on the one hand, the $100 million will build throughout '23 so that it gets to a run rate when you get to the fourth quarter of '23. But keep in mind, we did the same thing with TOP 7. So, there's a full-year effect of TOP 7 that comes in. And so when the programs are reasonably similarly sized, you can almost use that as an estimate of what the contribution is in any given year. And so you have maybe a combined $100 million plus contribution from the full-year effect of TOP 7 hitting '23 and the in-year effective TOP 8 hitting '23. And so the big drivers of that really you've got the traditional areas that we focus on, which is third-party costs and vendor cost management, which is an area that's been contributing over the years as well as continue to optimize the branch network. And just being really careful about ensuring that our organizational approach is fit for purpose with respect to what we're trying to accomplish in '23. So those are more traditional areas. The other places we're looking at that have been more recent include maturing our Agile delivery model away from a waterfall approach to agile and next-gen technology initiatives continue to contribute as well. We're working towards a data center exit in 2025. We're looking to migrate to the cloud from our internal applications, and that's contributing in '23 as well. But there's a lot of very strategic sort of initiatives that are built within the TOP 8 program and we're excited about it. It's part of who we are, and we're looking forward to deliver against that next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja : A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, the deposit betas that you expect to get to the high 30s. Given the pace of change in the fourth quarter, should we and your expectation for rate hikes early in the year and not after that, should we expect you get to that in Q1? Any color on that, on the pace of it, especially given how rates have been going up?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean I think we'll not get there in Q1. That is an over-the-year expectation in terms of the cumulative growth. I mean I think you'll see the growth in cumulative betas begin to moderate and flatten out. You have the big jumps early in the cycle. So, we began and go way back to the second quarter of '22, our cumulative beta was 6%. And then you get to the fourth quarter, the cumulative beta is 29. So you've got 23 points just in '22 and you'll have -- and then we're looking for in '23 is another 9 points. So, this -- and it will increase over time. You won't get to 38 in the first quarter and will gradually...\nBruce Van Saun : Deposit tend to replace reprice with a lag. So even after the Fed pauses, you still see a little bit of upward pressure on those betas.\nJohn Woods : That's right.\nVivek Juneja : But I would -- okay. But then does that mean, Bruce, the bulk of it is probably early on and just a little further increase after that, after the Fed is done?\nJohn Woods : I'd say the majority in 1H and it continues to trickle-in in 2H, and that's built into our outlook.\nVivek Juneja : Okay. Different question, a second one. Fee income, your guide of about 7% to 9% growth in full-year '23 versus '22. How much of that would you expect would come from capital markets or at least what's in your forecast that you're thinking how much comes from capital markets?\nJohn Woods : Yes, I think there's a big part of it. I mean, back to the big drivers, you had capital markets, and you heard about card fees from Brendan and wealth from Brendan as well. So those are the three big ones. You see mortgage really potentially rebounding as well.\nBruce Van Saun : A little bit of rebounding.\nJohn Woods : But a big part of it would come from capital markets from the underwriting perspective and M&A advisory, just as we may have mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some deals pushed from 4Q into 1Q. So that's going to support the capital markets business, which, by the way, over the years, has really become a very diversified capital markets business itself. I mean just broadening out M&A advisory, underwriting and loan syndications. Those businesses really tend to really diversify our overall fee outlook. But yes, a good part of it and a good chunk of the growth in '23 comes from capital markets.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks. \nBruce Van Saun : Okay. Great. So, thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Big picture, 2022 was a strong year for Citizens with significant delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Most notably, we closed our acquisitions of HSBC and ISBC. We captured the benefit of higher rates with strong NII and NIM, and our balance sheet and interest rate position were well managed.  While fee revenues were impacted by the environment, we are very well positioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when markets normalize, particularly in capital markets. Mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time, and we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments. We are actively managing our loan portfolio, focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business into 2023 and beyond. We continue to maintain good expense discipline, delivering in excess of $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefit through TOP 7, generating 4.7% underlying positive operating leverage for the year and 16.4% full-year ROTCE. Let me give you the headlines for the financial results, referencing slide five. For the fourth quarter, we reported underlying net income of $685 million and EPS of $1.32. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 19.4%. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter with 5 basis points of margin expansion to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio. Period ended average loans are broadly stable linked quarter, up 1%, excluding auto runoff. We grew deposits up 1% linked quarter and our LDR was stable at 87%. Fees showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 1% linked quarter. We saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven by underwriting and M&A, but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a CDA DDA impact in our FX and IRP business. Expenses were broadly stable linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 1% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.4%. Our credit metrics were good, with NCOs of 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $132 million and a reserve build of $44 million this quarter. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, up from 1.41% at the end of the third quarter and approximately 13 basis points above our pro forma day 1 CECL adoption coverage ratio. Our tangible book value per share is up 5% linked quarter. Next, I'll provide further details related to the fourth quarter results. On slide six, net interest income was up 2% given higher net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.3% was up 5 basis points. As you can see on the NIM walk on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. With Fed funds increasing 425 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 29% through the end of the fourth quarter. Moving on to slide seven. We posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 1% linked quarter with lower mortgage and FX and derivatives fees, partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees. Focusing on capital markets. Market volatility continued through the quarter. However, underwriting and M&A advisory fees picked up. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline, including several deals that were pushed into Q1. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production volumes. We have seen pressure on volumes moderating and size of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time. Servicing operating fees were stable. Card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter.  On slide eight, expenses were well controlled, broadly stable linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program delivered over $115 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. We are excited to announce the launch of our new TOP 8 program, and I'll cover that in a few slides. On slide nine, average and period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter but up 1% ex auto runoff with 1% growth in commercial, reflecting demand in asset-backed financing and growth in CRE, primarily reflecting line draws and slower paydowns. We have seen commercial utilization moderate a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of a softer economy. Average retail loans are down slightly, but up 1% ex planned runoff in auto, given growth in mortgage and home equity, which bring an opportunity for deeper relationships and better risk-adjusted returns. On slide 10, average deposits were up $1.4 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth primarily coming from term deposits, money market accounts and Citizens Access Savings. Overall, commercial banking deposits were up 2.4% and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 67 basis points, which translates to a 29% cumulative beta, broadly consistent with our expectations. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We achieved overall deposit growth this quarter, and we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. Overall liquidity remains strong as we reduced our FHLB advances by $1.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Our period-end LDR improved slightly to 86.7%. Moving on to slide 11. We saw a good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter, which is still low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans are 60 basis points of total loans, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, given an increase in commercial, largely in CRE. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumers vary. Although personal disposable income remains strong, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased. Turning to slide 12, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. While our current credit metrics are good, we increased our allowance by $44 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.43%, which is a modest increase from the third quarter. The current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation, supply chain issues, higher interest rates and return to office trends. Given these pressures, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. Back on slide 32 in the appendix, we have provided some additional information about the CRE portfolio. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 1.86% includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio while the multifamily portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement. The $6.3 billion office portfolio includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back-to-office trends. The remaining $4 billion relates to the general office segment for which we are holding a roughly 5% allowance coverage. About 95% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas. Moving to slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our range. Tangible book value per share was up 5% in the quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.3%. We returned a total of $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our strong capital position, combined with our earnings outlook, puts us in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases. Shifting gears, a bit. Starting on slide 14, we'll cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive outperformance over the next few years. We have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think have big potential and where we have a right to win. So, in Consumer, we've got four big opportunities. First is our push into New York Metro. We are investing in brand marketing, doing well in the technology conversions and putting our best people against the market opportunity. We are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the HSBC branches driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The full ISBC conversion is just around the corner on President's weekend, and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product line-up and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market. You will see more details on slide 28 and 29 in the appendix. Importantly, we achieved about 70% in run rate of our planned $130 million of investors' net expense synergies as of the end of the year and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. Moving to wealth. We've launched a number of exciting initiatives with Citizens Private Client and CitizensPlus as we orient the business towards financial planning led advice. These should really help us penetrate the opportunity with our existing customer base. On slide 15, our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved that to a cloud-based platform, and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass affluent market segment. Where we might have only had a lending or deposit relationship before, our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers in a comprehensive way. And we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. Citizens Pay, for example, is an area where we have significant running room. We've attracted many new partners, up about 150 versus a year ago, which should really ramp the business. And we built an industry-leading home equity business, powered by our innovative fast line process, which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital innovations that have drastically reduced originations time. Moving to the Commercial Bank on slide 16 and 17. We filled in all the product gaps. Acquisitions brought us M&A and other advisory capabilities, and we built out debt capital market capabilities organically. We've hired some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high-growth regions around the country and the right industry verticals to serve larger companies. We also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well positioned to support private equity capital. Bottom line, we have aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues. Moving to slide 18. We are excited to announce the launch of our latest TOP program. Even as we push forward on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 7 program achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of approximately $115 million at the end of 2022. And we've launched TOP 8 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2023, with that split about 80-20 between efficiency and revenue-oriented initiatives. Moving to slide 19. I'll walk through the outlook for the full-year, which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end of December forward curve view of two 25 basis point Fed hikes before an expected 25 basis point cut in the fourth quarter. We expect solid NII growth, up 11% to 14%, and we project our NIM to gradually rise towards approximately 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023. Our overall hedge position is expected to provide a NIM floor of about 3.2% through the fourth quarter of 2024 and a gradual 200 basis point decline across the curve, commencing in Q4 2023. In the fourth quarter, we took actions to transition $3 billion of active swaps from 2023 to forward-starting positions in 2024. And we've done even more so far in January to rebalance the distribution of down rate protection. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on slide 30. We expect moderate loan growth with average loans up 4% to 5%. We are targeting about $3 billion of spot auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect total average earning assets to be up 3% to 4%. On the deposit side, we see 3% average deposit growth and a 2% to 3% spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at year-end reaching the high 30s. These are expected to be up 7% to 9% with a capital markets rebound building over the course of the year. Noninterest expense is expected to be up roughly 7% or about 3.5% to 4% if you adjust for the full-year effect of the HSBC and investors acquisitions and the FDIC premium increase. If the year unfolds as we expect, we should be able to drive about 400 basis points to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. Given current macro trends and portfolio originations, we expect that our ACL ratio will rise to the 1.45% to 1.5% level, depending upon how the economy fares. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%, even with our target payout ratio approaching 100%. All of this translates into a ROTCE in the high teens for 2023. On slide 20, we provide the guide for Q1. Note that Q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. Moving to slide 21. As Bruce mentioned, we have completely transformed the franchise since the IPO, executing well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets, and we are ready to raise the bar, lifting our ROTCE target of 16% to 18%. The key to the further ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. As we look out over the medium term, we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth and we will continue to be balance -- continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully. And even if rates come down a bit, we expect NII to benefit from the protection we have put on through the swap portfolio. You should expect us to stay disciplined on expenses. Credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens. And we continue to focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this timeframe, we would expect our CET1 ratio to remain within our target range of 9.5% to 10%. To sum up, slide 22, we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, and we have a positive outlook for 2023. We are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in 2023 with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position. We've taken actions to protect our NIM and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are moving forward executing against our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and outperformance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. I mean on the big picture, we -- asset sensitivity last quarter was around 3%. We're a little bit below that this quarter just given the way the outlook for the balance sheet appears to be playing out in 2023. So as we're -- as you've seen over time, we've taken our asset sensitivity down. We are -- most of that asset sensitivity is really driven by the short end of the curve, which we expect to remain elevated throughout 2023. And as a result, we're looking at some of the down rate protection that we had in place in 2023 and just repositioning that out of spot-starting active swaps into forward-starting swaps into 2024 and beyond. So we're looking to looking to basically push that out and basically get that down rate protection smoothed out into the '24 and '25 periods rather than holding on to all of that down rate protection here in '23. That's the main objective in what we were doing in the fourth quarter, and we've done a little bit more of that in early 1Q. And then more broadly, we're looking at net interest margin, that corridor, if you will, we're trying to protect that corridor with -- at the low end, if rates were to fall by 200 basis points out in 2024, that you'll see a floor of around 320. So you see that 320 to 340 corridor being something that over time is more narrow than you would have seen from us maybe in past cycles. So that's the main objective. Yes. Maybe I'll just talk about the coverage levels. Just broadly, as you may have seen in our materials that the CRE coverage from an allowance standpoint is around 186 basis points. But when you carve out some of the really high-quality stuff in multifamily and credit tenant lease and life sciences, you get to our general office segment, where we have very healthy coverage of around 5%. So there are some -- we are seeing some trends there that are telling us that we should be putting away some reserves to deal with the back-to-office trends that are a headwind in that space. So, you got good healthy coverage of around 5%. We are seeing some of that tick into the nonaccrual space. I would say more broadly, that will -- even though that goes into nonaccrual, our overall pre-LTVs are typically around 60%. And so, you got to distinguish from non-accruals for actual loss content. And so even though we're putting some allowance away, we feel like that's commensurate with the loss content that we see in the book. And I'll just stop there and... Yes. I'll go ahead and cover that. I mean I think more broadly, it's two overall comments, really the -- just given the pace and speed of rate changes and the impact on the migration of the deposit mix that we expect as you get into 2023 is really most and the majority of what we're looking at. So -- and that migration manifests itself in two ways. It's really the amount of DDA migration that we see as well as the cost of our relatively low-cost deposits that we're seeing not only within our platform but across the industry. So from that perspective, just kind of marking that to market with respect to what we're seeing in the trends in the fourth quarter and the rate and curve outlook that we see going throughout the rest of '23, I would hasten to add the -- what's embedded in there nevertheless, is a transformed deposit platform that back -- prior to the pandemic, we would have had DDA percentages that would be in the low 20s compared with a majority of the portfolio being outside of DDA, of course. But you fast forward to where we are in the fourth quarter, and we're at 28% of our deposit franchise is sitting in DDA. That's a significant increase versus pre-pandemic. And we expect to end the year in the sort of the mid- to high 20s in the DDA space, down a little bit from where we are today, but nevertheless, still very high quality. When you add in consumer CRE and consumer savings, which is other low cost, you end up with still about 15% or more of our deposit portfolio sitting in low-cost categories. That's up from the low 40s prior to the pandemic. So, this has been a multi-multiyear transformation of the deposit franchise. So I think we're basically just calibrating what we expect in 2023, which is with the majority of what we saw in terms of the decline from 3.50 to 3.40. I think you could also add in what's going on with the curve and front-book, back-book as well. When you look at it just how quickly rates are rising, the front book originations take a longer time to contribute. And from that perspective, we're seeing that being a driver as well. And then not only the speed of -- I guess, the last point I'll make is not only the speed of rates rising, but the inversion of the yield curve is something that is also pretty -- is a headwind to front-book, back-book. Just to end it with nevertheless, front-book, back-book is a positive tailwind over time. We're seeing 300 basis point of positive front-book, back-book across securities and our fixed rate lending businesses, that's still a tailwind. And that's going to be a driver into 2023 with net interest margins rising just not by quite as much as we thought last quarter. Yes. I'll add that. I mean just for the last couple of quarters, we've had a mild-to-moderate recession built into the. And so our peak-to-trough GDP decline that we have built into our models are 1.5%. That would be a moderate recession at this point. I think the changes you may have seen in the second half of '22 were not quite as much on the expectation that there would be a recession as much as what the collateral value outlook really impact was. So when you think about house prices and used car prices, et cetera, we've been increasing the amount of decline expected. So you've got sort of the low to mid-teens declines now built into our models for both house prices and auto prices over the foreseeable and kind of period. And so that's really -- and that's not really driving a lot of losses, just we've been having a lot of recoveries in the portfolio over the last year or so. And so you may then -- you might see some lower recoveries and that will have the -- you saw our loss that's built into our loss forecast for '23. But I think that's an important item that you saw in 4Q in terms of our outlook for 2023 and 2024. Yes. I'd say what we do here is every year, we're on a cadence where post-CCAR, we basically take that as the opportunity to broadly update our capital return profile. Over the medium term, we're looking at 35% to 40% dividend payout. And you saw that in some of our medium-term outlook. We've updated that this is going to be more of a buyback return year in '23 because of the outlook for RWAs. But we take a look at a dividend policy and earnings outlook and update whether there should be a change in the dividend after CCAR. Yes, sure. I'll jump in there. I mean I think... Sure. Yes. That sounds good. Yes. I mean, I think overall, as I mentioned before, we're seeing deposit migration from a DDA perspective as well as from some of our lower cost levels. But broadly, the mix is superior and improved compared to pre-pandemic. I think we're around 28% DDA in 4Q, that's probably going to tick down a bit, call it to maybe 27% or so by the end of the year. That's part of the story. I'd say the -- some of the higher cost deposits in money markets and savings will be part of the runoff as well such that you get to something along the lines of 2% to 3% declined spot-to-spot end of '22 into '23. And so I'd say that you end up with some, again, improved mix compared to pre-pandemics, but a little bit of mix softening as you get throughout '23. And I'll just... Yes. The office -- the 60% was the office LTVs in terms of not the overall CRE book. So, we think those are still pretty good. We're refreshing the property by property. We haven't gone through and done a total refresh on the entirety of the book yet, but we're kind of working on the maturing quarter-by-quarter maturities and working with the sponsors to either refinance out, inject equity or adjust the value of the portfolio. And that's what drove the NPL this quarter. It was really one real estate deal. It's all throughout origination. Yes. I'll go ahead and start there and others can chime in. But I mean, I think when you look out into 2023, we still see very, very strong opportunities in the commercial space and within C&I. And I think something to always keep in mind is our utilization is well below where historical levels would imply we should be. And so as you get into the later part of the year, you see some recovery in investments, in inventories and CapEx and possibly M&A, which actually provides financing opportunities. We see lots of opportunities across commercial. And that's really one of the main drivers. When you get into consumer, we're looking at home equity being a place that a place that we like and card and Citizens Pay would contribute as well. So that wraps up to a stable year-over-year loans and back to the point around that being taking that otherwise RWA that would have been deployed against auto and some other categories with lower risk-adjusted returns and giving that back to shareholders. Yes. I'd say the only thing I'd add, just to remember, we constructed -- we modeled that 3.20% and there's a lot of assumptions that go into that with respect to what the mix of the balance sheet would be, et cetera. And what we're assuming is a 200 basis point gradual decline in 2024 that would get you down to that 3.20%. And given that we are still asset sensitive and we haven't closed out that position, that's really what you're seeing in terms of the decline in net interest margin. So as and when we continue to look at ways to lock in protection against down rates, you could see that 3.20% move around based on hedging activities as well as updated views on what the mix of the balance sheet is likely to be in the context of what's the Fed... Yes, I'll go and cover that. I'd say the one dynamic to keep in mind is that we tend to form these programs and generate a year-end run rate benefit that will contribute for each of them. Mostly on the one hand, the $100 million will build throughout '23 so that it gets to a run rate when you get to the fourth quarter of '23. But keep in mind, we did the same thing with TOP 7. So, there's a full-year effect of TOP 7 that comes in. And so when the programs are reasonably similarly sized, you can almost use that as an estimate of what the contribution is in any given year. And so you have maybe a combined $100 million plus contribution from the full-year effect of TOP 7 hitting '23 and the in-year effective TOP 8 hitting '23. And so the big drivers of that really you've got the traditional areas that we focus on, which is third-party costs and vendor cost management, which is an area that's been contributing over the years as well as continue to optimize the branch network. And just being really careful about ensuring that our organizational approach is fit for purpose with respect to what we're trying to accomplish in '23. So those are more traditional areas. The other places we're looking at that have been more recent include maturing our Agile delivery model away from a waterfall approach to agile and next-gen technology initiatives continue to contribute as well. We're working towards a data center exit in 2025. We're looking to migrate to the cloud from our internal applications, and that's contributing in '23 as well. But there's a lot of very strategic sort of initiatives that are built within the TOP 8 program and we're excited about it. It's part of who we are, and we're looking forward to deliver against that next year. Yes. I mean I think we'll not get there in Q1. That is an over-the-year expectation in terms of the cumulative growth. I mean I think you'll see the growth in cumulative betas begin to moderate and flatten out. You have the big jumps early in the cycle. So, we began and go way back to the second quarter of '22, our cumulative beta was 6%. And then you get to the fourth quarter, the cumulative beta is 29. So you've got 23 points just in '22 and you'll have -- and then we're looking for in '23 is another 9 points. So, this -- and it will increase over time. You won't get to 38 in the first quarter and will gradually... That's right. I'd say the majority in 1H and it continues to trickle-in in 2H, and that's built into our outlook. Yes, I think there's a big part of it. I mean, back to the big drivers, you had capital markets, and you heard about card fees from Brendan and wealth from Brendan as well. So those are the three big ones. You see mortgage really potentially rebounding as well. But a big part of it would come from capital markets from the underwriting perspective and M&A advisory, just as we may have mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw some deals pushed from 4Q into 1Q. So that's going to support the capital markets business, which, by the way, over the years, has really become a very diversified capital markets business itself. I mean just broadening out M&A advisory, underwriting and loan syndications. Those businesses really tend to really diversify our overall fee outlook. But yes, a good part of it and a good chunk of the growth in '23 comes from capital markets."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes. I think you've pretty much covered it on cap markets. I said this last quarter, I'll just remind people, again, we are a middle market investment bank. So we're not dependent on these giant transactions that need $5 billion of financing. We do singles and doubles all day long, and our pipelines are reasonably strong with a very heavy content of private equity who is a watch with cash. So, there will be transactions. If you don't get regular way transactions, you're going to get a lot of restructuring transactions. So, there's minority capital. There's a lot of different ways to skin the cat. So, we're relatively optimistic about what's ahead of us in the coming year. I'll just say for the office portfolio, but CRE in general, it's first and foremost, who's the sponsor and who's the investor, and we have a very high-quality group of investors that we do business with, which are largely institutional. Second is what MSAs are you in and where are you? And we think suburban will do better than urban. As we said in the comments, we're heavily weighted to suburban. So, we're going through every single property in the office portfolio. We'll restructure a lot of them with the sponsors. We restructured one already this year where the sponsor-contributed equity. So, we're comfortable around where we are with the coverage ratios right now, but we'll be active in restructuring the portfolio. But we kind of like the contours of what we've got. Yes. I think our spot is down a little less than 2% year-to-year. We actually ended this year a little higher than we thought we were going to because we had some nice inflow at the end of the year. But back to -- I think John said it in comments, we've really transformed our deposit base really off the back of our treasury services business, so both specialty deposit offerings, we've got two that we're now in the market with around ESG, green deposits and carbon offsets and then just the strengthening of our DDA deposits with our treasury services business gives us more stability than we would have had in prior years. So, we feel pretty good about that projection. And we're -- in general, we're really managing the balance sheet from a BSO standpoint and really we're avoiding most new transactions given just the shyness around the credit environment and the uncertainty, and we're moving clients who aren't generating positive returns off the franchise and off the balance sheet. So it gives us a little bit of a dynamic that we don't really need to go chase deposits because we're keeping the loan side relatively modestly in terms of how it grows."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Kristin. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We're pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full-year and we feel well positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in 2023. We are playing strong defense with a robust balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. At the same time, we continue to play disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. We are focused on building out a prudent, sustainable growth trajectory over the medium-term. I'll comment briefly on the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying EPS was $1.32, our return on tangible common equity was 19.4% and the efficiency ratio was 54%. Sequential operating leverage was 1% and sequential PPNR growth was 2.6%. Leading our performance was 2% sequential NII growth, reflecting NIM expansion of 5 basis points to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given the impact of a $900 million reduction in our auto portfolio. Growth was 1% ex this impact. Deposits were solid with 1% sequential growth, and our LDR remained stable at 87%. Our fee businesses showed resilience and diversity given a challenging environment, down about 1% sequentially. A number of M&A fees pushed into Q1 and mortgage results were softer than expected. We maintained stable expenses in the quarter, and credit metrics remain good. We boosted our allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of loans, which compares with pro forma day 1 CECL levels of 1.30%. We restarted our share repurchase activity in Q4, buying $150 million of stock and we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10% at the top of our targeted range. For full-year 2022, we delivered underlying EPS of $4.84 and ROTCE of 16.4% as we captured the benefit of rising rates and our strengthened deposit base. The results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide, which we included in the appendix of the presentation. With respect to our guidance for 2023, we assume a slowdown in economic growth to 1% for the year, two early Fed rate hikes and a Q4 cut and inflation getting below 3% by Q4. We project moderate loan growth, partially offset by continued run off in our auto book of close to $3 billion. Overall, we see solid NII growth as NIM gradually rises to 3.4% over the year, a roughly 8% growth in fees to kind of rebound in capital markets fees over the course of the year, solid expense discipline with core expense growth ex acquisition and FDIC impacts of 3.5% to 4%.  We announced today our TOP 8 program, which targets $100 million in run rate benefits and about 80% of that is expense impact. Credit should be manageable with net charge-offs in the 30 to 35 basis point range and we expect to build our ACL to 1.45% to 1.5% of loans. We expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given strong profitability, modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions with our CET1 ratio forecast near the high end of our 9.5% to 10% range. Capital return to shareholders should approach 100% and yield to investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase put TOP 12%. So, all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2022, and we feel we are well positioned in 2023 to continue our journey towards becoming a top-performing bank. We continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer, commercial and the enterprise. We've transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits. We've adjusted our interest hedging to protect against lower rates through 2025. Given the improvement in our ROTCE over time, we are raising our medium-term target to 16% to 18% from 14% to 16%. We've stayed focused on positive operating leverage. We've captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment, and we still have plenty of upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve. Exciting times for Citizens. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2022. We know we can count on you again in the new year. And with that, I'll turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. And operator, why don't we open it up for Q&A? And I would just add to that, Scott, in our view in the macro is that the Fed likely moves maybe most or twice the forward curve as they'll move up 25 basis points a couple of times and then stop. And then typically, they would pause for six or seven months before they would cut. And so if there's a cut happening, it likely happens very late in the year and maybe it could be early next year. So guided by that view, that's kind of why we're pushing out that downside protection a bit. Sure. So, I think really, you put your finger on it there, Scott, is the capital markets business. We've had really strong pipelines this year. But because of the volatility because of the fact that the Fed is still moving higher, that's created uncertainty and just an inability to actually get the money to work from private equity or some of the deals done because the financing hasn't been there the way it's been in the past. And so I think as you -- going back to that macro forecast as the Fed is likely nearing kind of the destination in terms of peak rates. I think that starts to loosen up the markets, the financing markets, you'll see less volatility and a lot of the business is kind of clocked into our pipeline will start to print and get delivered, and we'll start to see more transactions. So just by reference, most of the quarters this year, our capital markets revenues were at $90 million to $100 million. If you go back to the fourth quarter of 2021, we had $184 million of fees, so roughly double that level. So we thought coming into this year that we'd have much stronger levels of revenue generation. But the good news is we still have a great overall focus on the right sectors in the market. We've got a great team. And so, I think you'll see that start to rev up as we see the market conditions improve. Beyond that, I'm also quite optimistic. We've made a lot of investments in the wealth business. And again, there, if you start to see some stability in the asset markets, we should get a kind of tailwind from that plus the investments that we've made. So, feel confident about that. And then I'd say mortgage is so washed out. I keep thinking it can't go any lower, and it did in the fourth quarter. But I think you're starting to see people exit the business and coming out of the business. And so you'll start to see margins expand, and I think volumes will tick-up as we go through the year, again, linked back to the Fed reaching the destination and some stability on rates. So those would be the big things. I'm happy to pass the horn here. Don, do you want to say anything else...? Yes. Brandon, anything...? Hey, Don, do you want to add? Sure. I'll start. John, you can pick up. But I'd say what we've done for the past several quarters is kind of keep looking forward as to what's the macro forecast and are there any particular segments of the portfolio that could come under stress given that the Fed has continued to push higher and the economic growth has been downgraded. So I think there's -- like I read today that over 60% of the leading economists are projecting a forecast for this year. So the reason that we've been building gradually is just taking that into account. I think at some point, you kind of get the cards turned up in 2023, and you'll have more information and less uncertainty, but we don't see that where we sit today. So I think it's prudent to continue to view the course -- likely course, is that the ACL will go up a couple of basis points a quarter like we've done and get into that 1.45 to 1.50 range. At some point, then you'll have seen whatever the recessionary impact is, and then you'll be looking forward and then you may get to the point where you can release some of those reserves depending on what your charge-off experience is. Clearly, Ken, the slower loan growth plays into that, to some degree is mitigating what the build could have been, but anyway, those are the dynamics that like, John, I don't know if you want to add to that? Yes. And I would just add to that, Ken, that clearly, with the uncertainty in the environment, we are being cautious in terms of the lending of kind of risk appetite. And so, I think that, in and of itself, creates some additional capital versus what we've had in prior years. I also think we still have our plate full integration of existing acquisitions and we haven't seen a whole lot that's attractive at valuations that we're interested in on the acquisition front. And so I think the combination of operating at very high profitability levels with ROTCE returns in the high teens plus more modest loan growth than historical, more modest acquisition activity than historical creates the opportunity. And I think it's appropriate given the uncertainty and chance for recession that returning capital to shareholders is the right course of action here. So you could expect we would like to raise the dividend during the course of the year, and we'd also like to get close to that 100% return of capital to shareholders. You can just start and then maybe pass it to Don and have Brendan. I would just add -- I would add to that is that I'd say we did not take in as much surge deposit as many in our peer group. We have a consumer-tilted deposit base, which tends to be more stable. And so, we've been monitoring that surge deposits quite carefully. And we have seen it actually be more sticky than we initially expected. I think where you'd see a slight runoff probably is more on the commercial side where treasurers have other alternatives besides bank deposits to move some money out. But again, we're relatively protected there because we didn't take in a lot of that money in terms of search deposits. So maybe, Don, you could comment here or Brendan? Yes. I would say part of it is just the philosophy of liking to have a strong balance sheet. And so, I think 9.5% to 10% is a strong ratio. You've seen over time that we've originally had a target of 10% to 10.5%, and we've been kind of sliding that down as we -- our profitability goes up. And I think the stakeholders gain more confidence that we have a good strategy, and we're executing well. So it wouldn't surprise me at some point where we start to manage down in that range. I think the time of 2023 today, we're looking at a potential recession to be at the top end of that range makes sense. But once we get to the other side of that to start to move that down and maybe manage that closer to the bottom end of that range will provide more leverage. And then at that point, I think we could step back and say, do we still need 9.5% to 10% or can we skinny that down a little bit? So I think that's all in front of us, we thought at this point, given the dynamics around 2023, it wouldn't make sense to actually move that target range down. Yes, I'll start and flip to John. It's Bruce. But I think the two numbers are tethered together. So if the 3.50% is now seen to be 3.40%, then your floor is going to also commensurately move lower. The good news is, in a way, is that we've tightened the bottom side of that range. So previously, it was 3.50% down to 3.20%, 3.25%. So, it was 25 basis points and now it's 3.40% to 3.20%. So, it's 20 basis points. So anyway, I think we -- certainly, John's initial answer on the movement down has been focused more on migration, the DDA and low-cost migration, but then also some of the impact from the yield curve on front book back book has been the other dynamic. So those are the things that we're watching. But John, you can out from there. It's a very dynamic process. So we look and see where the forward day rates are going to be. We have our own view of that. We see what the valuations we can get in the hedge market are. And you can be assured, I think we played our hand quite well so far, and we'll continue to stay really focused on. Deposit tend to replace reprice with a lag. So even after the Fed pauses, you still see a little bit of upward pressure on those betas. A little bit of rebounding. Okay. Great. So, thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day."

            "content": "I think you nailed that pretty well. I'd say well for the year, we're projecting slow and steady, continued progress, and it's a bit of a hopeful coiled spring when the equity markets really come back. But as long as they're stable, we should see some growth. I'd say the other bright spot is debt and ATM fees that continue to hit records both through customer engagement and primacy and all the investments we made in the health of the franchise that's also translating into our deposit quality, also some restructure on vendor relations and such that's giving us a bit of a boost there, too. So that should be a continued area of slow and steady progress. On the other side, there will continue to be a little bit of pressure still on overdraft income and service charges, but we're sort of near the -- that's in the run rate. Most of that's in the run rate. So we're sort of near the bottom, which is good that we'll move away from being a headwind for us, real soon. Yes. Without being too redundant to what John mentioned, I'd say consumer has been broadly stable on deposits, which is a really good thing. And the story for us is going to be controlling the mix, but all indications are quite positive. We look at a lot of benchmarking data, and we're pretty confident that we're performing in the top quartile of our peer banks in terms of retention of low-cost deposits as well as interest-bearing deposit costs so far in the cycle. It's sort of midway through the cycle. So we've got to stay disciplined and manage it well, but it's been driven by a lot of health improvements, household growth, improvements in primacy, mix shift to Bruce's point, we were 45% mass affluent and above five years ago, we're now 60% of our customer base is mass affluent and above. So, the quality has been quite good. On the stimulus front, what we're seeing is the bottom two deciles of our customer base is essentially at the paycheck to paycheck. So that stimulus has already burned off and is in the rearview mirror. So the stimulus that remains with us tends to be with the more affluent customers, whether that's actual stimulus check. So that's balance parking that happened during COVID for not making mortgage payments and not traveling, et cetera, et cetera. We're not actually seeing that burn off as much as we're starting to see that rotate out of low-cost deposits into interest-bearing, which is natural given the stated interest rate. So, we're managing that really tight. All the investments we've made in the franchise, whether analytics, new products, the introduction of CitizensPlus in our Private Client Group as well as having Citizens Access to fence off interest-bearing deposits to maintain discipline in the core have all been really big levers for us to manage well. And all indications we see so far is that we're right on track with where we want it to be and dramatically outperforming where we were last time and up rate cycle and at worst, in line with peers, but some signs that we may be doing a bit better, which is a big turnaround from where we were five, six years ago."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another very strong quarterly result in Q3. Rising rates positively impacted our net interest income and net interest margin. Fees and expenses were broadly stable and credit performance remains excellent. We grew average loans 2% and deposits 1% as our liquidity and funding position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 9.8% is above the midpoint of our 9.5% to 10% target range. Our TCE to total asset ratio sits at 6.1%. Performance metrics include a net interest margin of 3.25% and that's up 21 basis points. We had positive sequential operating leverage of 6%. We had hit an efficiency ratio below 55% and our return on tangible common equity was around 18%. We built our credit reserves by $49 million with our ACL at 1.41%, and that's above the 1. 3% day 1 CECL reserve adjusted for the Investors acquisition. Beyond these impressive financial results, we've continued to make good progress in executing our strategic initiatives. In Consumer, we launched Citizens Private Client, which will help drive wealth opportunities. We migrated our national digital bank to a modern cloud-based platform. We continue to grow share with Citizens Pay, and we're executing well on our expansion into New York City Metro region. In Commercial, we've successfully integrated recent acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital into our coverage and product model. Our M&A pipelines are at record levels and our geographic and industry vertical build-out is delivering strong results in terms of market share gains. Enterprise wide, we're successfully ramping up our TOP 7 program, while building out TOP 8. Stay tuned on that. Our NextGen Tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a game changer for us. These programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement finding ways to run the bank more efficiently so we can deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund investments for our future. We're also doing some interesting things in DSG such as developing a carbon offset program for clients as well as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy, and we have more interesting innovation in the pipeline. As we look forward to Q4 in 2023, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep growing and enhancing our franchise value. We are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. But we also plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our metal and deliver responsible, sustainable growth. One aspect that we emphasize in today's presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base, but we've been able to transform over time. We've had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters, as some peers are seeing outflows, and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack. We're seeing very strong loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through 2024, assuming the current forward curve. As a result, our NIM will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on. We've also layered in sizable net interest rate hedges to protect NIM and ROTCE through 2024 if the Fed reverses and brings down short-term rates, moving off of the zero bound for short rates has unlocked the value of our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our ROTCE. With a clearer macro outlook and less market volatility, we feel the value of our commercial bank build-out will also manifest, benefiting further our ROTCE. So very exciting time for Citizens.  And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing Slide 5. We reported underlying net income of $669 million and EPS of $1.30. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.9%. Net interest income was up 11% linked quarter, driven by a 21 basis point improvement in margin to 3.25% and 2% growth in average interest-earning assets. Average loans are up 2% linked quarter, with 3% growth in commercial. Fees were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year and mortgage results softened a bit. Capital markets fees and service charges were stable. We remain highly disciplined on expenses, which are up 1% linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 6% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.9%. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $123 million and a reserve build of $49 million this quarter, which reflects an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.41%, up from 1.37% at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of approximately 1.3%. Our tangible book value per share is down 8.6% linked quarter, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 9.8%, just above the midpoint of our target range. Next, I'll provide further details related to third quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 11%, given higher net interest margin and 2% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.25%, up 21 basis points. As you can see on the new block in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, the healthy increase in asset yields outpaced funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 7. With the current expectation for the Fed to rates further, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII year-to-date and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth quarter and compound into 2023. Our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately 3.3% at the end of the third quarter, up from 2.6% for the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations. Our asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside as the forward curve continues to evolve. We expect cumulative loan betas to exceed the positive betas through the rate cycle. Our interest-bearing deposit beta is tracking well within our expectations, and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of Fed rate hikes from here. So far in this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 225 basis points since 4Q '21, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is well controlled at 18% through the end of the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our deposit beta was 26%. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable and stable outlook for NII as we benefit from the higher rate environment. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 23. In the third quarter, we did an additional $10 billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through 2024 and beyond, primarily through forward starting swaps. We expect our NIM to rise to 3.5% or better by the end of 2023 and for our overall hedge position to provide a NIM floor of about 3.25% through the fourth quarter of 2024 if we see rates come down by 200 basis points across the forward curve before it could move higher with further hedge actions. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year. Car fees were strong again this quarter, while capital markets and service charges were stable. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets. M&A advisory fees picked up nicely, but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market volatility. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline to continue to build with strong pinch activity and a growing backlog. While current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close, capital markets fees should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in M&A advisory even more broadly if markets settle down. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes, which more than offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter, but still remain below historical levels. We are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time and servicing operating fees were stable. Wealth fees are $5 million lower linked quarter given the impact of lower market levels on AUM. And in other income, we saw a seasonal benefit from our tax advantaged investments and an increase in leasing revenue. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress and is on track to deliver over $115 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Average loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter driven by 3% growth in commercial with growth in C&I and CRE, given modestly higher loan utilization and slower paydowns. Retail loans increased 1% with growth in mortgage and home equity, offsetting planned runoff in auto. Period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter given higher-than-usual end-of-quarter C&I line paydown, which were generally redrawn after quarter end. On Slide 11, average deposits were up $1.3 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth coming from retail term deposits and Citizens Access savings and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable. Deposit costs remain well controlled. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 38 basis points, which translates to an 18% cumulative beta. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment, and our performance to date is reflective of the investments need to strengthen our deposit franchise since the IPO. Overall, liquidity improved as we reduced our FHLB advances by $2.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, but still very low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans were broadly stable at 55 basis points of total loans. Given the higher risk of recession, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, pre office, leveraged loans and selected nonprofit sectors. At this point, we aren't seeing significant issues emerge. Also, the leading indicators for consumer continue to be stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels. Personal disposable income has declined from stimulus-driven highs but remains above the pre-pandemic 2019 average. Spending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above pre-pandemic levels, while credit card and home equity line utilization are still well below pre-pandemic levels. And retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13. I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see very good credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. While we aren't seeing stress in the portfolio at this point, we increased our allowance by $49 million to take into account an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.41% which is a modest increase from the second quarter. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. However, given the Investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix, we estimate our pro forma day 1 CECL allowance to be approximately 1.3%. The current reserve level contemplates a shallow recession and incorporates the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk term inflation, supply chain issues and return to office trends. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our target range. This, combined with our strong earnings outlook puts us in a position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We have increased our held to maturity portfolio for about 30% of total loans at quarter end which has helped to mitigate the impact of rising rates. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation. Shifting gears a bit. On Slides 15 and 16, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and what's on tap for our businesses in the near term. Since we closed the Investors acquisition in April, we've been executing against a phased approach to the integration. In the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. And since then, we have completed the conversion of mortgage servicing. We also successfully completed the conversion of more than 10,000 Investors' wealth clients, representing about $1.6 billion in assets to our platform. We have a lot more to do, but I'm pleased to say that we are on track to complete the deposit and branch conversions in mid-first quarter 2023. We have included a high-level integration timeline in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we remain on target to achieve our planned $130 million of run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023 of which approximately 70% will be achieved by the end of 2022. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. In the last three years, we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to bank with us. Last week, we announced the next step in that evolution with CitizensPlus, which provides financial rewards, banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized wealth management. This includes Citizens Private Client our new expanded wealth management offering, which will launch by the end of the year. We are fully committed to driving momentum in our wealth business. And as part of the launch, we are hiring more than 200 new financial advisors and relationship managers. We continue to make meaningful strides forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization. Earlier this year, we migrated Citizens Access to a fully cloud native platform, and we launched a national storefront adding mortgage and education refis to the portal. Over the next year or so, we plan to expand our national storefront, adding card and checking first and then Wealth and Citizens Pay. As we add products to the platform, we have an exciting opportunity to build relationships across a growing national customer base. Our vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this modern platform over time, which will be a key change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing upgrades and enhancements. We are also growing our innovative Citizens Pay offering, which is currently at about 160 merchant partners and expanding across targeted verticals. Over the next year, we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique customer direct experience. Moving to the commercial business on Slide 16. Over the past eight years, we've invested heavily in talent and product capabilities in M&A, corporate finance, bond and equity underwriting, FX and commodities and so on. Despite the challenging environment, we remain near the top of the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access capital through the public markets. We have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as well with our coverage. We are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisitions as we target growth in key verticals the JMP acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare, technology and financial services sectors, expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities and DH Capital expands our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, communication sectors, software and next-generation IT services. These businesses are exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen. Moving to Slide 17, I'll walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be up roughly 3%, driven by the benefit of higher rates with a margin rising to the 3.3% to 3.35% range. Average loans are expected to be stable to up modestly as commercial growth is partially offset by order rundown. These are expected to be stable to up modestly. Noninterest expense is expected to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points to 22 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%. And our tax rate should come in at approximately 22%.  With respect to the full year, we continue to track well and expect to beat our full year 2022 guidance across key P&L categories and performance measures. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for full year 2022 in excess of 5%, with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about 3%. We also expect to deliver a full year efficiency ratio of about 57% with the fourth quarter coming in under 54%. And we expect to deliver a full year ROTCE in excess of 16% with the fourth quarter well above both Q3 and our medium-term target range of 14% to 16%. To sum up, on Slide 18, we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment, and we are optimistic about the outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment. Our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular, is well positioned for when markets stabilize. And our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark. We are well prepared for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are playing some offense, executing well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver medium-term growth and outperformance.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, why don't we open it up for some Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : If you could expand a little on your thoughts regarding NII dynamics into next year? I thought the 3.50 year-end '23 margin expectation. That was definitely a highlight. And I think just generally, your comments about loan betas overwhelming deposit betas sort of cumulatively those suggest some confidence that and I should continue to grow after the Fed stops tightening, but I just would love to hear your thoughts on the puts and takes and the additional color you might be willing to add.\nJohn Woods : Yes, sure. So just break it down into two overall categories. You've got the net interest margin dynamic, which is a big driver, and we're messaging that. We expect our net interest margin to continue to rise. I think loan betas in the last cycle for us were up near 60% or so this cycle, we're doing some more hedging. So you could see our loan betas dropping a little bit. The nice part about that is that it provides a downside protection. So you're going to see loan betas in the mid- to -- sort of low to mid-50s. You compare that to a deposit beta, that we previously messaged, would be around 35% or so. Rates have been up 100 basis points since then. I mean you could see our deposit betas may be getting into the upper 30s or thereabouts given -- cumulatively what's going on with rates in the last -- in the recent couple of months. So you take that dynamic and see cumulative loan betas and exceeding deposit betas and that drives names higher. We're also remixing on the loan side into more variable. You're seeing the strength of the multiyear investments on the deposit side playing. And then let's not forget the other aspects of the balance sheet where you've got securities book and that securities book is funded primarily by DDA and some wholesale. And so you can see the front book, back book dynamics really taking hold where you've got securities yields on the front book in the fourth quarter somewhere between 4.50% and 5% with a 2% runoff. And so that's pretty powerful when you've got essentially a strong DDA underpinning what's going on there in the securities book. So those are some of the net interest margin dynamics. If you flip forward to the other side of things where you see our opportunity for continued loan growth, we're -- you're seeing us rotate into more of a variable rate approach, solid opportunities in home equity and other aspects in the retail side. But commercial is -- we're feeling optimistic on the commercial side and that's going to drive loan growth into '23. It will be economic environment dependent. But nevertheless, the underpinning of rising NIMs, I think, is really what gives us the confidence to continue to see that NII improving into '23.\nScott Siefers : All right. That's perfect color. And I guess just with rates having moved so much, just curious about your thoughts on sort of the Citizens Access products. What kind of trends are you observing about sort of the stickiness of those customers? How much is loyal? How much are sort of shopping for rates? And are your tactics at all changing with regards to that product?\nBruce Van Saun : Brendan, why don't you take that one?\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. Thanks. We're seeing some decent growth in Citizens Access. And the digital native customer still existing out there, and it's waking up a little bit as rates have gone up. So we're -- it's been a very, very effective strategy for us. The customers are loyal to Citizens. We're seeing good augmentation from those customers, a very real brand engaged customers. And the customer base is growing. So our balance growth is coming from both sides, new customer acquisition and existing customers bringing us more as we brought rates up. But most importantly, it serves to sort of have an isolated deposit-raising strategy to protect the core bank from needing to bring in rate-sensitive customers into the bank. We're really relationship focused in our core franchise and the combination of the health of our deposit franchise improvement led by DDA and privacy of our customers has been really showing up well. So our deposit betas in consumer are dramatically different than they were in the last cycle. And it's really for both of those points, the turnaround and the health of the customer franchise and the core bank and then the effective strategy of using access both to drive national growth but also to have a much more targeted and isolated way to grow interest-bearing deposits. It doesn't make us reprice our whole book. So we're really pleased with how it's playing out. And Citizens Access is right where we thought it would be, and it's being executed really well.\nJohn Woods : Then the strategic aspects of Citizens Access that over time is just another benefit of that platform.\nBrendan Coughlin : Correct. I think that's what, obviously, we've messaged on these calls before. But the integration of our Citizens Access deposit platform with all of our national lending businesses to make our national platform much more integrated and customer strategic. John mentioned the launch of our new app and our cloud-based migration. We are making really sizable progress on bringing together all of our national capabilities to deepen those relationships as well as just sort of the deposit angle that we launched with a couple of years back.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian : My first question is for you, Bruce. You have teased that your TOP 8 is underway. And as we think about how much you've improved the bank, and John has certainly helped balance sheet and Brendon and Don have helped balance sheet positioning, what is your vision for what Top could accomplish? So we're looking at a bank clearly outperforming the market today, outperforming expectations. It feels like a lot of the big rates of change have been accomplished in the previous 7 plans. So and that's sort of the genesis of the question. What do you envision TOP 8 to accomplish?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Well, Erika, I think when we ended up hitting the TOP 2 and TOP 3, we were getting questions as to how much re-architecture and reengineering of how you're running the bank is left. Is the -- are you now picking the fruit that's really high in the tree. And yes, it was getting higher in the tree. But I think what we've been able to do is exhibit this mindset of continuous improvement that we're not going to be satisfied with how we're running the bank and we're going to look at all aspects in terms of how we're staffed and organized and our vendor relationships and other kind of efficiency new technology deployment to deliver more efficiencies. And so over time, that's just become part of our DNA here. And so we're not going to rest and say, well, we just had another successful result with TOP 7. Let's take a breather, you really can't take a breather because we have investments that we want to fund in our future, the business initiatives that we list on a couple of the slides in Consumer and Commercial, and that requires net investment in CapEx and OpEx and in order to fund those things, having these top programs and finding efficiencies to self-finance those investments and keep the overall rate of expense growth modest is the equation that we've used to drive ROTCE from the 5% when we started at the IPO to 18% levels today. So I think you're going to continue to see us pursue that mindset of continuous improvement and don't be surprised when we have a successful announcement and execution of TOP 8 that there might be even more TOP programs down the road after that.\nErika Najarian : Got it. And just a few clean-up questions. Thank you so much for giving us a lot of color on the ACL. I'm wondering what the weighted average unemployment rate that you assume in the 1.41 ACL today. And just, John, a quick clean-up question to Scott's line of questioning. As we think about the NII dynamics into next year, what are you assuming about deposit growth and deposit mix shift?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. I'll just take the -- the first one is, we're using some fairly conservative assumptions when we set the ACL. So I would characterize it as a moderate recession rather than a short recession. And the unemployment levels get up over 6% is kind of where we've modeled it. So we think we're being fairly conservative, but we reassess that each quarter. So John, I'll hand the deposit question over to you.\nJohn Woods : Yes, sure. And I think some of the trends that you'll likely see into the fourth quarter continue into '23. But I'd say the couple of items I'd highlight are starting with the customer value proposition that you're seeing us continue to invest in. It's been multi-years to build this deposit platform. And in both Consumer and Commercial those investments are coming to fruition and demonstrating themselves that we're continuing to invest. So you're seeing just core deposit growth coming from that. And you heard Brendan and us talk about CitizensPlus as an example of the core growth that we think can give us some unique ability to take some share into '23. Citizens Access and the retail CD arena is a place where we -- we have taken that down close to zero. And so that will come back a bit in that category. Let's not forget New York Metro. We've entered New York Metro and we're starting to see really nice uptake that once we converted HSBC, we're going to convert ISBC in the first quarter in '23. So we suspect that we're going to start to see some lift coming out of that. And then just broadly in commercial, the product and coverage investments that we've been making over the years and continue to make will offset what we're building in what I've just described will offset our expectation, we're going to have some DDA migration as rates rise. So that's built into our outlook and built into the NIM guide that we're going to have some realistic expectations of the migration. So it was just some of the areas I would highlight.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew O'Connor : Some really good detail on credit back in the appendix, Page 24 for retail and 25 on commercial. And obviously, you guys have improved the mix in both areas over the last few years. But are there any signs of weakness within certain kind of customer groups that you could point to? And then like what leading indicators might you suggest that we watch and that you pay attention to.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes, I'll start and then maybe turn it over to my colleagues for some additional color. But Matt, I think what continues to be very positive is that the expectation that things will normalize back to pre-COVID levels continues to be deferred. And so we're only seeing very slow migration in terms of consumer charge-offs and NPAs and delinquencies still kind of better than pre-pandemic period. And I would highlight there that our focus on very high-quality borrowers in these portfolios, super prime and high prime, those folks are still doing pretty well through the current environment and have a lot of liquidity. And so we feel really good about where things sit in Consumer. Similarly, in Commercial, over time we've migrated to lend to kind of bigger companies, so mid-corporate space companies with in excess of 500 in revenues, and they tend to be more diversified and better credits. And so we also see very solid performance metrics across all the things, NPAs and charge-offs, et cetera. On that side, you've got to go to the usual suspects, if you think the economy is weakening, and that would be commercial real estate, leveraged lending. And then maybe certain sectors in non-profit, which we've heightened our monitoring in those areas, but we don't see any smoke at this point. So maybe with that, let me turn it to Don for additional color on.\nDon McCree: Yes, I think you hit it. We've actually activated our downturn playbook, which involves a lot of incremental stressing, a lot of incremental portfolio management and a lot of incremental conversations with clients. I think there's a couple of pieces of good news just supporting the lack of deterioration in credit. One is -- we think management teams going through the pandemic, got incredibly focused on efficiency in their business and they cut costs and they automate it and they built liquidity and the repaired balance sheets and they hedged and they did a lot of things that were prudent from a risk standpoint. So there's a little bit of a buffer, we think, in the portfolio against what could be deterioration if we go into a deep recession. I'd say the thing we're most focused on is the real estate office portfolio given back to work. We've got fully leased office buildings and those leases are running for a couple of years in the future, but we've got lease rolls that we're focused on and whether they're going to renew or not. I think just personally, I guess I was in New York City yesterday, people are back in the office\u2026\nBruce Van Saun : And the other thing is that the high percentage of our office property is A caliber\u2026\nDon McCree : Yes, yes. And then a lot of it's suburban. So it's in the right places. And a lot of it's in places which are in the Southern tier and things like that. So we don't have a lot of San Francisco, for example, where they're going to have -- there's going to be a lot of distress. So MSAs are important in the real estate business. And I think the leverage book is, that you always look at the leverage -- the sponsor leverage for our strategy there, which is high levels of diversification. Our average hold is kind of $10 million to $12 million. So we do a lot of leverage finance, but we distribute 95% to 97% of it. So -- and we're not really seeing any kind of severe stress in the leverage book. So we feel pretty good. And all the early stats, the crit-class ratios, the nonperforming loans, the watch assets, which we have very significant process around, all seem to be in pretty good shape right now, but we're not\u2026 The other thing I'll mention, and John touched on this, we are being incredibly disciplined on new originations. We're really not taking on any new clients right now. We're getting very focused on returns. We're actually commanding a higher level of pricing given the current market environment. So we're watching the front book very carefully also.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. How about you, Brendan?\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. I'd say the health of the consumer is still very, very resilient. Having said that, -- we're doing a lot of the similar things that Don is mentioning, kind of putting in a proactive approach to a potential downturn. So making investments in collections be ready for an inevitable tick in the wrong direction. We're tightening some credit on the margins. We're being incredibly disciplined on where we're lending right now to make sure that the returns are right, and we got real customer relationships, and it's within the risk profile that is within our risk appetite. Having said all that, with what we're seeing kind of out the window today, the consumer is still 20% plus excess liquidity in deposits as a general statement, and charge-offs are still 50% to 60% of the rates that they were pre-COVID, and we're not seeing any meaningful signs of that reinflating. If you look at the overall U.S. the bottom decile or two of the country, you're starting to see that excess deposits burn off and they're living more paycheck to paycheck, which is where they were pre-COVID. We don't over-index on that segment. And so we index much higher. And so we're not seeing a lot of the pain that is potentially happening at the very bottom of the segment in the U.S. flowing through anything in our book. Look, we're seeing some very, very early signs that potentially were at the early days of a normalization. Credit card customers that pay in full each month. That was about 32% of our portfolio pre-COVID. It's now at 41%. It peaked at 42%. So it's down a tiny bit, but it's still significantly better than what was before COVID. So we're starting to see small signs of potentially customers getting to, but I wouldn't say it's accelerating at all. It's still very resilient and significantly healthier than where it was pre-COVID.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala : Just wanted to follow up one on credit. I think if I heard you correctly that your ACL assumes a 6% unemployment rate. Just I mean, I think CECL is still relatively new. I'm trying to understand, absent that unemployment rate expectations going materially higher. Just if you could give us the thought process around drivers of additional reserve build over the coming quarters? Is it the CRE market? Is it home prices? But what I'm trying to get to is unemployment at 3.5%, 6% seems a long ways away. If that doesn't go much higher, what else would drive those reserves materially higher relative to where we ended the quarter?\nJohn Woods : Yes, I'll go ahead and start there. I mean I think that, first, I'd like to just make sure we're reminded. So we've got 141 basis points against the portfolio right now, when you pro forma adjust that for Investors and some other things, you get a day 1 of about 130. So we're 11 basis points over day 1. So that covers a lot. And so we're covering the environment that Bruce described earlier. I think you could -- and he also mentioned a few pockets of areas that we're watching very closely. So we're watching the CRE office space, and we're watching a few sectors on the C&I side. Just reminding that we're not seeing any -- when you look at where delinquencies are, we're not seeing any early signs of any deterioration here. But that could change, and that could change quickly. So we're keeping a close eye on it.  But -- and as things turn, we'll have those areas of concern that we were focused on in the pandemic, which -- most of which got cleaned out and has been improved over time, but those are -- that's the playbook we'll go back to. We'll go back to those areas of concern and take from there.\nBruce Van Saun : I would just add that I think we're feeling pretty good. If you look at a scenario that says we get to a moderate recession and it doesn't get any worse, then the need to actually keep building may lessen from what it was this quarter. I think there was a reassessment, but the Fed is going to have to stay at higher rates, which probably increases the probability of recession a little bit, and that was reflected in going up before basis points. So you'd have to see even greater conviction that we're likely to hit a recession or the Fed is going to go higher with rates, which is going to have more collateral damage for the need to build on the macro outlook. Of course, the other things that contribute to higher provision is loan growth. So if we have loan growth and then I think also as John indicated, if we have a kind of changing view on certain sector risks, we already have overlays, for example, for the things we mentioned. We have kind of reserve built for commercial real estate office. We think that's sufficient, but our view on that could change over time. So I think we're kind of sitting at a pretty good spot now. We'll have to wait and see what happens with the macro forecast in certain sectors and the amount of loan growth that comes through those things would determine whether we have to keep building the reserve and how much. I would say that I think that the concerns that we're going to be building the way we did during the pandemic and oh my gosh, these numbers can be kind of a runaway freight train. We don't see that at all at this point. So I think those fears are overblown. It's probably one of the reasons that's cast a pall over thanks to valuations. But at this point, we don't see that.\nEbrahim Poonawala : That's good color. And just one question, Bruce, on the New York strategy. So once you complete Investors integration first quarter next year, give us a sense of like should we expect like are you adding new bankers? What are the capabilities you're adding to the franchise, just given how huge that market can be in terms of just market share gains, not just for next year, but for the next few years, yes?\nBruce Van Saun : Sure. So I'll start, and then maybe I'll ask Don and Brendan to talk about their businesses. But I think that theory has been that we bring a thoughtful approach to how we bank these markets. We really understand neighborhoods. We understand individuals, and we really tailor advice to situations to where somebody is on their life journey kind of where they reside, et cetera.  And on the corporate side, we also want to be that thought leadership position where we're the trusted advisor to a company as its negotiating its many challenges in trying to achieve growth. And we've been able to stake out that ground successfully in the major cities that we compete in. We do it well in Boston. We do it well in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, some of our other big cities. And so notwithstanding the fact that New York is a relatively crowded and competitive marketplace. We think that our style can be successful in New York. It's going to take a little time. We've bought some good foundational assets. We need to bring our additional kind of culture and approach and bring our broader product set so we can do more for customers and give them more advice and better capabilities, better customer experience, but we think we'll be successful in that over time. So in effect, this is a bet on ourselves. And so far, everything is tracking exactly the way we had expected with little signs of green shoots that we're kind of on to something pretty good.  With that, let me maybe go to Brendan first and talk about the consumer and small business side and kind of where you're making investments and in a view of the future.\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. We're incredibly pleased with start in New York City post the HSBC acquisition. And as John mentioned, too, we've already started some integration with Investors on mortgage and wealth in New Jersey and some of the borrowers in New York. We're hiring. So we're hiring up investment, financial advisors, mortgage loan officers and business bankers. We're also restacking the retail organization and using talent across the board. And so far, it has really paid dividends. The New York market -- and from a branch network standpoint is the most productive market out of any of our markets so far. Early days, which is an incredibly good early sign. And we're getting a lot of customers coming back to us from some of the big banks, including HSBC customers that enjoyed -- that we didn't buy, but enjoyed the location of the people, and we're really starting to see some growth. Typically, when you do a branch deposit deal, you see some deposit runoff to the tune of 10% to 20% in the first year. We're actually seeing the opposite. The underlying retail deposit base is actually net growing in New York right away, we didn't have any attrition post legal day 1. So there's a long way for us to continue to build share and that's early signs, but we're very bullish on what we're seeing so far. And then the Investors franchise, they kind of lead business banking more than consumer and we're excited about that. We think the Investors' capabilities and their distribution can help us accelerate our business banking strategy overall across the franchise. And then when we put our consumer playbook on the investor franchise, we're seeing this big benefit already of HSBC, and they were principally a retail franchise. When we put that on the Investors franchise that didn't have a meaningful retail presence. The difference from what we bought and what we can build over time is even more substantial. So we're very excited about it. There's still a lot to do, but early signs are very positive.\nDon McCree : I would point at three things. One is the ability, as you said, is to deliver a much broader product set into the existing Investors franchise. So greatly expanded treasury services capabilities, for example, the ability to hedge directly for clients, and that's well underway. And we pick up a lot of very good bankers from the investor side. So our workforce kind of quadruples overnight just with the acquisition. Second thing is we're going to benefit on the commercial side from all the branding that Brendan was doing. So the visibility in New York City of branches and advertising and the like is the name recognition is helpful. So we don't have to explain what Citizens is to potential new clients. And we are also hiring. We announced yesterday a new Market Head for New York City Metro, which came from JPMorgan. So we've got a new leader in place in New York, and we're off to the races.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy : First, kudos for a very good slide presentation, you guys gave quite a bit of detail. It's one of the best out there. So John, talking about your hedges that you put into place, Slide 23 gives us a good breakout of what you have in place. Can you share with us -- obviously, it's protecting should rates start to go down, I would assume in late '23 and into '24. What kind of rate environment would work against what you just put into place or what you've had in place and you put more into place this quarter? What kind of rate outlook would that -- this would not really work that well with.\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean, well, let me just start off with I think that the point of getting those hedges on in the third quarter was to allow ourselves to continue to participate in 2023 with rates rising. And so the intent of all of that was to look past this next year into '24 and '25 and say, if in fact, we end up with a lower regime in those years, let's try to find ourselves into a floor that would help maintain the level of ROTCEs that we're trying to achieve. And so we're stabilizing revenues and stabilizing our returns by doing this. Now of course, there's a trade-off. That trade-off is if rates instead of beginning to come down in '24 they were to remain high or go even higher, that would be an opportunity cost. But nevertheless, on an absolute basis, we've got very attractive returns being locked in through this strategy. And I think that's really what we're trying to achieve.\nBruce Van Saun : Gerard, it's tricky. You're trying to find a sweet spot and you're looking at the forward curve and talking to economists, looking at economic forecasts and leaving yourself enough upside participation for high rates, but then also recognizing that they're not going to stay up forever and trying to floor out your downside. And so the time will tell. Hindsight is always 2020. If you went too early or you missed the window, if you had held off another six months because you've gotten better levels. But right now, we feel -- we've done a pretty good job of, as you can see from the results today, we're still asset sensitive. We're still benefiting as rates go up. And now we can sleep at night that we're not going to see ROTCE slide down the pole if rates turn around and go back down.\nGerard Cassidy : Very good. Is it safe to assume all the counterparties or the major global investment banks in these hedges?\nJohn Woods : Yes. Exactly\u2026\nGerard Cassidy : Okay. And then just the second follow-up question. Obviously, you're not an advanced approach bank. And therefore, the AOCI is not an issue with your CET1 ratio, which is the binding constraint for most banks or all banks. When do you think people start to get a little concerned about the tangible common equity ratio, yours are still very healthy. But is there -- do you guys -- I know it's an accounting issue. We all get that. But do you think there will be a concern if to low and do you have any idea what that rate might be? And then second, John, when you accrete the AOCI back into capital as the bonds pay off, do you know about how much will start coming in starting maybe next year in terms of the AOCI coming back into capital?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Maybe I'll just start to say that we did put the TCE to TA ratio into our presentation deck today because we do think it's worth keeping an eye on that. And some folks in the peer group have either have bigger securities portfolio or didn't put as much in HTM and the TCE to TA ratio is sliding quite a bit. Ours is sliding a little bit, but still appears pretty healthy. You could argue that if that's not a regulatory ratio it's not really something to worry about significantly because it will turn around over time. It's just effectively you've got these securities that are going to be earning you less than if you were able to take the cash and reinvest in at today's levels. So anyway, I think we feel good, we're above 6% in historical times. It's kind of been a marker, and I think we can sustain it there. We have about 30% of the overall portfolio in held to maturity, and we'll have to see where rates go. But if they go up a little bit from here, we're going to continue to generate capital, we think we can keep it at pretty healthy levels. John, I'll turn it over for you for kind of the turnaround and the rest of the answer.\nJohn Woods : Yes. Great. And just to supplement the earlier one, I mean we've got our health maturity is around 30% right now, it sort of balances that a little bit from -- to that point as well. As it relates to the -- how the AOCI will come back in, if rates kind of move around on us, just the way to think about it, at September 30 we have about $4.5 billion after tax sitting in that number. And that will come in over about five years. So that gives you an ability to work through that, hopefully, too.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Wilczynski: This is Brian Wilczynski on for Betsy. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the expectation to resume buybacks in 4Q and just some of the puts and takes there. You were just talking about capital a moment ago. Obviously, your reg capital position is quite strong today. But at the same time, the macro backdrop is still a bit challenging. So I was just wondering what makes you comfortable at resuming buybacks at this stage.\nBruce Van Saun : So we are kind of at the north end of our 9.5% to 10% range. And we indicated we would expect to land there at the end of the year. So I think if you look at our target range relative to peers, we've been a little on a conservative side, which I think, has served us well and particularly going into an environment with a significant amount of uncertainty, that's the position we want to be in. Having said that, you can see the level of profitability we have now is very significant. So we're generating a huge amount of tangible equity each quarter, this quarter, next quarter. And so we could certainly blow past 10% if we weren't back in the market buying our stock. So I think there's opportunity for us to even improve that ratio a little further and be in the market buying our stock. The wild card often is the amount of balance sheet growth and the amount of -- are there any acquisitions likely in the near term. And I think on that score, we've given you the guidance for what we see for loan growth. So that's factored in. And then I'd say on the acquisitions, we've really only done very small acquisitions so far this year. We've really been a 100% focus on making sure we're integrating the ones we did last year, we had a pretty better year last year with the New York Metro play and then JMP and DH Capital. And so we focused on integrating. We feel really good about where those are. And so nothing big likely before the end of the year, even just in terms of the fee-based deals that we do. So I think we have the wherewithal to go out and build the ratio a bit further plus get in the market and buy back some stock.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKenneth Usdin : I know we're getting over an hour. So just a quick one, follow up on Gerard's question. So how through the hedging program do you feel like you are at this point that given what you show us on that grid Slide 23, have you kind of done what you need to do, if not, how much more about you think you need to still add to get that asset sensitivity to the position you really wanted to live in?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean I think, this world, there are many things we consider when we work through this. We think about the evolution of the balance sheet where we think rates are going to go, et cetera. But if you look at 3.3%, most of that's on the short end, if you were to say, okay, we know that the Fed's not going to raise rates anymore and you wanted to take that down to neutral, that would mean about $10 billion or $15 billion of additional hedging that would be necessary. And so -- but we're going to be careful and methodical about that and update our balance sheet outlook, update our asset sensitivity, but there's still a significant amount of hedging left to do before we would say that we're done with this cycle.\nKenneth Usdin : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. So John, that point you made in the deck about 4Q '24 NIM floor of 3.25% and down 200 bps. If the Fed does hang high, do you have an idea of what that NIM looks like in a down 100 bps scenario?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean, it's somewhere between the two, right? I mean I think it's somewhere between the two. I mean I'd say that, that would be a better outcome for us. And you could expect that, that will be somewhere between the 3.25% and 3.50% bookends that we gave.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari : On the capital markets side of the business, I know you indicated you expect a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter. Could you help us size that up, how do you think about the magnitude there based upon your pipeline?\nBruce Van Saun : John, we had a little trouble hearing you.\nDon McCree : Yes, I think, I kind of got it, yes. So John, we've got pipelines bigger than we've ever had on our capital markets side. I think it's important to kind of realize that the place we play is middle market and capital markets. So the most troubled spots to generate revenue in capital markets is these very large M&A deals, which require very large financing. And those are what we are struggling with the market. So we were really pleased that we were able to hold cap markets kind of flat quarter-on-quarter, given all the volatility in the market. And we think most of the action is going to come in M&A. We've got a very big M&A pipeline, a lot of which does not require financing. And it looks like it's moving along quite nicely. So it's not going to double, but we think it could go up $10 million, $20 million in the fourth quarter. But we just have to see, as we go through the quarter, how much volatility and what the backdrop is. But we're assuming pretty big discounts to the pipeline in terms of what we're forecasting right now. So we're pretty comfortable that we're going to have a good quarter. And then we do think we'll get a -- we'll do a little better now that the currency and interest rate volatility has calmed down a little bit, that hurt us in the third quarter because people weren't really willing to step into the market and hedge. We think we'll do a little bit better on the market business as also in the fourth quarter.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add, so we don't get carried away with Don's sanguine outlook on commercial fees in Q4. When we look at our total fees at top of the house, we'll probably still see a little leakage on mortgage production. The good news here is that servicing is held up very strong, and so our diversification has paid and lend stability to mortgage, but there's probably a slight additional step to take in Q4. And then we did make some changes in our policies regarding overdrafts where we've done away with NSF fees. And so that would clip the service charges line a little bit. So you probably see some strength in commercial offset a bit with a little fall in the consumer side. But overall, we're guiding to the net of that should still be stable to up modestly. And we'll just have to see how much of the capital markets pipeline, as Don said, actually gets printed.\nJohn Pancari : Okay. Hopefully, you can hear me a little bit better. One last question. Have you sized up the size of the shared national credit portfolio? And then also what percentage of that portfolio are you in the lead position.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. I think the national credit portfolio is a pretty decent size as we've moved up market. But I'd point out a couple of things there is the kind of when you're in shared national credits in general, those are bigger companies that have multi-bank facilities and they tend to be better credits. The second thing is that we continue to migrate towards trying to aim for the left lead position in those shared national credits and/or be one of the book runners or admin agents, so become a meaningful bank to those overall customers. And so that's just been part of our strategy and we're making good traction on that strategy. I think a lot of times investors will think that the shared national credits is a particular point of risk. Our view is that actually that's just part of the strategy, and those are actually good credits. And if you're get to be in the driver's seat of leading the deals, then that's the place you want to be.\nDon McCree: I think that's right. And it's all about return against asset -- against deployment. So underlying the BSO strategy on the commercial side that we talked about in the quarters, we're exiting $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter of under returning assets. A lot of those are shared national credits, which just haven't panned out once we've been a relationship for a couple of years. So that portfolio churns quite aggressively also. And our ability to monetize through the product capabilities that we've built over the last five years is significantly different than it was five years ago, we just got many, many more opportunities to engage and become that lead bank with those clients.\nBruce Van Saun: I think that's the end of the queue on the question. So really appreciate everybody's interest and support. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing Slide 5. We reported underlying net income of $669 million and EPS of $1.30. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.9%. Net interest income was up 11% linked quarter, driven by a 21 basis point improvement in margin to 3.25% and 2% growth in average interest-earning assets. Average loans are up 2% linked quarter, with 3% growth in commercial. Fees were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year and mortgage results softened a bit. Capital markets fees and service charges were stable. We remain highly disciplined on expenses, which are up 1% linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 6% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.9%. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $123 million and a reserve build of $49 million this quarter, which reflects an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.41%, up from 1.37% at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of approximately 1.3%. Our tangible book value per share is down 8.6% linked quarter, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 9.8%, just above the midpoint of our target range. Next, I'll provide further details related to third quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 11%, given higher net interest margin and 2% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.25%, up 21 basis points. As you can see on the new block in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, the healthy increase in asset yields outpaced funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 7. With the current expectation for the Fed to rates further, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII year-to-date and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth quarter and compound into 2023. Our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately 3.3% at the end of the third quarter, up from 2.6% for the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations. Our asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside as the forward curve continues to evolve. We expect cumulative loan betas to exceed the positive betas through the rate cycle. Our interest-bearing deposit beta is tracking well within our expectations, and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of Fed rate hikes from here. So far in this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 225 basis points since 4Q '21, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is well controlled at 18% through the end of the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our deposit beta was 26%. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. We continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable and stable outlook for NII as we benefit from the higher rate environment. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 23. In the third quarter, we did an additional $10 billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through 2024 and beyond, primarily through forward starting swaps. We expect our NIM to rise to 3.5% or better by the end of 2023 and for our overall hedge position to provide a NIM floor of about 3.25% through the fourth quarter of 2024 if we see rates come down by 200 basis points across the forward curve before it could move higher with further hedge actions. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year. Car fees were strong again this quarter, while capital markets and service charges were stable. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets. M&A advisory fees picked up nicely, but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market volatility. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline to continue to build with strong pinch activity and a growing backlog. While current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close, capital markets fees should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in M&A advisory even more broadly if markets settle down. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes, which more than offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter, but still remain below historical levels. We are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time and servicing operating fees were stable. Wealth fees are $5 million lower linked quarter given the impact of lower market levels on AUM. And in other income, we saw a seasonal benefit from our tax advantaged investments and an increase in leasing revenue. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress and is on track to deliver over $115 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Average loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter driven by 3% growth in commercial with growth in C&I and CRE, given modestly higher loan utilization and slower paydowns. Retail loans increased 1% with growth in mortgage and home equity, offsetting planned runoff in auto. Period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter given higher-than-usual end-of-quarter C&I line paydown, which were generally redrawn after quarter end. On Slide 11, average deposits were up $1.3 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth coming from retail term deposits and Citizens Access savings and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable. Deposit costs remain well controlled. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 38 basis points, which translates to an 18% cumulative beta. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment, and our performance to date is reflective of the investments need to strengthen our deposit franchise since the IPO. Overall, liquidity improved as we reduced our FHLB advances by $2.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, but still very low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans were broadly stable at 55 basis points of total loans. Given the higher risk of recession, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, pre office, leveraged loans and selected nonprofit sectors. At this point, we aren't seeing significant issues emerge. Also, the leading indicators for consumer continue to be stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels. Personal disposable income has declined from stimulus-driven highs but remains above the pre-pandemic 2019 average. Spending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above pre-pandemic levels, while credit card and home equity line utilization are still well below pre-pandemic levels. And retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13. I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see very good credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. While we aren't seeing stress in the portfolio at this point, we increased our allowance by $49 million to take into account an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.41% which is a modest increase from the second quarter. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. However, given the Investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix, we estimate our pro forma day 1 CECL allowance to be approximately 1.3%. The current reserve level contemplates a shallow recession and incorporates the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk term inflation, supply chain issues and return to office trends. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our target range. This, combined with our strong earnings outlook puts us in a position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We have increased our held to maturity portfolio for about 30% of total loans at quarter end which has helped to mitigate the impact of rising rates. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation. Shifting gears a bit. On Slides 15 and 16, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and what's on tap for our businesses in the near term. Since we closed the Investors acquisition in April, we've been executing against a phased approach to the integration. In the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. And since then, we have completed the conversion of mortgage servicing. We also successfully completed the conversion of more than 10,000 Investors' wealth clients, representing about $1.6 billion in assets to our platform. We have a lot more to do, but I'm pleased to say that we are on track to complete the deposit and branch conversions in mid-first quarter 2023. We have included a high-level integration timeline in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we remain on target to achieve our planned $130 million of run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023 of which approximately 70% will be achieved by the end of 2022. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. In the last three years, we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to bank with us. Last week, we announced the next step in that evolution with CitizensPlus, which provides financial rewards, banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized wealth management. This includes Citizens Private Client our new expanded wealth management offering, which will launch by the end of the year. We are fully committed to driving momentum in our wealth business. And as part of the launch, we are hiring more than 200 new financial advisors and relationship managers. We continue to make meaningful strides forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization. Earlier this year, we migrated Citizens Access to a fully cloud native platform, and we launched a national storefront adding mortgage and education refis to the portal. Over the next year or so, we plan to expand our national storefront, adding card and checking first and then Wealth and Citizens Pay. As we add products to the platform, we have an exciting opportunity to build relationships across a growing national customer base. Our vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this modern platform over time, which will be a key change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing upgrades and enhancements. We are also growing our innovative Citizens Pay offering, which is currently at about 160 merchant partners and expanding across targeted verticals. Over the next year, we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique customer direct experience. Moving to the commercial business on Slide 16. Over the past eight years, we've invested heavily in talent and product capabilities in M&A, corporate finance, bond and equity underwriting, FX and commodities and so on. Despite the challenging environment, we remain near the top of the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access capital through the public markets. We have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as well with our coverage. We are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisitions as we target growth in key verticals the JMP acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare, technology and financial services sectors, expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities and DH Capital expands our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, communication sectors, software and next-generation IT services. These businesses are exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen. Moving to Slide 17, I'll walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be up roughly 3%, driven by the benefit of higher rates with a margin rising to the 3.3% to 3.35% range. Average loans are expected to be stable to up modestly as commercial growth is partially offset by order rundown. These are expected to be stable to up modestly. Noninterest expense is expected to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points to 22 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%. And our tax rate should come in at approximately 22%.  With respect to the full year, we continue to track well and expect to beat our full year 2022 guidance across key P&L categories and performance measures. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for full year 2022 in excess of 5%, with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about 3%. We also expect to deliver a full year efficiency ratio of about 57% with the fourth quarter coming in under 54%. And we expect to deliver a full year ROTCE in excess of 16% with the fourth quarter well above both Q3 and our medium-term target range of 14% to 16%. To sum up, on Slide 18, we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment, and we are optimistic about the outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment. Our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular, is well positioned for when markets stabilize. And our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark. We are well prepared for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are playing some offense, executing well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver medium-term growth and outperformance.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Yes, sure. So just break it down into two overall categories. You've got the net interest margin dynamic, which is a big driver, and we're messaging that. We expect our net interest margin to continue to rise. I think loan betas in the last cycle for us were up near 60% or so this cycle, we're doing some more hedging. So you could see our loan betas dropping a little bit. The nice part about that is that it provides a downside protection. So you're going to see loan betas in the mid- to -- sort of low to mid-50s. You compare that to a deposit beta, that we previously messaged, would be around 35% or so. Rates have been up 100 basis points since then. I mean you could see our deposit betas may be getting into the upper 30s or thereabouts given -- cumulatively what's going on with rates in the last -- in the recent couple of months. So you take that dynamic and see cumulative loan betas and exceeding deposit betas and that drives names higher. We're also remixing on the loan side into more variable. You're seeing the strength of the multiyear investments on the deposit side playing. And then let's not forget the other aspects of the balance sheet where you've got securities book and that securities book is funded primarily by DDA and some wholesale. And so you can see the front book, back book dynamics really taking hold where you've got securities yields on the front book in the fourth quarter somewhere between 4.50% and 5% with a 2% runoff. And so that's pretty powerful when you've got essentially a strong DDA underpinning what's going on there in the securities book. So those are some of the net interest margin dynamics. If you flip forward to the other side of things where you see our opportunity for continued loan growth, we're -- you're seeing us rotate into more of a variable rate approach, solid opportunities in home equity and other aspects in the retail side. But commercial is -- we're feeling optimistic on the commercial side and that's going to drive loan growth into '23. It will be economic environment dependent. But nevertheless, the underpinning of rising NIMs, I think, is really what gives us the confidence to continue to see that NII improving into '23. Then the strategic aspects of Citizens Access that over time is just another benefit of that platform. Yes, sure. And I think some of the trends that you'll likely see into the fourth quarter continue into '23. But I'd say the couple of items I'd highlight are starting with the customer value proposition that you're seeing us continue to invest in. It's been multi-years to build this deposit platform. And in both Consumer and Commercial those investments are coming to fruition and demonstrating themselves that we're continuing to invest. So you're seeing just core deposit growth coming from that. And you heard Brendan and us talk about CitizensPlus as an example of the core growth that we think can give us some unique ability to take some share into '23. Citizens Access and the retail CD arena is a place where we -- we have taken that down close to zero. And so that will come back a bit in that category. Let's not forget New York Metro. We've entered New York Metro and we're starting to see really nice uptake that once we converted HSBC, we're going to convert ISBC in the first quarter in '23. So we suspect that we're going to start to see some lift coming out of that. And then just broadly in commercial, the product and coverage investments that we've been making over the years and continue to make will offset what we're building in what I've just described will offset our expectation, we're going to have some DDA migration as rates rise. So that's built into our outlook and built into the NIM guide that we're going to have some realistic expectations of the migration. So it was just some of the areas I would highlight. Yes, I'll go ahead and start there. I mean I think that, first, I'd like to just make sure we're reminded. So we've got 141 basis points against the portfolio right now, when you pro forma adjust that for Investors and some other things, you get a day 1 of about 130. So we're 11 basis points over day 1. So that covers a lot. And so we're covering the environment that Bruce described earlier. I think you could -- and he also mentioned a few pockets of areas that we're watching very closely. So we're watching the CRE office space, and we're watching a few sectors on the C&I side. Just reminding that we're not seeing any -- when you look at where delinquencies are, we're not seeing any early signs of any deterioration here. But that could change, and that could change quickly. So we're keeping a close eye on it.  But -- and as things turn, we'll have those areas of concern that we were focused on in the pandemic, which -- most of which got cleaned out and has been improved over time, but those are -- that's the playbook we'll go back to. We'll go back to those areas of concern and take from there. Yes. I mean, well, let me just start off with I think that the point of getting those hedges on in the third quarter was to allow ourselves to continue to participate in 2023 with rates rising. And so the intent of all of that was to look past this next year into '24 and '25 and say, if in fact, we end up with a lower regime in those years, let's try to find ourselves into a floor that would help maintain the level of ROTCEs that we're trying to achieve. And so we're stabilizing revenues and stabilizing our returns by doing this. Now of course, there's a trade-off. That trade-off is if rates instead of beginning to come down in '24 they were to remain high or go even higher, that would be an opportunity cost. But nevertheless, on an absolute basis, we've got very attractive returns being locked in through this strategy. And I think that's really what we're trying to achieve. Yes. Exactly... Yes. Great. And just to supplement the earlier one, I mean we've got our health maturity is around 30% right now, it sort of balances that a little bit from -- to that point as well. As it relates to the -- how the AOCI will come back in, if rates kind of move around on us, just the way to think about it, at September 30 we have about $4.5 billion after tax sitting in that number. And that will come in over about five years. So that gives you an ability to work through that, hopefully, too. Yes. I mean I think, this world, there are many things we consider when we work through this. We think about the evolution of the balance sheet where we think rates are going to go, et cetera. But if you look at 3.3%, most of that's on the short end, if you were to say, okay, we know that the Fed's not going to raise rates anymore and you wanted to take that down to neutral, that would mean about $10 billion or $15 billion of additional hedging that would be necessary. And so -- but we're going to be careful and methodical about that and update our balance sheet outlook, update our asset sensitivity, but there's still a significant amount of hedging left to do before we would say that we're done with this cycle. Yes. I mean, it's somewhere between the two, right? I mean I think it's somewhere between the two. I mean I'd say that, that would be a better outcome for us. And you could expect that, that will be somewhere between the 3.25% and 3.50% bookends that we gave."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes, I think you hit it. We've actually activated our downturn playbook, which involves a lot of incremental stressing, a lot of incremental portfolio management and a lot of incremental conversations with clients. I think there's a couple of pieces of good news just supporting the lack of deterioration in credit. One is -- we think management teams going through the pandemic, got incredibly focused on efficiency in their business and they cut costs and they automate it and they built liquidity and the repaired balance sheets and they hedged and they did a lot of things that were prudent from a risk standpoint. So there's a little bit of a buffer, we think, in the portfolio against what could be deterioration if we go into a deep recession. I'd say the thing we're most focused on is the real estate office portfolio given back to work. We've got fully leased office buildings and those leases are running for a couple of years in the future, but we've got lease rolls that we're focused on and whether they're going to renew or not. I think just personally, I guess I was in New York City yesterday, people are back in the office... Yes, yes. And then a lot of it's suburban. So it's in the right places. And a lot of it's in places which are in the Southern tier and things like that. So we don't have a lot of San Francisco, for example, where they're going to have -- there's going to be a lot of distress. So MSAs are important in the real estate business. And I think the leverage book is, that you always look at the leverage -- the sponsor leverage for our strategy there, which is high levels of diversification. Our average hold is kind of $10 million to $12 million. So we do a lot of leverage finance, but we distribute 95% to 97% of it. So -- and we're not really seeing any kind of severe stress in the leverage book. So we feel pretty good. And all the early stats, the crit-class ratios, the nonperforming loans, the watch assets, which we have very significant process around, all seem to be in pretty good shape right now, but we're not... The other thing I'll mention, and John touched on this, we are being incredibly disciplined on new originations. We're really not taking on any new clients right now. We're getting very focused on returns. We're actually commanding a higher level of pricing given the current market environment. So we're watching the front book very carefully also. I would point at three things. One is the ability, as you said, is to deliver a much broader product set into the existing Investors franchise. So greatly expanded treasury services capabilities, for example, the ability to hedge directly for clients, and that's well underway. And we pick up a lot of very good bankers from the investor side. So our workforce kind of quadruples overnight just with the acquisition. Second thing is we're going to benefit on the commercial side from all the branding that Brendan was doing. So the visibility in New York City of branches and advertising and the like is the name recognition is helpful. So we don't have to explain what Citizens is to potential new clients. And we are also hiring. We announced yesterday a new Market Head for New York City Metro, which came from JPMorgan. So we've got a new leader in place in New York, and we're off to the races. Yes, I think, I kind of got it, yes. So John, we've got pipelines bigger than we've ever had on our capital markets side. I think it's important to kind of realize that the place we play is middle market and capital markets. So the most troubled spots to generate revenue in capital markets is these very large M&A deals, which require very large financing. And those are what we are struggling with the market. So we were really pleased that we were able to hold cap markets kind of flat quarter-on-quarter, given all the volatility in the market. And we think most of the action is going to come in M&A. We've got a very big M&A pipeline, a lot of which does not require financing. And it looks like it's moving along quite nicely. So it's not going to double, but we think it could go up $10 million, $20 million in the fourth quarter. But we just have to see, as we go through the quarter, how much volatility and what the backdrop is. But we're assuming pretty big discounts to the pipeline in terms of what we're forecasting right now. So we're pretty comfortable that we're going to have a good quarter. And then we do think we'll get a -- we'll do a little better now that the currency and interest rate volatility has calmed down a little bit, that hurt us in the third quarter because people weren't really willing to step into the market and hedge. We think we'll do a little bit better on the market business as also in the fourth quarter. I think that's right. And it's all about return against asset -- against deployment. So underlying the BSO strategy on the commercial side that we talked about in the quarters, we're exiting $1 billion to $2 billion a quarter of under returning assets. A lot of those are shared national credits, which just haven't panned out once we've been a relationship for a couple of years. So that portfolio churns quite aggressively also. And our ability to monetize through the product capabilities that we've built over the last five years is significantly different than it was five years ago, we just got many, many more opportunities to engage and become that lead bank with those clients."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We delivered another very strong quarterly result in Q3. Rising rates positively impacted our net interest income and net interest margin. Fees and expenses were broadly stable and credit performance remains excellent. We grew average loans 2% and deposits 1% as our liquidity and funding position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 9.8% is above the midpoint of our 9.5% to 10% target range. Our TCE to total asset ratio sits at 6.1%. Performance metrics include a net interest margin of 3.25% and that's up 21 basis points. We had positive sequential operating leverage of 6%. We had hit an efficiency ratio below 55% and our return on tangible common equity was around 18%. We built our credit reserves by $49 million with our ACL at 1.41%, and that's above the 1. 3% day 1 CECL reserve adjusted for the Investors acquisition. Beyond these impressive financial results, we've continued to make good progress in executing our strategic initiatives. In Consumer, we launched Citizens Private Client, which will help drive wealth opportunities. We migrated our national digital bank to a modern cloud-based platform. We continue to grow share with Citizens Pay, and we're executing well on our expansion into New York City Metro region. In Commercial, we've successfully integrated recent acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital into our coverage and product model. Our M&A pipelines are at record levels and our geographic and industry vertical build-out is delivering strong results in terms of market share gains. Enterprise wide, we're successfully ramping up our TOP 7 program, while building out TOP 8. Stay tuned on that. Our NextGen Tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a game changer for us. These programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement finding ways to run the bank more efficiently so we can deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund investments for our future. We're also doing some interesting things in DSG such as developing a carbon offset program for clients as well as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy, and we have more interesting innovation in the pipeline. As we look forward to Q4 in 2023, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep growing and enhancing our franchise value. We are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. But we also plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our metal and deliver responsible, sustainable growth. One aspect that we emphasize in today's presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base, but we've been able to transform over time. We've had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters, as some peers are seeing outflows, and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack. We're seeing very strong loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through 2024, assuming the current forward curve. As a result, our NIM will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on. We've also layered in sizable net interest rate hedges to protect NIM and ROTCE through 2024 if the Fed reverses and brings down short-term rates, moving off of the zero bound for short rates has unlocked the value of our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our ROTCE. With a clearer macro outlook and less market volatility, we feel the value of our commercial bank build-out will also manifest, benefiting further our ROTCE. So very exciting time for Citizens.  And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John? Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, why don't we open it up for some Q&A? Brendan, why don't you take that one? Yes. Well, Erika, I think when we ended up hitting the TOP 2 and TOP 3, we were getting questions as to how much re-architecture and reengineering of how you're running the bank is left. Is the -- are you now picking the fruit that's really high in the tree. And yes, it was getting higher in the tree. But I think what we've been able to do is exhibit this mindset of continuous improvement that we're not going to be satisfied with how we're running the bank and we're going to look at all aspects in terms of how we're staffed and organized and our vendor relationships and other kind of efficiency new technology deployment to deliver more efficiencies. And so over time, that's just become part of our DNA here. And so we're not going to rest and say, well, we just had another successful result with TOP 7. Let's take a breather, you really can't take a breather because we have investments that we want to fund in our future, the business initiatives that we list on a couple of the slides in Consumer and Commercial, and that requires net investment in CapEx and OpEx and in order to fund those things, having these top programs and finding efficiencies to self-finance those investments and keep the overall rate of expense growth modest is the equation that we've used to drive ROTCE from the 5% when we started at the IPO to 18% levels today. So I think you're going to continue to see us pursue that mindset of continuous improvement and don't be surprised when we have a successful announcement and execution of TOP 8 that there might be even more TOP programs down the road after that. Yes. I'll just take the -- the first one is, we're using some fairly conservative assumptions when we set the ACL. So I would characterize it as a moderate recession rather than a short recession. And the unemployment levels get up over 6% is kind of where we've modeled it. So we think we're being fairly conservative, but we reassess that each quarter. So John, I'll hand the deposit question over to you. Yes, I'll start and then maybe turn it over to my colleagues for some additional color. But Matt, I think what continues to be very positive is that the expectation that things will normalize back to pre-COVID levels continues to be deferred. And so we're only seeing very slow migration in terms of consumer charge-offs and NPAs and delinquencies still kind of better than pre-pandemic period. And I would highlight there that our focus on very high-quality borrowers in these portfolios, super prime and high prime, those folks are still doing pretty well through the current environment and have a lot of liquidity. And so we feel really good about where things sit in Consumer. Similarly, in Commercial, over time we've migrated to lend to kind of bigger companies, so mid-corporate space companies with in excess of 500 in revenues, and they tend to be more diversified and better credits. And so we also see very solid performance metrics across all the things, NPAs and charge-offs, et cetera. On that side, you've got to go to the usual suspects, if you think the economy is weakening, and that would be commercial real estate, leveraged lending. And then maybe certain sectors in non-profit, which we've heightened our monitoring in those areas, but we don't see any smoke at this point. So maybe with that, let me turn it to Don for additional color on. And the other thing is that the high percentage of our office property is A caliber... Yes. How about you, Brendan? I would just add that I think we're feeling pretty good. If you look at a scenario that says we get to a moderate recession and it doesn't get any worse, then the need to actually keep building may lessen from what it was this quarter. I think there was a reassessment, but the Fed is going to have to stay at higher rates, which probably increases the probability of recession a little bit, and that was reflected in going up before basis points. So you'd have to see even greater conviction that we're likely to hit a recession or the Fed is going to go higher with rates, which is going to have more collateral damage for the need to build on the macro outlook. Of course, the other things that contribute to higher provision is loan growth. So if we have loan growth and then I think also as John indicated, if we have a kind of changing view on certain sector risks, we already have overlays, for example, for the things we mentioned. We have kind of reserve built for commercial real estate office. We think that's sufficient, but our view on that could change over time. So I think we're kind of sitting at a pretty good spot now. We'll have to wait and see what happens with the macro forecast in certain sectors and the amount of loan growth that comes through those things would determine whether we have to keep building the reserve and how much. I would say that I think that the concerns that we're going to be building the way we did during the pandemic and oh my gosh, these numbers can be kind of a runaway freight train. We don't see that at all at this point. So I think those fears are overblown. It's probably one of the reasons that's cast a pall over thanks to valuations. But at this point, we don't see that. Sure. So I'll start, and then maybe I'll ask Don and Brendan to talk about their businesses. But I think that theory has been that we bring a thoughtful approach to how we bank these markets. We really understand neighborhoods. We understand individuals, and we really tailor advice to situations to where somebody is on their life journey kind of where they reside, et cetera.  And on the corporate side, we also want to be that thought leadership position where we're the trusted advisor to a company as its negotiating its many challenges in trying to achieve growth. And we've been able to stake out that ground successfully in the major cities that we compete in. We do it well in Boston. We do it well in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, some of our other big cities. And so notwithstanding the fact that New York is a relatively crowded and competitive marketplace. We think that our style can be successful in New York. It's going to take a little time. We've bought some good foundational assets. We need to bring our additional kind of culture and approach and bring our broader product set so we can do more for customers and give them more advice and better capabilities, better customer experience, but we think we'll be successful in that over time. So in effect, this is a bet on ourselves. And so far, everything is tracking exactly the way we had expected with little signs of green shoots that we're kind of on to something pretty good.  With that, let me maybe go to Brendan first and talk about the consumer and small business side and kind of where you're making investments and in a view of the future. Gerard, it's tricky. You're trying to find a sweet spot and you're looking at the forward curve and talking to economists, looking at economic forecasts and leaving yourself enough upside participation for high rates, but then also recognizing that they're not going to stay up forever and trying to floor out your downside. And so the time will tell. Hindsight is always 2020. If you went too early or you missed the window, if you had held off another six months because you've gotten better levels. But right now, we feel -- we've done a pretty good job of, as you can see from the results today, we're still asset sensitive. We're still benefiting as rates go up. And now we can sleep at night that we're not going to see ROTCE slide down the pole if rates turn around and go back down. Yes. Maybe I'll just start to say that we did put the TCE to TA ratio into our presentation deck today because we do think it's worth keeping an eye on that. And some folks in the peer group have either have bigger securities portfolio or didn't put as much in HTM and the TCE to TA ratio is sliding quite a bit. Ours is sliding a little bit, but still appears pretty healthy. You could argue that if that's not a regulatory ratio it's not really something to worry about significantly because it will turn around over time. It's just effectively you've got these securities that are going to be earning you less than if you were able to take the cash and reinvest in at today's levels. So anyway, I think we feel good, we're above 6% in historical times. It's kind of been a marker, and I think we can sustain it there. We have about 30% of the overall portfolio in held to maturity, and we'll have to see where rates go. But if they go up a little bit from here, we're going to continue to generate capital, we think we can keep it at pretty healthy levels. John, I'll turn it over for you for kind of the turnaround and the rest of the answer. So we are kind of at the north end of our 9.5% to 10% range. And we indicated we would expect to land there at the end of the year. So I think if you look at our target range relative to peers, we've been a little on a conservative side, which I think, has served us well and particularly going into an environment with a significant amount of uncertainty, that's the position we want to be in. Having said that, you can see the level of profitability we have now is very significant. So we're generating a huge amount of tangible equity each quarter, this quarter, next quarter. And so we could certainly blow past 10% if we weren't back in the market buying our stock. So I think there's opportunity for us to even improve that ratio a little further and be in the market buying our stock. The wild card often is the amount of balance sheet growth and the amount of -- are there any acquisitions likely in the near term. And I think on that score, we've given you the guidance for what we see for loan growth. So that's factored in. And then I'd say on the acquisitions, we've really only done very small acquisitions so far this year. We've really been a 100% focus on making sure we're integrating the ones we did last year, we had a pretty better year last year with the New York Metro play and then JMP and DH Capital. And so we focused on integrating. We feel really good about where those are. And so nothing big likely before the end of the year, even just in terms of the fee-based deals that we do. So I think we have the wherewithal to go out and build the ratio a bit further plus get in the market and buy back some stock. John, we had a little trouble hearing you. Yes. And I would just add, so we don't get carried away with Don's sanguine outlook on commercial fees in Q4. When we look at our total fees at top of the house, we'll probably still see a little leakage on mortgage production. The good news here is that servicing is held up very strong, and so our diversification has paid and lend stability to mortgage, but there's probably a slight additional step to take in Q4. And then we did make some changes in our policies regarding overdrafts where we've done away with NSF fees. And so that would clip the service charges line a little bit. So you probably see some strength in commercial offset a bit with a little fall in the consumer side. But overall, we're guiding to the net of that should still be stable to up modestly. And we'll just have to see how much of the capital markets pipeline, as Don said, actually gets printed. Yes. I think the national credit portfolio is a pretty decent size as we've moved up market. But I'd point out a couple of things there is the kind of when you're in shared national credits in general, those are bigger companies that have multi-bank facilities and they tend to be better credits. The second thing is that we continue to migrate towards trying to aim for the left lead position in those shared national credits and/or be one of the book runners or admin agents, so become a meaningful bank to those overall customers. And so that's just been part of our strategy and we're making good traction on that strategy. I think a lot of times investors will think that the shared national credits is a particular point of risk. Our view is that actually that's just part of the strategy, and those are actually good credits. And if you're get to be in the driver's seat of leading the deals, then that's the place you want to be. I think that's the end of the queue on the question. So really appreciate everybody's interest and support. Have a great day."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks. We're seeing some decent growth in Citizens Access. And the digital native customer still existing out there, and it's waking up a little bit as rates have gone up. So we're -- it's been a very, very effective strategy for us. The customers are loyal to Citizens. We're seeing good augmentation from those customers, a very real brand engaged customers. And the customer base is growing. So our balance growth is coming from both sides, new customer acquisition and existing customers bringing us more as we brought rates up. But most importantly, it serves to sort of have an isolated deposit-raising strategy to protect the core bank from needing to bring in rate-sensitive customers into the bank. We're really relationship focused in our core franchise and the combination of the health of our deposit franchise improvement led by DDA and privacy of our customers has been really showing up well. So our deposit betas in consumer are dramatically different than they were in the last cycle. And it's really for both of those points, the turnaround and the health of the customer franchise and the core bank and then the effective strategy of using access both to drive national growth but also to have a much more targeted and isolated way to grow interest-bearing deposits. It doesn't make us reprice our whole book. So we're really pleased with how it's playing out. And Citizens Access is right where we thought it would be, and it's being executed really well. Correct. I think that's what, obviously, we've messaged on these calls before. But the integration of our Citizens Access deposit platform with all of our national lending businesses to make our national platform much more integrated and customer strategic. John mentioned the launch of our new app and our cloud-based migration. We are making really sizable progress on bringing together all of our national capabilities to deepen those relationships as well as just sort of the deposit angle that we launched with a couple of years back. Yes. I'd say the health of the consumer is still very, very resilient. Having said that, -- we're doing a lot of the similar things that Don is mentioning, kind of putting in a proactive approach to a potential downturn. So making investments in collections be ready for an inevitable tick in the wrong direction. We're tightening some credit on the margins. We're being incredibly disciplined on where we're lending right now to make sure that the returns are right, and we got real customer relationships, and it's within the risk profile that is within our risk appetite. Having said all that, with what we're seeing kind of out the window today, the consumer is still 20% plus excess liquidity in deposits as a general statement, and charge-offs are still 50% to 60% of the rates that they were pre-COVID, and we're not seeing any meaningful signs of that reinflating. If you look at the overall U.S. the bottom decile or two of the country, you're starting to see that excess deposits burn off and they're living more paycheck to paycheck, which is where they were pre-COVID. We don't over-index on that segment. And so we index much higher. And so we're not seeing a lot of the pain that is potentially happening at the very bottom of the segment in the U.S. flowing through anything in our book. Look, we're seeing some very, very early signs that potentially were at the early days of a normalization. Credit card customers that pay in full each month. That was about 32% of our portfolio pre-COVID. It's now at 41%. It peaked at 42%. So it's down a tiny bit, but it's still significantly better than what was before COVID. So we're starting to see small signs of potentially customers getting to, but I wouldn't say it's accelerating at all. It's still very resilient and significantly healthier than where it was pre-COVID. Yes. We're incredibly pleased with start in New York City post the HSBC acquisition. And as John mentioned, too, we've already started some integration with Investors on mortgage and wealth in New Jersey and some of the borrowers in New York. We're hiring. So we're hiring up investment, financial advisors, mortgage loan officers and business bankers. We're also restacking the retail organization and using talent across the board. And so far, it has really paid dividends. The New York market -- and from a branch network standpoint is the most productive market out of any of our markets so far. Early days, which is an incredibly good early sign. And we're getting a lot of customers coming back to us from some of the big banks, including HSBC customers that enjoyed -- that we didn't buy, but enjoyed the location of the people, and we're really starting to see some growth. Typically, when you do a branch deposit deal, you see some deposit runoff to the tune of 10% to 20% in the first year. We're actually seeing the opposite. The underlying retail deposit base is actually net growing in New York right away, we didn't have any attrition post legal day 1. So there's a long way for us to continue to build share and that's early signs, but we're very bullish on what we're seeing so far. And then the Investors franchise, they kind of lead business banking more than consumer and we're excited about that. We think the Investors' capabilities and their distribution can help us accelerate our business banking strategy overall across the franchise. And then when we put our consumer playbook on the investor franchise, we're seeing this big benefit already of HSBC, and they were principally a retail franchise. When we put that on the Investors franchise that didn't have a meaningful retail presence. The difference from what we bought and what we can build over time is even more substantial. So we're very excited about it. There's still a lot to do, but early signs are very positive."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. There was a lot going on in Q2 with a focus on closing the Investors acquisition and commencing our New York City Metro integration efforts. In addition, the Fed's move to rein in inflation through higher short rates and quantitative tightening put a spotlight on a joint management of our capital, liquidity and funding position as well as our interest rate management. The good news is that we made strong progress on all fronts while posting very good financial results. Our underlying EPS for the quarter was $1.14, that's up 7% from the first quarter and ROTCE was 15.5%. Positive sequential operating leverage was 11.7% on an underlying basis, and that's 6.3%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, our PPNR growth was 45%. Driving these strong results was a significant sequential jump in net interest income of 31%. That's 9% ex-acquisitions as spot loan growth reached 19%, which is 4% ex-acquisitions, and our net interest margin jumped 29 basis points. We are seeing a strong pickup in line utilization in commercial which has afforded us the opportunity to be more selective in lower returning consumer portfolios like mortgage and auto. Our deposit performance was good as period-end deposits, ex-acquisitions, were up 1%. Our fees were relatively resilient, up 2% ex-acquisitions, given the diversity of our fee revenue streams. Higher volatility kept capital markets in check though it benefited FX and derivative product revenue, which hit an all-time high. Wealth continued to grow nicely in the quarter, while mortgage revenue was up slightly. We did our usual fine job on expenses and credit performance continues to be excellent. We continue to see favorable trends in key credit metrics on both the commercial and consumer side. At this point, we feel the second half should hold up well with only gradual normalization in loss rates given the solid positioning of our customers today. We currently expect our solid momentum to continue into the second half of 2022. We will continue to benefit from rate rises. Our fees should remain resilient, and we will benefit on expenses from our acquisition synergies and the TOP 7 program. We project positive operating leverage in Q3 and Q4 with ROTCE moving beyond our 14% to 16% target range.  The market seems concerned about the rising possibility of a recession in 2023 and the potential for much higher credit costs. At this point, we see slower economic growth as the base assumption for 2023 and if there is a recession, we believe it should be shallow and short-lived. We are being highly selective on new loan originations, and we've moved several portfolios to held for sale, largely from investors to optimize our balance sheet position.  We continue to believe our credit performance will be good on a relative basis, should a downturn come. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We have many promising initiatives in flight that we are managing well. We are focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths and where we have a right to win. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver prudent, sustainable growth. We certainly feel up to the challenge.  With that, let me turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing slides four and five. We reported underlying net income of $595 million and EPS of $1.14. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.5%. Net interest income was up 31% linked quarter driven by a 29-basis point improvement in margin and strong loan growth, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Period-end loans were up 19% linked quarter. Excluding loans added by the HSBC and ISCC transactions, loan growth was a strong 4% led by commercial growth of 6%. Average loans are up 19% linked quarter, excluding the acquisitions, average loans were up 3% with 5% growth in commercial. Underlying fees were up 5% linked quarter or 2% excluding HSBC and ISBC acquisition impacts, reflecting the diversity and resiliency of our fee businesses. Our client hedging business had another exceptional quarter, and we delivered record results in Wealth and Card. Mortgage fees were up slightly and capital market fees were down a bit, given continued market volatility. We remain disciplined on expenses which were up 1% linked quarter, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 11.7% linked quarter and that was 6.3%, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions. Our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 58%. We recorded an underlying provision for credit losses, excluding ISBC of $71 million, which reflects continued strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios.  The underlying credit provision for the quarter excludes $145 million for the double count of CECL provision expense tied to the ISBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.37% down from 1.43% at the end of the first quarter. Our tangible book value per share was down 6% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI.  We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.6%, and we have increased our common dividend by 8% to $0.42 a share. On Slide 5, we have provided the HSBC and ISBC contributions to our second quarter results as well as the notable items for the quarter. Also, Slide 21 in the appendix provides a summary of the purchase accounting impacts associated with the ISBC transaction. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for our second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 31%, given higher net interest margin and 17% growth in interest-earning assets, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions. The net interest margin is 3.04%, up 29 basis points, which as you can see on the NIM walk in the bottom left-hand side of the slide shows the benefit of higher rates with a 24 basis point increase related to asset yields reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and improved securities reinvestment rates. There is an 11 basis point benefit from the HSBC and ISBC transactions, largely given the repositioning of the ISBC securities portfolio and the benefit of adding their loans. With rising rates, funding costs reduced the margin 8 basis points, reflecting well-controlled deposit costs. Earning asset yields are up 38 basis points linked quarter, strongly outpacing our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are up only 8 basis points. Moving to Slide 7. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes and the current market expectation for the Fed funds rate to end the year in the 350 to 375 basis points range, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII in the first half of this year, and those benefits will continue to accumulate in the second half of 2022 and compound into 2023. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the top left side of this page, we've provided an estimate of our NII sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the June 24 forward curve. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at about 2.5% at the end of the second quarter. This is down from 7% for the first quarter, reflecting the incorporation of ISBC's NII base and liability-sensitive profile as well as hedging actions taken to stabilize the margin and protect against downside interest rate risks. Our improved NII outlook as well as changes in the balance sheet also contributed to the reduction in asset sensitivity. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $10 million to $15 million a quarter with that balance between the long and short parts of the curve. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity profile, deposit costs as low as they have ever been, and our overall funding profile greatly improved, including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. So far this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 150 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, we are quite pleased with how our deposit franchise is performing with a cumulative beta of about 6%. On a sequential basis for the second quarter, our beta was 11%. This puts us on track for a 35% cumulative beta through the end of this rate cycle if the forward curve plays out as expected. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted solid results, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee businesses. Capital Markets delivered solid results despite continued market volatility impacting the bond and equity markets. We saw M&A advisory and equity underwriting fees picking up a bit, but these were more than offset by modestly lower loan syndication revenue. We continue to see good strength in our pipelines and capital markets fees could rebound nicely in the second half of the year if markets settle down, and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. We once again delivered a record performance in our client hedging business, up $9 million linked quarter, driven primarily by FX as we help clients manage their currency exposures as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. Our interest rate and commodities businesses also performed very well, but were down modestly from record levels in the first quarter. Mortgage fees were up modestly linked quarter given improved servicing income as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Production fees remained under pressure given lower industry origination volumes with rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition continues to pressure margins. However, there are clear signs that the industry is beginning to reduce capacity, which should benefit margins as we head into the second half of the year. We delivered record wealth fees, up 8% linked quarter as rising market interest rates supported customer flows into annuity products. Card fees were also a record given seasonally higher transaction volumes. On slide nine, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter, excluding HSBC and ISBC. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress, on track to deliver $100 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Period end loans on slide 10 were up 19% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the ISBC transaction, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions, loan growth was 4% with strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 6%, led by C&I as we emphasize strong relationships to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Retail loans were up 1% as we continue to be more selective in consumer lending. Average loans were up 19% linked quarter or 3% excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions with 5% growth in commercial led by C&I and 1% growth in retail. In commercial, we continue to see strength in corporate banking originations across every region. Line utilization continued to rebound with an increase of about 300 basis points to 39% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking with the largest quarterly increase in utilization we have seen since early in the pandemic. Our clients are continuing to use their lines to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and some are also looking to pro rata bank financing as an alternative to the volatile bond markets. Comparing with the ISBC acquisition, we identified certain non-strategic loan portfolio totaling $2.1 billion, which we are in the process of being marketed for sale. These loans were classified as held for sale at quarter end. This will free up capital and enable our relationship bankers to focus on more desirable commercial relationship business in New York Metro. On slide 11, our period-end deposits were up 13% linked quarter as we added $19.8 billion of deposits from the ISBC transaction. Excluding ISBC and HSBC, period-end deposits were up slightly, while average deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonal runoff on a decline in commercial surge deposits. Moving on to slide 12. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were at 13 basis points, down six basis points linked quarter. Non-performing loans fell six basis points to 54 basis points of total loans linked quarter, driven by improvements in C&I, residential real estate, and home equity. Other credit metrics continued to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans as a percentage of the commercial portfolio are stable after incorporating ISBC, but down on a standalone basis. On Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see excellent credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. We added to the reserve this quarter to take into account strong commercial loan growth as well as the addition of ISBC. While we aren't seeing any signs of early stress in the portfolio at this point, our allowance takes into account the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic outlook, given the Fed's rate actions to combat inflation. Our overall coverage ratio was 1.37%, which is a modest decline from the first quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our retail portfolio and the addition of the ISBC's CRE portfolio, which includes a sizable multi-family component with lower reserve requirements than our legacy portfolios. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. To put our current coverage ratio in context, we estimate our pro forma coverage ratio would be slightly lower than the 1.37% level today if we applied our current portfolio mix, incorporating ISBC to our day one CECL approach. Importantly, our coverage of non-accrual loans strengthened 256%, up from 238% in the first quarter. We feel good about the improvements to the loan portfolio we've made over the past few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.6%. Following the release of the Fed's DFAST stress results last month, our Board increased our common share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. And today, we announced an 8% increase in our common dividend to $0.42 a share. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit. On Slide 15, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of ISBC at the beginning of April, and we are very focused on a successful integration. I am proud of the work our teams have done related to the acquisition. We onboarded more than 1,600 new colleagues through our HR systems on day one, and in the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. We have a number of conversions planned over the remainder of the year, and we are on track to finish in the first quarter of 2023. We have included a high-level integration time line in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we are on target to achieve $130 million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023, of which approximately 70% will be achieved by year-end 2022. The total represents about 30% of ISBC's 2021 expense base. Also, ISBC integration costs to be incurred through 2023 are now expected to come in below the estimated level of deal that you announced. We recently released our fifth annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights our progress on ESG initiatives. The report highlights a number of significant milestones related to our sustainability efforts, including our progress towards targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also announced that we've joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, which will accelerate our efforts to measure and disclose finance emissions. Later this year, we'll release our first TCFD climate report, which will describe our climate strategy in more detail. The report also describes our commitment to the communities we serve, and there are a few recent examples here on the slide with some of the community partnerships we are engaged with in Boston and most recently in Chinatown and Queens, New York.  On the consumer side, we are excited about continuing our expansion in Florida with the opening of our latest Wealth Center in Naples. We recently released a mobile app version of Citizens Access, which we think will be very popular with our customers. And we are very proud that our Citizens Pay point-of-sale offering was awarded Best Innovation by the Banking Tech Awards. Lastly, our relentless focus on customer service, driving results as our ATM channel moved up eight places in the J.D. Power rankings.  On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner. The diversification in our business model is delivering results with record revenue in our client FX hedging business. We also closed the DH Capital acquisition this quarter, strengthening our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, software and next-generation IT services and communications sectors.  On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. Mobile active users are up over 20% year-over-year. Digital deposits and Zelle transactions are up over 30%, and we are seeing great success with the customer uptake of automated client service through virtual chat sessions. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction.  Moving to Slide 16. I'll walk through the outlook for the third quarter. Since we closed ISBC at the beginning of the second quarter, our third quarter outlook includes all our recent acquisitions. We expect NII to be up 5.5% to 7%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. We are very focused on optimizing capital deployment.  In consumer, we will reduce originations in mortgage, auto and education refi, while seeking to grow in home equity, in school education and Citizens Pay and Card. In commercial, we expect to see further increases in-line utilization, but we'll be mindful of balancing growth and returns given current macro uncertainty. These are expected to be broadly stable though upside exists, if capital markets stabilize.  Noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately 1%. We expect to continue strong sequential positive operating leverage in the third quarter and ROTCE above our medium target range of 14% to 16%. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land around the midpoint of our operating range at 9.75%. And our tax rate should come in a bit lower at approximately 22%.  With respect to full year results, we expect PPNR to be in-line with our April guidance. From a revenue standpoint, we are seeing higher NII given net interest margin, reaching approximately 3.25% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher rates and loan growth within our 20% to 22% guidance range. This will be offset by lower key revenue largely in capital markets and mortgage. Expenses will be well controlled, which will result in full year operating leverage of at least 400 basis points and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio of sub-55%. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to come in lower than we guided in April, given continued favorable trends.  To sum up on Slide 17. This was a very solid quarter and we are optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We are off to a running start in New York with the close of our two acquisitions there, and we expect significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment and strong and commercial loan growth. The strength and diversity of our fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize given strong pipelines. We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities and building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.  Your first question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead please.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi, there.\nJohn Woods: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: Just on the loan front, I guess it's also a credit question. I know you indicated that you're being more selective in select areas of consumer lending. Can you maybe give some color there in terms of what areas are you becoming more selective, what you're seeing that's making you become more selective, or is it just actually the broader backdrop? And what that could mean for growth in the consumer portfolios? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. Well, let me start, and then I'll go to Brendan and then John, I'm sure might want to chime in. But I think we have the potential to continue to grow in consumer maybe at a faster pace than would be ideal in the current environment. So we're seeing a lot of growth right now on the commercial side line utilization picking up. And I think in light of the environment that we're seeing out there and transitioning in the investors' balance sheet, just making sure we're focusing on allocation of capital to the highest and best uses and not putting a strain on deposit growth as we're going through this higher rate environment is the game plan at this point. So when we look into the consumer world, clearly, mortgages and auto are areas where we've seen a lot of growth over the past couple of years. We're going to basically put mortgage more on a stable path and start to reduce our originations in auto. Those are really return costs. It's a return on capital cost where we think we have opportunities to grow in areas that deliver better returns would be things like HELOC, like the in-school student and then also card and Citizens Pay. So I think overall, we'll still see some net modest growth, but we're going to take some pluses and some minuses here and really be focused on capital allocation. So with that, Brendan, do you want to add to that?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah. I guess just strategically, what I'd add is I think this is a natural pivot point for the journey of our strategy. We're at the early stages of our IPO, everything was accretive for the most part. And so we've really scaled up our business. And I believe we have one of the most well run and diversified consumer lending franchises amongst our peer set for sure. And if we enter this next phase of our journey, capital allocation is king, and we're making some strategic pivots. I'd also say, this is not necessarily brand-new news. If you recall, prior to COVID, we had already started signaling we were going to start to put auto, as an example, on a path to reduce and get back into tier levels for concentration. And through COVID, we found some great vintages of returns and market disruption. So, the benefit of the diversity of our business model allowed us to flex up through COVID and now we're sort of returning to our original glide path down of auto, given that -- the auto business is naturally in sort of steady state, a lower return and less relationship focused. And then to Bruce's point on mortgage, we've been outgrowing the Citizens balance sheet on mortgage growth for quite some time. And so we would like for that to grow no faster than the rate of the bank, just given where we're at right now on interest rates and a long duration nature of that business. And so really making sure we're protecting our balance sheet for long duration for real relationship focused lending and customers is key. The other place we're curtailing a bit is some fintech partnerships that we've had over the years that served us well and added operating leverage allowed us to invest back in the bank, but being much more relationship focused and our capital allocation is king. But we're very excited, as Bruce pointed, about a couple our places of our franchise. HELOC being one, where we believe we're the number one originator in the US for HELOC origination. Credit quality is extremely good as super prime as it gets, 780 FICO, six year LTVs and we're poised to capitalize on that. And the in-school student product, as Bruce pointed out, is coming back strong as the effects of COVID wear off a little bit on student enrollment and then Citizens Pay, we do have aspirations for medium-term growth in that product. So, I think we're well-positioned. We can flex up. We're not taking down muscle mass, just making some capital allocation decisions as we optimize the balance sheet.\nBruce Van Saun: I think we said a lot, John, anything to add Okay. I think we're good.\nJohn Pancari: All right. Thank you for that. And then just separately on credit again. Just I know you had indicated in your outlook that you do expect some economic slowing as you look into the rest of this year into 2023, but also that your reserve does consider a degree of that. How do you think about what you could potentially see to begin to build the reserve more meaningfully here? And if that does take hold, where do you think that reserve could traject over time? What do you think is a fair level given your economic outlook?\nBruce Van Saun: I'll kick off and hand it quickly to John. But one of the things we pointed out was that we're about where the day one reserve would have been had we incorporated Investors into those numbers. So, this 1.37 ratio. It's down from 1.47. But if you look at the shift in some of the asset composition, we're about at day one. And we have incorporated a Moody's scenario that does have a GDP slowdown and higher recession risk into that scenario. So, I would say, absent a meaningful change in outlook that we could probably hang around this neighborhood for a while. So, anyway, that would be my top of the house view. But John, for more detail, please?\nJohn Woods: Yes, sure. I mean I think that's right. I mean I think our base scenario this quarter really relies predominantly on a mild recession, which would last into sort of into next year. So, I think we're covering that part of it. We even layered in certain aspects of the portfolio a more severe recession. That's also built into where we are. And to Bruce's point, the mix shift in our portfolio has been extremely positive over the last couple of years. So, when you fast forward from the first quarter of 2020, the beginning of 2020 to the -- here in the second quarter of 2022, our mix profile is just much better. And so you can almost think about the fact that we're sort of back to the beginning where we have some uncertainty and some negative scenarios priced in. And without a significant deterioration in the macro as Bruce indicated, we're lucky to be in this range as you get into the end of the year.\nBruce Van Saun: And I think it makes sense. If you just step back and think about the consumers in really good shape, still has a lot of liquidity. Companies have refashioned their business models coming out of COVID. They're all in pretty good shape and contending with inflation and supply chain and trying to maintain their margins. So, historically, if you have a good jump-off point, you go through a shallow recession, bank charge-off rates don't go up all that much. So I think you'd have to see a meaningful change in outlook for us to come off that view.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. All right. Thanks, Bruce. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead please.\nScott Siefers: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just some additional thoughts on how you see deposit cost pressures play out. I think we can get a pretty good sense from Slide 7, how you see the full year sort of trajecting and was glad to see you reiterate the 35% through the cycle beta expectation. But as we look through the remainder of the year, where specifically do you see the pressures that get you to the 25% to 30% by year-end. And then maybe if you can flesh out your thinking on deposit cost dynamics once the Fed stops raising rates?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll take that. I mean, I think the best way to describe that. I mean, we articulated that our cumulative beta 6% through the second quarter, better than we expected. So we're feeling good about where we're starting off this rate cycle. Our outlook indicates a deposit beta getting into the 25% to 30% range by the end of the year, which implies the sequential betas in the second half in quarters being around mid-30s. So that's how that math would play out. So that's how that trajectory would work. The drivers of that are predominantly on the commercial side of the business, but as expected, consumer and retail deposits are incredibly well performing and well behaved in terms of deposit betas, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. We have a little bit of room on the balance sheet for Citizens Access. And all of that has been incorporated into our outlook for the 25% to 30% by the end of the year and for the approximate 35% through the whole cycle. Deposit betas will continue to rise as you get into 2023, and that's the difference between the approximate 35 and the 25 to 30 that we're talking about. And they tend to continue to rise when the Fed stops, assuming that the Fed doesn't start easing immediately thereafter, right? So the last cycle, we had the Fed end of the cycle over the next quarter, we were easing. And so that sort of clipped off the lag effect that you would typically see in deposits. But if the Fed stops and stands at then you would see deposit costs continue to rise for another quarter or two after the last Fed hike. But I should hasten to add that that there's the loan beta side of this equation. And the loan beta side of it is loan betas basically are rising, and they will continue to rise into the Fed tightening cycle and even after the Fed stops and our, in particular, all the tailwind from some of the term fixed lending that often really gain steam when you get to the end of the Fed tightening cycle, that's really what continues to drive net interest margin rising which we would say, would continue to rise throughout '23 even as the Fed continues to rise, given the fact that loan betas would exceed deposit betas.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. That's great color. And I guess along those lines of, sort of more all-encompassing rate sensitivity. So, I guess you're a little less asset sensitive now with ISBC in there. I think a couple of moving parts with the hedging. How would you say your overall rate sensitivity changes from here or is this sort of, kind of a good steady state for where we're at now?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me jump in. It's Bruce, and I'll give it back to John. But I think what we've tried to do, Scott, is find that sweet spot where we still have asset sensitivity sufficient to participate, if the Fed has to keep going beyond what's expected. But also, we like this level of NIM and this level of NII. And so, if in fact, a recession is in the offing and then rates turned down, we've locked in a fair amount of that NII for a good period of time. So just trying to get that balance right where we take away the downside and allow ourselves to continue to participate in the upside is, where we try to land it over the quarter. John?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I agree with that. And the \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I guess the point is that, without management actions as you think about how the balance sheet unfolds from here. A big decline in the quarter really was just pulling in ISBC, just the base NII alone, reduces your assets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you just have a bigger base on that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from that percentage to be calculated. But so that was the source of the decline primarily and our management's actions. So, if you don't -- if you take away management's actions looking forward, actually, our asset sensitivity would tend to begin to rise again.  As mentioned earlier, the rotation out of consumer lending into a lot of the consumer commercial lending. And even within consumer lending, the fact that HELOC is a big driver, which is a floating rate product. You really are reestablishing asset sensitivity as things \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as the balance sheet unfolds in the coming quarters, all of that is absent management's actions, right? And so, that's really going to tell the tale about where we land things.  If we get towards the end of the year, it -- and if rates are inflation still remains stubbornly high, that will tell us where we take the balance sheet under that scenario. If it feels like June was peak inflation, as you get to the end of the year, you would see us wanting to lock in a little bit more. So, we'll just see how it plays out. But naturally underpinning the balance sheet is some upward lift on asset sensitivity.\nScott Siefers: All right. Perfect. Kristin, John, thank you guys very much.\nJohn Woods: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead.\nPeter Winter: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question regarding the deposits. But can you just talk about how you're thinking about deposit growth in the second half of this year versus the second quarter?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I think the -- you've got a big driver being commercial, right? And there's two drivers there. One is, the fact that there was some surge in the commercial business that has been running off. And frankly, most of that's been run off by the end of June. It's down to a relatively smaller level now and that was a driver -- also a driver is the natural seasonality of our deposit flows, which tends to have 2Q as one of the lower points during the year.  So, when you think about through the rest of the year, they'll be the broad continuing to execute against all the investments we've made over multiple years in driving consumer deposits and also the natural uplift and frankly, driving commercial as well. But the natural uplift at the second half tends to deliver in the commercial side of the business from a seasonality standpoint and lower drag from surge runoff. So that's how we see the second half playing out.\nPeter Winter: And how much is in...?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, just to make that clear. So the net would be -- we'd be expecting to resume growth in the second half. And I think that would be led by commercial growth, but consumer also would expect to see some growth as well.\nPeter Winter: And you gave some color on the moving parts on loans in the third quarter going to be led by commercial. But I'm just wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific on the type of growth rates you're expecting on commercial versus consumer and maybe line utilization in the third quarter?\nJohn Woods: Yeah. Well, I mean I think the -- in the second quarter, just talking about the jump off here, maybe helpful because in the second quarter, we had -- on the commercial side of the house, we had 5% average growth. But on a spot basis, we had 6% growth. So you can see that what that implies is that you're likely to see commercial be a big driver in the second quarter. So you're -- you see.\nBruce Van Saun: In the third quarter.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. I'm sorry, in the third quarter. Sorry, yeah, you see commercial being a big driver into the third quarter. I think you're going to see puts and takes in consumer where you see home equity and some of the other categories that we like to see drive things in card and a little bit of mortgage driving it maybe being offset by auto and student a little bit. So that's how I would articulate it. Utilization continues to increase, but it's been about 50-50 utilization and other commercial growth. And so I suspect that, that will be the color into 3Q as well, utilization driving about half of it and the other half coming from outside of utilization. But again, I'd say 3Q driven primarily by commercial loans, maybe a similar amount of the loan growth percentage that you saw in 2Q.\nBruce Van Saun: And one thing about commercial, and maybe I could ask Don to comment on this is that when you kind of look at how companies are able to access new financing, right now, the public markets are pretty still in the water. So you've seen kind of more opportunities for the institutional market as well. So the bank syndicated lending market has seen an uptick, which I think is likely to continue as we look out into the second half. So Don, maybe you want to give some color on that.\nDon McCree: Yeah. I think that's right. And just to put a point on what John said, we've got utilization up by about another 200 basis points across the C&I books and the Global Markets books in the third quarter. So that gives us a couple of billion dollars in potential outstandings. To Bruce's point, we're really starting to see the acceleration of a trend of companies that might want to refinance in the bond market coming to the bank market instead because the access on bank balance sheets is so much more attractive. And we're also seeing some transitory financing for M&A transactions and for maybe some buyouts coming more onto the bank balance sheets as opposed to some of the non-bank lenders. So I don't know what the exact mix will be, but there's a lot of things that are beginning to materialize. And it's not going to all go up because of that. We're going to take some other portfolios down and slow down some other things, similar to what Brendan said, what we've been doing for two or three years now just to change the mix of what's on the books. So, get a little more selective in terms of both returns of the capital we're deploying, but also being very careful of credit risk and the like, just in case we go into a little bit deeper slide. So, we're just being protective of the risk front also.\nJohn Woods: Yes. And one other thing, maybe just to close out there a little bit is to broaden it out to the second half. I think we mentioned -- in fact, there's a lot of moving parts here. And so we tried to really make it clear that our April guide had a 20% to 22% range of loan growth associated with it for the year and where basically -- all of these moving parts are going to fall into that range of the 20% to 22% loan growth increase in 2022. And hopefully, that's helpful. And how it shakes out between 3Q and 4Q, there's a lot going on there, but we're expecting to deliver as we indicated we would in our last guide.\nPeter Winter: Got it. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning Bruce, good morning John.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nJohn Woods: Hey Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bruce, you guys have done a good job on credit, and you've identified the outlook as being healthy, strong possibly at the end of the year, but a little more cautious as we go into next year, which is completely understandable. Can you share with us what you guys are thinking about not so much the traditional credit areas like consumer lending, home equity, or student loans, but more from a institutional market if the Fed pursues this quantitative tightening, which they claim they will $95 billion a month, what kind of disruption are you guys kind of looking at possibly that could happen separate from the traditional unemployment rates going up and all that stuff, I think most of us can understand that. But the new part is this quantitative tightening that we really have inexperience. How are you guys kind of thinking about that going forward?\nBruce Van Saun: Well, we're a bit in uncharted waters because we haven't seen quantitative easing to the extent we have and now the amount of tightening that the planning is going to be interesting to watch. I mean if I step back and think about where did a lot of that additional liquidity end up, I think the biggest banks took on a lot of it, the custody banks took on a lot of it. And I think when we view our space, the super-regional space, maybe we had some benefit from it, but a lot of it was just working on our playbook to deliver better for customers and establish whole relationships where we can capture the deposit opportunities that we were probably sub-optimized on both on the consumer side and the commercial side. So, I think the tightening process, you probably see it most impact the folks where the liquidity ended up, which would, in my view, be the bigger banks and the custody banks. In a bank like us, we still have a number of initiatives where I think we're not fully optimized in terms of the deposits per our relationship base, and we're going to continue to go try to gain market share and grab that.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And can you think about it also from the loan side? Do you think that the QT could have some type of impact. Obviously, it's going to take liquidity out of the market, but I don't know how you guys think about it in terms of maybe some of the syndicated business that you've been doing quite successfully in the past.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I guess I'm not -- I don't necessarily think that will be a huge driver in the loan volumes. I think the level of GDP growth and that spurs activity in the animal spirits and people wanting to put money to work. I think that's a bigger driver. But maybe on that, I'll defer over to Don. If, Don, you have any thoughts?\nDon McCree: Yes, I'm not -- Gerard. I'm not too worried about the loan syndication piece. And again, volumes are much lower than they were, and I think they'll -- it will be where the action is, but the mega deals seem to be struggling a little bit. So if you think about the environment we're, the biggest challenge we have on transactional execution is larger transaction and then clearing through the marketplace. And so I think you'll see a little bit of a dearth there. That's not really the business we're in. So I don't think it will affect our business. And then the other thing is you think about what's the price action that goes on in the securities market as the Fed is a seller versus a buyer. And I think one of the things that I'm looking at is the maturity ladder for corporate bonds and particularly high-yield bonds is relatively light for the next couple of years because everybody took advantage of the low interest rate environment of a couple -- over the last couple of years in refinance and push those maturities out. So I think we have some time for the market to adjust in particularly the public market to adjust to QT trend that we're going to see.\nGerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question. You guys put aside $2.1 billion, I think, of loans from Investors holding it for sale. Can you kind of give us a description of what types of loans? And you also indicated that your criticized loans on a standalone basis went down, which is good, of course. But they were stable when you included the investors criticized loans. Are any of the criticized loans for investors in the $2.1 billion held for sale?\nJohn Woods : Yes. The biggest driver of that book is an equipment finance book, which is about half of it. And there are some non-accruals that -- and non-pass assets that did go into that portfolio. But more importantly, we think our underlying fundamentals with respect to the criticized being stable was a very good outcome. There are -- you've got some criticized coming out of ISBC with not a lot of loss content, and that's just a mechanism of migrating from the state chartered approach to how you manage that kind of stuff to an OCC-managed approach. So that was the impact there, but lost content quite low. And on an ACL basis, pound per pound, the needs from an ACL perspective are actually lower in the ISBC side of things, given that profile that came over. So we're feeling pretty good about that.\nGerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you fellas. Thank you.\nJohn Woods : Sure.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. Just taking a step back, you guys have done a great job giving us exclusive detail in terms of what you're expecting underneath that NII outlook, I'm just wondering if we could talk about it more strategically, given how much the bank has changed since the last interest cycle. So Bruce, in the last interest rate cycle, you took advantage of putting forth great offers through Citizens Access. And I'm wondering, as you think about the composition of your balance sheet now, especially after investors, how should investors think about this go-forward Citizens deposit-gathering strategy? How aggressive are you going to be in terms of competing in rate? And is there room to lower some rates in the acquired portfolio from investors on the deposit side that would allow you to be maybe slightly more aggressive on the rate side on the Citizens Access front?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass the baton here to maybe Brendan and John. But I'd say, we feel really good about the progress we've made in just reformulating the deposit base, both in consumer and in commercial. So, in consumer taking a much more relationship orientation and not having that kind of thrift like lead with rate orientation that we kind of inherited when we got here.  And so, you can just see the results of that in terms of the noninterest-bearing growth, the affluent household growth, the stickiness of the deposits and the size per household going up. So, all those trends are terrific and I think they continue. So that's a cornerstone of the deposit strategy going forward.  I think we have been pretty astute in setting up Citizens Access and giving ourselves a kind of narrow swim lane to go after interest-sensitive deposits and compete for those. I don't think that, that's ever going to really become outsized relative to the overall mix. I think it's good to have and it's -- when we need incremental deposits, we can play with the rate, we can bring them in, but it serves its purpose.  Ultimately, if we get the national bank to where we want to get it, maybe some of those deposits will be a little rate sensitive as we try to get full wallet relationships with some of the national customer base. And then on commercial, again, I think we weren't as aggressive in seeking the operating accounts as we've been over the last few years and certainly seen a lot of growth there.  And then we didn't have the full range of capabilities things like escrow services and other services that different segments of the customer base need, we weren't competitive. They weren't built out and so, we've now built those out. And so, I think our whole speed and deposit growth going forward can continue to be reasonably strong. And hopefully, we'd like to get it growing faster than kind of the peers, which would give us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of loan growth that we can find while maintaining an LDR in kind of the mid to upper 80s. So that's a little bit top of the house thought process around that. But Brendan, maybe you could add something on the consumer side.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. I mean, on the consumer side, I'd say the last up cycle for rates was a bit of perfect storm for us for higher betas. We had a business model, as Bruce pointed out, it was more thrift-oriented, had higher promotional balances. We're growing loans materially faster than peers. So, we had to fund up the loan growth with \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on a base that was a little bit less healthy than peers.  And then we did \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we hadn't fully built out all of our capabilities in the bank. So, as I stare at consumer right now, I look at all of those dynamics, the underpinning health of the portfolio has remixed materially to low-cost deposits and that's based on just increased primacy and engagement with customers that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long-term value creation, and that continues to improve quarter-over-quarter, quarter-over-quarter. That's allowed us to bring our elastic deposits down.  So last up cycle, we had something like $17 billion to $18 billion in promotionally priced elastic deposits, that's now in the mid-single digits in the core bank, putting aside Citizens Access. So the portfolio is mixed from the mid-40s percentages on low cost to -- into the 60s. That's a big buffer for better beta performance. We still believe the consumer segment will have a 25% to 30% net improvement rate cycle of rate cycle in betas. The other things we've done is we've built a lot of tools and capabilities. So Citizens Access is now something we're very good at. But that's not it. We've built a dramatically different product composition in the core bank. We've built highly sophisticated analytic capabilities with better targeting. So we do think we can go and very targeted raise deposits in the core bank, but with a much more precision than we did in the past, which will really mute the beta impact in consumer and allow us where we need to get deposit growth. We can contain it in Citizens Access. Last point I would make is inside the Citizens Access, we are starting to see some green shoots of deeper relationships beginning to form. So it's not just this contained deposit raising mechanism on the side. And that's going to benefit both betas but also cost. And so we're doing some tests to drive Citizens Access deposit raising across our national mortgage customers and our national student loan customers. Early results have been quite positive as we started to raise rates, and that's going to make it much more affordable for us to drive those deposits on the expense side, not just the beta side. So a lot of improvements in the health of the franchise. I would suggest the consumer bank is in a dramatically different position right now than we were five, seven years ago.\nBruce Van Saun: Great answer, Brendan. Don, do you want to add anything?\nDon McCree: Yeah, I'd say similar to Brendan, I mean we basically did not have a liquidity and deposit group seven years ago when we started our journey here and our payments business was fundamentally subscale and subpar. So we're getting a good lift on the payment sales in the core operating business, as you said, Bruce, which is bringing some deposits with it. And our -- just our analytics and our capabilities, not to mention the product suite that we've begun to develop is just in a completely different place. So it's a much stronger relationship pull with the client base. As the client base grows, there's more opportunity to bring in deposits. So we feel very confident in terms of the deposit franchise at the moment.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. You're getting the whole team here, Erika, but that's a good question, obviously. But just to your other point on investors, I'd say that given our history, I think we're particularly well placed to embark upon that migration of that deposit base as well. And we'll be getting that process. We closed this quarter, and we've already begun to run our playbook through this rising rate cycle where we're lagging rate on that platform, which otherwise might not have been lagged and et cetera, et cetera. And so we're making the investments necessary. So we're optimistic that we'll begin to see some benefits coming out of that, which was also part of your question.\nErika Najarian: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We'll next go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks guys. Good morning. Just if I can back check on a couple of things. When you refer to the April full year guidance, I think the output was plus or minus $3.4 billion-ish for the year. Is that still the zone that we're talking about as you reiterate it this quarter with a different mix?\nJohn Woods: Well, I mean, I think the -- what we're reiterating is that PPNR implied by that guide. And so yeah, I mean, I think -- and you see -- and we talked about the puts and takes on that, doing -- seeing NII coming in a little better and with some offsets and fees and expenses well controlled and well-disciplined on that and credit looking very positive and better than we expected as well.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Second question, can you give us, John, ISBC is in the full quarter? Any update on the magnitude and expected timing and run rating of the original $130 million of cost saves you expected?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'd say the best way to think about that is by the end of the year, you'll see a run rate of about 70% of that $130 million and then the full amount of the $130 million coming in next year.\nKen Usdin: Okay. So, would you know what quarter do you expect that to be kind of fully captured?\nJohn Woods: Well, next year -- we haven't talked to it. I mean, the big driver of it is getting the closedown in the first quarter. So, it will -- substantially all of that will be done by mid-year and there'll be some trickling in benefits in the second half, but most of that will be getting there by the middle part of 2023.\nKen Usdin: Got it. And last quick one. There was an increase in short-term borrowed funds in FHLBs and I'm just wondering you had the ones that were at ISBC and you had previously talked about getting rid of those through merger accounting. So, I'm just wondering, did that chunk that came over from ISBC get taken out, or is this -- are we now seeing the adds and are there extra adds on top of it? Kind of if you could just talk through those two buckets, the short-term borrowed funds and the FHLBs relative to what might have come from ISBC or what's just new adds because of your funding mix? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes. We had a carryover of about $5 billion from ISBC. And then the rest of the balance sheet flows on our end in terms of loan growth and securities growth drove the rest of the changes in the quarter.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would say on that, that ultimately, some of that's timing, Ken, is that the FHLB borrowings from investors will roll off, and we have cash coming in from some of the portfolios that we placed for sale. So, we would expect this is kind of a high watermark on the FHLB, all things equal and that we would bring that down by year-end.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you. A couple of questions. You mentioned regarding the PPNR guide well-controlled expenses. Your expenses this quarter, range you gave for last quarter, including HSBC-ISBC. When you mentioned well controlled expenses for full year 2022, can you give a little more color on what -- a little higher than where you were previously expecting? Lower? Unchanged? Any color on that?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I think we're seeing some positive benefits coming out of expenses. And so when we say well-controlled, I think we have some optimism that, that's going to be no greater than and possibly a little less than we expected.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Even though second quarter was at the high end, are you seeing some other additional costs?\nBruce Van Saun: That's true. If we said up 1% to 2%, given higher revenue-based compensation expense was the guide and they came in up 1%. So, I'm not sure where that's at the high end of the range.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Because I'm just looking at reported Bruce, and I see you were at 16% to 18%, it came in at 18% on reported.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I mean you have to look at underlying because that's really the integration costs that ticked that up. So, if you look at our underlying, we actually thought we did a really good job to keep them virtually flat. And then we would expect that strong performance to continue into Q3. And we called out, I think, maybe 4% for the whole year. It's roughly where we are, so.\nJohn Woods : And just on the integration cost, in fact, we did see more integration costs this quarter, but that's not signaling higher integration costs. It's just the opposite. We're pulling some into this quarter. We're expecting integration costs overall to be lower than we announced at\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nBruce Van Saun : That was just a pull forward the back in Q2.\nVivek Juneja : Okay. That's helpful. That's a completely different question. Early delinquencies, can you give us the numbers by loan category for second quarter 2022, meaning 30 to 89-day delinquencies?\nBrendan Coughlin : Overall, in the consumer side, delinquencies have been flat to even some signals of being very modestly down. Actually, we're seeing in no portfolio that we're looking at, do we see any signs of reinflation both at the 30-day level all the way through 90 days. So with a 120-day cycle to get to a net charge-off, it would take a whole heck of a lot of what you would need to believe to see net charge-offs in the consumer segment go up materially between now and the end of the year. Obviously, the place we're watching on the net charge-off line is things like used car values and recoveries on the resi portfolio, but those have been very stable and very high and very positive. We don't expect that to move very much either. So just the message overall in the consumer segment side is everything remains in great shape and without really any signs of a tick up, and the fundamentals remain strong too. Consumers still have 25%, 30% more in liquidity and deposits than pre-COVID and customer pay rates on credit cards pay in full, still are in the low 40 percentile. That was in the low 30s before COVID. So to believe that you'd start to see delinquency ticking up, you'd first probably see deposits start to burn down and you start to see customers relevering. We're not seeing that. Now we're a little bit unique from some peers in that our customer base skews much more mass affluent and affluent. But even when the same segment\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nBruce Van Saun : Credit score was super prime and high prime.\nBrendan Coughlin : We're super prime lender, where you see some market commentary on early signs of credit. It tends to be in the subprime space, and we don't have any of those businesses, but we don't see any signs of credit stress in any portfolio really across any of the segments that we're in.\nVivek Juneja : Okay. And not even in the other retail partnerships you've put on the point of sale, are you seeing any stretching by consumers there in terms of levering up more?\nBrendan Coughlin : No, I would direct you to a month or two ago, John and I went to the Morgan Stanley conference, and we shared some credit stress portfolio-by-portfolio. The Citizens Pay portfolio is performing exceptionally well and is, in fact, multiples below our prime credit card portfolio. And so not only is it super prime, but it's performing four, five, six times better than even a credit card portfolio. So we feel very good about that\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nBruce Van Saun : And that's because we draw a tight credit box in terms of what we are willing to take on the\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nBrendan Coughlin : Exactly. And where you start to -- we've been very ambitious on our desire to grow that business. But we've been disciplined on credit, and we're not going to -- we're not going to be undisciplined on credit in that business to drive growth. And so where we've been slower to see growth manifest in Citizens Pay, it's because we're not willing to jeopardize our credit discipline, and I don't see equally any signs of stress whatsoever on the Citizens Pay portfolio remains in great shape.\nVivek Juneja : Great. Thank you.\nBrendan Coughlin : Sure. Okay.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\nBruce Van Saun : All right. Well, thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate everyone's interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing slides four and five. We reported underlying net income of $595 million and EPS of $1.14. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.5%. Net interest income was up 31% linked quarter driven by a 29-basis point improvement in margin and strong loan growth, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Period-end loans were up 19% linked quarter. Excluding loans added by the HSBC and ISCC transactions, loan growth was a strong 4% led by commercial growth of 6%. Average loans are up 19% linked quarter, excluding the acquisitions, average loans were up 3% with 5% growth in commercial. Underlying fees were up 5% linked quarter or 2% excluding HSBC and ISBC acquisition impacts, reflecting the diversity and resiliency of our fee businesses. Our client hedging business had another exceptional quarter, and we delivered record results in Wealth and Card. Mortgage fees were up slightly and capital market fees were down a bit, given continued market volatility. We remain disciplined on expenses which were up 1% linked quarter, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions.  Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 11.7% linked quarter and that was 6.3%, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions. Our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 58%. We recorded an underlying provision for credit losses, excluding ISBC of $71 million, which reflects continued strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios.  The underlying credit provision for the quarter excludes $145 million for the double count of CECL provision expense tied to the ISBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.37% down from 1.43% at the end of the first quarter. Our tangible book value per share was down 6% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI.  We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.6%, and we have increased our common dividend by 8% to $0.42 a share. On Slide 5, we have provided the HSBC and ISBC contributions to our second quarter results as well as the notable items for the quarter. Also, Slide 21 in the appendix provides a summary of the purchase accounting impacts associated with the ISBC transaction. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for our second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 31%, given higher net interest margin and 17% growth in interest-earning assets, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions. The net interest margin is 3.04%, up 29 basis points, which as you can see on the NIM walk in the bottom left-hand side of the slide shows the benefit of higher rates with a 24 basis point increase related to asset yields reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and improved securities reinvestment rates. There is an 11 basis point benefit from the HSBC and ISBC transactions, largely given the repositioning of the ISBC securities portfolio and the benefit of adding their loans. With rising rates, funding costs reduced the margin 8 basis points, reflecting well-controlled deposit costs. Earning asset yields are up 38 basis points linked quarter, strongly outpacing our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are up only 8 basis points. Moving to Slide 7. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes and the current market expectation for the Fed funds rate to end the year in the 350 to 375 basis points range, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII in the first half of this year, and those benefits will continue to accumulate in the second half of 2022 and compound into 2023. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the top left side of this page, we've provided an estimate of our NII sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the June 24 forward curve. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at about 2.5% at the end of the second quarter. This is down from 7% for the first quarter, reflecting the incorporation of ISBC's NII base and liability-sensitive profile as well as hedging actions taken to stabilize the margin and protect against downside interest rate risks. Our improved NII outlook as well as changes in the balance sheet also contributed to the reduction in asset sensitivity. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $10 million to $15 million a quarter with that balance between the long and short parts of the curve. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity profile, deposit costs as low as they have ever been, and our overall funding profile greatly improved, including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. So far this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 150 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, we are quite pleased with how our deposit franchise is performing with a cumulative beta of about 6%. On a sequential basis for the second quarter, our beta was 11%. This puts us on track for a 35% cumulative beta through the end of this rate cycle if the forward curve plays out as expected. Moving on to Slide 8. We posted solid results, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee businesses. Capital Markets delivered solid results despite continued market volatility impacting the bond and equity markets. We saw M&A advisory and equity underwriting fees picking up a bit, but these were more than offset by modestly lower loan syndication revenue. We continue to see good strength in our pipelines and capital markets fees could rebound nicely in the second half of the year if markets settle down, and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. We once again delivered a record performance in our client hedging business, up $9 million linked quarter, driven primarily by FX as we help clients manage their currency exposures as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. Our interest rate and commodities businesses also performed very well, but were down modestly from record levels in the first quarter. Mortgage fees were up modestly linked quarter given improved servicing income as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Production fees remained under pressure given lower industry origination volumes with rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition continues to pressure margins. However, there are clear signs that the industry is beginning to reduce capacity, which should benefit margins as we head into the second half of the year. We delivered record wealth fees, up 8% linked quarter as rising market interest rates supported customer flows into annuity products. Card fees were also a record given seasonally higher transaction volumes. On slide nine, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter, excluding HSBC and ISBC. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress, on track to deliver $100 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Period end loans on slide 10 were up 19% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the ISBC transaction, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. Excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions, loan growth was 4% with strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 6%, led by C&I as we emphasize strong relationships to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Retail loans were up 1% as we continue to be more selective in consumer lending. Average loans were up 19% linked quarter or 3% excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions with 5% growth in commercial led by C&I and 1% growth in retail. In commercial, we continue to see strength in corporate banking originations across every region. Line utilization continued to rebound with an increase of about 300 basis points to 39% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking with the largest quarterly increase in utilization we have seen since early in the pandemic. Our clients are continuing to use their lines to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and some are also looking to pro rata bank financing as an alternative to the volatile bond markets. Comparing with the ISBC acquisition, we identified certain non-strategic loan portfolio totaling $2.1 billion, which we are in the process of being marketed for sale. These loans were classified as held for sale at quarter end. This will free up capital and enable our relationship bankers to focus on more desirable commercial relationship business in New York Metro. On slide 11, our period-end deposits were up 13% linked quarter as we added $19.8 billion of deposits from the ISBC transaction. Excluding ISBC and HSBC, period-end deposits were up slightly, while average deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonal runoff on a decline in commercial surge deposits. Moving on to slide 12. We saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were at 13 basis points, down six basis points linked quarter. Non-performing loans fell six basis points to 54 basis points of total loans linked quarter, driven by improvements in C&I, residential real estate, and home equity. Other credit metrics continued to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans as a percentage of the commercial portfolio are stable after incorporating ISBC, but down on a standalone basis. On Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see excellent credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. We added to the reserve this quarter to take into account strong commercial loan growth as well as the addition of ISBC. While we aren't seeing any signs of early stress in the portfolio at this point, our allowance takes into account the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic outlook, given the Fed's rate actions to combat inflation. Our overall coverage ratio was 1.37%, which is a modest decline from the first quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our retail portfolio and the addition of the ISBC's CRE portfolio, which includes a sizable multi-family component with lower reserve requirements than our legacy portfolios. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. To put our current coverage ratio in context, we estimate our pro forma coverage ratio would be slightly lower than the 1.37% level today if we applied our current portfolio mix, incorporating ISBC to our day one CECL approach. Importantly, our coverage of non-accrual loans strengthened 256%, up from 238% in the first quarter. We feel good about the improvements to the loan portfolio we've made over the past few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. Moving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.6%. Following the release of the Fed's DFAST stress results last month, our Board increased our common share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. And today, we announced an 8% increase in our common dividend to $0.42 a share. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit. On Slide 15, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of ISBC at the beginning of April, and we are very focused on a successful integration. I am proud of the work our teams have done related to the acquisition. We onboarded more than 1,600 new colleagues through our HR systems on day one, and in the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. We have a number of conversions planned over the remainder of the year, and we are on track to finish in the first quarter of 2023. We have included a high-level integration time line in the appendix on Slide 22. Importantly, we are on target to achieve $130 million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023, of which approximately 70% will be achieved by year-end 2022. The total represents about 30% of ISBC's 2021 expense base. Also, ISBC integration costs to be incurred through 2023 are now expected to come in below the estimated level of deal that you announced. We recently released our fifth annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights our progress on ESG initiatives. The report highlights a number of significant milestones related to our sustainability efforts, including our progress towards targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We also announced that we've joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, which will accelerate our efforts to measure and disclose finance emissions. Later this year, we'll release our first TCFD climate report, which will describe our climate strategy in more detail. The report also describes our commitment to the communities we serve, and there are a few recent examples here on the slide with some of the community partnerships we are engaged with in Boston and most recently in Chinatown and Queens, New York.  On the consumer side, we are excited about continuing our expansion in Florida with the opening of our latest Wealth Center in Naples. We recently released a mobile app version of Citizens Access, which we think will be very popular with our customers. And we are very proud that our Citizens Pay point-of-sale offering was awarded Best Innovation by the Banking Tech Awards. Lastly, our relentless focus on customer service, driving results as our ATM channel moved up eight places in the J.D. Power rankings.  On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner. The diversification in our business model is delivering results with record revenue in our client FX hedging business. We also closed the DH Capital acquisition this quarter, strengthening our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, software and next-generation IT services and communications sectors.  On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. Mobile active users are up over 20% year-over-year. Digital deposits and Zelle transactions are up over 30%, and we are seeing great success with the customer uptake of automated client service through virtual chat sessions. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction.  Moving to Slide 16. I'll walk through the outlook for the third quarter. Since we closed ISBC at the beginning of the second quarter, our third quarter outlook includes all our recent acquisitions. We expect NII to be up 5.5% to 7%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. We are very focused on optimizing capital deployment.  In consumer, we will reduce originations in mortgage, auto and education refi, while seeking to grow in home equity, in school education and Citizens Pay and Card. In commercial, we expect to see further increases in-line utilization, but we'll be mindful of balancing growth and returns given current macro uncertainty. These are expected to be broadly stable though upside exists, if capital markets stabilize.  Noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately 1%. We expect to continue strong sequential positive operating leverage in the third quarter and ROTCE above our medium target range of 14% to 16%. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land around the midpoint of our operating range at 9.75%. And our tax rate should come in a bit lower at approximately 22%.  With respect to full year results, we expect PPNR to be in-line with our April guidance. From a revenue standpoint, we are seeing higher NII given net interest margin, reaching approximately 3.25% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher rates and loan growth within our 20% to 22% guidance range. This will be offset by lower key revenue largely in capital markets and mortgage. Expenses will be well controlled, which will result in full year operating leverage of at least 400 basis points and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio of sub-55%. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to come in lower than we guided in April, given continued favorable trends.  To sum up on Slide 17. This was a very solid quarter and we are optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We are off to a running start in New York with the close of our two acquisitions there, and we expect significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment and strong and commercial loan growth. The strength and diversity of our fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize given strong pipelines. We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities and building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Good morning. Yes, sure. I mean I think that's right. I mean I think our base scenario this quarter really relies predominantly on a mild recession, which would last into sort of into next year. So, I think we're covering that part of it. We even layered in certain aspects of the portfolio a more severe recession. That's also built into where we are. And to Bruce's point, the mix shift in our portfolio has been extremely positive over the last couple of years. So, when you fast forward from the first quarter of 2020, the beginning of 2020 to the -- here in the second quarter of 2022, our mix profile is just much better. And so you can almost think about the fact that we're sort of back to the beginning where we have some uncertainty and some negative scenarios priced in. And without a significant deterioration in the macro as Bruce indicated, we're lucky to be in this range as you get into the end of the year. Yes, I'll take that. I mean, I think the best way to describe that. I mean, we articulated that our cumulative beta 6% through the second quarter, better than we expected. So we're feeling good about where we're starting off this rate cycle. Our outlook indicates a deposit beta getting into the 25% to 30% range by the end of the year, which implies the sequential betas in the second half in quarters being around mid-30s. So that's how that math would play out. So that's how that trajectory would work. The drivers of that are predominantly on the commercial side of the business, but as expected, consumer and retail deposits are incredibly well performing and well behaved in terms of deposit betas, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. We have a little bit of room on the balance sheet for Citizens Access. And all of that has been incorporated into our outlook for the 25% to 30% by the end of the year and for the approximate 35% through the whole cycle. Deposit betas will continue to rise as you get into 2023, and that's the difference between the approximate 35 and the 25 to 30 that we're talking about. And they tend to continue to rise when the Fed stops, assuming that the Fed doesn't start easing immediately thereafter, right? So the last cycle, we had the Fed end of the cycle over the next quarter, we were easing. And so that sort of clipped off the lag effect that you would typically see in deposits. But if the Fed stops and stands at then you would see deposit costs continue to rise for another quarter or two after the last Fed hike. But I should hasten to add that that there's the loan beta side of this equation. And the loan beta side of it is loan betas basically are rising, and they will continue to rise into the Fed tightening cycle and even after the Fed stops and our, in particular, all the tailwind from some of the term fixed lending that often really gain steam when you get to the end of the Fed tightening cycle, that's really what continues to drive net interest margin rising which we would say, would continue to rise throughout '23 even as the Fed continues to rise, given the fact that loan betas would exceed deposit betas. Yes, I agree with that. And the a\u0302\u0080\u0093 I guess the point is that, without management actions as you think about how the balance sheet unfolds from here. A big decline in the quarter really was just pulling in ISBC, just the base NII alone, reduces your assets a\u0302\u0080\u0093 you just have a bigger base on that a\u0302\u0080\u0093 from that percentage to be calculated. But so that was the source of the decline primarily and our management's actions. So, if you don't -- if you take away management's actions looking forward, actually, our asset sensitivity would tend to begin to rise again.  As mentioned earlier, the rotation out of consumer lending into a lot of the consumer commercial lending. And even within consumer lending, the fact that HELOC is a big driver, which is a floating rate product. You really are reestablishing asset sensitivity as things a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as the balance sheet unfolds in the coming quarters, all of that is absent management's actions, right? And so, that's really going to tell the tale about where we land things.  If we get towards the end of the year, it -- and if rates are inflation still remains stubbornly high, that will tell us where we take the balance sheet under that scenario. If it feels like June was peak inflation, as you get to the end of the year, you would see us wanting to lock in a little bit more. So, we'll just see how it plays out. But naturally underpinning the balance sheet is some upward lift on asset sensitivity. Sure. Yes. I think the -- you've got a big driver being commercial, right? And there's two drivers there. One is, the fact that there was some surge in the commercial business that has been running off. And frankly, most of that's been run off by the end of June. It's down to a relatively smaller level now and that was a driver -- also a driver is the natural seasonality of our deposit flows, which tends to have 2Q as one of the lower points during the year.  So, when you think about through the rest of the year, they'll be the broad continuing to execute against all the investments we've made over multiple years in driving consumer deposits and also the natural uplift and frankly, driving commercial as well. But the natural uplift at the second half tends to deliver in the commercial side of the business from a seasonality standpoint and lower drag from surge runoff. So that's how we see the second half playing out. Yeah. Well, I mean I think the -- in the second quarter, just talking about the jump off here, maybe helpful because in the second quarter, we had -- on the commercial side of the house, we had 5% average growth. But on a spot basis, we had 6% growth. So you can see that what that implies is that you're likely to see commercial be a big driver in the second quarter. So you're -- you see. Yeah. I'm sorry, in the third quarter. Sorry, yeah, you see commercial being a big driver into the third quarter. I think you're going to see puts and takes in consumer where you see home equity and some of the other categories that we like to see drive things in card and a little bit of mortgage driving it maybe being offset by auto and student a little bit. So that's how I would articulate it. Utilization continues to increase, but it's been about 50-50 utilization and other commercial growth. And so I suspect that, that will be the color into 3Q as well, utilization driving about half of it and the other half coming from outside of utilization. But again, I'd say 3Q driven primarily by commercial loans, maybe a similar amount of the loan growth percentage that you saw in 2Q. Yes. And one other thing, maybe just to close out there a little bit is to broaden it out to the second half. I think we mentioned -- in fact, there's a lot of moving parts here. And so we tried to really make it clear that our April guide had a 20% to 22% range of loan growth associated with it for the year and where basically -- all of these moving parts are going to fall into that range of the 20% to 22% loan growth increase in 2022. And hopefully, that's helpful. And how it shakes out between 3Q and 4Q, there's a lot going on there, but we're expecting to deliver as we indicated we would in our last guide. Hey Gerard. Yes. The biggest driver of that book is an equipment finance book, which is about half of it. And there are some non-accruals that -- and non-pass assets that did go into that portfolio. But more importantly, we think our underlying fundamentals with respect to the criticized being stable was a very good outcome. There are -- you've got some criticized coming out of ISBC with not a lot of loss content, and that's just a mechanism of migrating from the state chartered approach to how you manage that kind of stuff to an OCC-managed approach. So that was the impact there, but lost content quite low. And on an ACL basis, pound per pound, the needs from an ACL perspective are actually lower in the ISBC side of things, given that profile that came over. So we're feeling pretty good about that. Sure. Yeah. You're getting the whole team here, Erika, but that's a good question, obviously. But just to your other point on investors, I'd say that given our history, I think we're particularly well placed to embark upon that migration of that deposit base as well. And we'll be getting that process. We closed this quarter, and we've already begun to run our playbook through this rising rate cycle where we're lagging rate on that platform, which otherwise might not have been lagged and et cetera, et cetera. And so we're making the investments necessary. So we're optimistic that we'll begin to see some benefits coming out of that, which was also part of your question. Well, I mean, I think the -- what we're reiterating is that PPNR implied by that guide. And so yeah, I mean, I think -- and you see -- and we talked about the puts and takes on that, doing -- seeing NII coming in a little better and with some offsets and fees and expenses well controlled and well-disciplined on that and credit looking very positive and better than we expected as well. Yes, I'd say the best way to think about that is by the end of the year, you'll see a run rate of about 70% of that $130 million and then the full amount of the $130 million coming in next year. Well, next year -- we haven't talked to it. I mean, the big driver of it is getting the closedown in the first quarter. So, it will -- substantially all of that will be done by mid-year and there'll be some trickling in benefits in the second half, but most of that will be getting there by the middle part of 2023. Yes. We had a carryover of about $5 billion from ISBC. And then the rest of the balance sheet flows on our end in terms of loan growth and securities growth drove the rest of the changes in the quarter. Yes. I think we're seeing some positive benefits coming out of expenses. And so when we say well-controlled, I think we have some optimism that, that's going to be no greater than and possibly a little less than we expected. And just on the integration cost, in fact, we did see more integration costs this quarter, but that's not signaling higher integration costs. It's just the opposite. We're pulling some into this quarter. We're expecting integration costs overall to be lower than we announced ata\u0302\u0080\u00a6"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yeah. I think that's right. And just to put a point on what John said, we've got utilization up by about another 200 basis points across the C&I books and the Global Markets books in the third quarter. So that gives us a couple of billion dollars in potential outstandings. To Bruce's point, we're really starting to see the acceleration of a trend of companies that might want to refinance in the bond market coming to the bank market instead because the access on bank balance sheets is so much more attractive. And we're also seeing some transitory financing for M&A transactions and for maybe some buyouts coming more onto the bank balance sheets as opposed to some of the non-bank lenders. So I don't know what the exact mix will be, but there's a lot of things that are beginning to materialize. And it's not going to all go up because of that. We're going to take some other portfolios down and slow down some other things, similar to what Brendan said, what we've been doing for two or three years now just to change the mix of what's on the books. So, get a little more selective in terms of both returns of the capital we're deploying, but also being very careful of credit risk and the like, just in case we go into a little bit deeper slide. So, we're just being protective of the risk front also. Yes, I'm not -- Gerard. I'm not too worried about the loan syndication piece. And again, volumes are much lower than they were, and I think they'll -- it will be where the action is, but the mega deals seem to be struggling a little bit. So if you think about the environment we're, the biggest challenge we have on transactional execution is larger transaction and then clearing through the marketplace. And so I think you'll see a little bit of a dearth there. That's not really the business we're in. So I don't think it will affect our business. And then the other thing is you think about what's the price action that goes on in the securities market as the Fed is a seller versus a buyer. And I think one of the things that I'm looking at is the maturity ladder for corporate bonds and particularly high-yield bonds is relatively light for the next couple of years because everybody took advantage of the low interest rate environment of a couple -- over the last couple of years in refinance and push those maturities out. So I think we have some time for the market to adjust in particularly the public market to adjust to QT trend that we're going to see. Yeah, I'd say similar to Brendan, I mean we basically did not have a liquidity and deposit group seven years ago when we started our journey here and our payments business was fundamentally subscale and subpar. So we're getting a good lift on the payment sales in the core operating business, as you said, Bruce, which is bringing some deposits with it. And our -- just our analytics and our capabilities, not to mention the product suite that we've begun to develop is just in a completely different place. So it's a much stronger relationship pull with the client base. As the client base grows, there's more opportunity to bring in deposits. So we feel very confident in terms of the deposit franchise at the moment."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. There was a lot going on in Q2 with a focus on closing the Investors acquisition and commencing our New York City Metro integration efforts. In addition, the Fed's move to rein in inflation through higher short rates and quantitative tightening put a spotlight on a joint management of our capital, liquidity and funding position as well as our interest rate management. The good news is that we made strong progress on all fronts while posting very good financial results. Our underlying EPS for the quarter was $1.14, that's up 7% from the first quarter and ROTCE was 15.5%. Positive sequential operating leverage was 11.7% on an underlying basis, and that's 6.3%, excluding the impact of acquisitions, our PPNR growth was 45%. Driving these strong results was a significant sequential jump in net interest income of 31%. That's 9% ex-acquisitions as spot loan growth reached 19%, which is 4% ex-acquisitions, and our net interest margin jumped 29 basis points. We are seeing a strong pickup in line utilization in commercial which has afforded us the opportunity to be more selective in lower returning consumer portfolios like mortgage and auto. Our deposit performance was good as period-end deposits, ex-acquisitions, were up 1%. Our fees were relatively resilient, up 2% ex-acquisitions, given the diversity of our fee revenue streams. Higher volatility kept capital markets in check though it benefited FX and derivative product revenue, which hit an all-time high. Wealth continued to grow nicely in the quarter, while mortgage revenue was up slightly. We did our usual fine job on expenses and credit performance continues to be excellent. We continue to see favorable trends in key credit metrics on both the commercial and consumer side. At this point, we feel the second half should hold up well with only gradual normalization in loss rates given the solid positioning of our customers today. We currently expect our solid momentum to continue into the second half of 2022. We will continue to benefit from rate rises. Our fees should remain resilient, and we will benefit on expenses from our acquisition synergies and the TOP 7 program. We project positive operating leverage in Q3 and Q4 with ROTCE moving beyond our 14% to 16% target range.  The market seems concerned about the rising possibility of a recession in 2023 and the potential for much higher credit costs. At this point, we see slower economic growth as the base assumption for 2023 and if there is a recession, we believe it should be shallow and short-lived. We are being highly selective on new loan originations, and we've moved several portfolios to held for sale, largely from investors to optimize our balance sheet position.  We continue to believe our credit performance will be good on a relative basis, should a downturn come. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We have many promising initiatives in flight that we are managing well. We are focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths and where we have a right to win. The current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver prudent, sustainable growth. We certainly feel up to the challenge.  With that, let me turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John? Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A. Hi, there. Yeah. Well, let me start, and then I'll go to Brendan and then John, I'm sure might want to chime in. But I think we have the potential to continue to grow in consumer maybe at a faster pace than would be ideal in the current environment. So we're seeing a lot of growth right now on the commercial side line utilization picking up. And I think in light of the environment that we're seeing out there and transitioning in the investors' balance sheet, just making sure we're focusing on allocation of capital to the highest and best uses and not putting a strain on deposit growth as we're going through this higher rate environment is the game plan at this point. So when we look into the consumer world, clearly, mortgages and auto are areas where we've seen a lot of growth over the past couple of years. We're going to basically put mortgage more on a stable path and start to reduce our originations in auto. Those are really return costs. It's a return on capital cost where we think we have opportunities to grow in areas that deliver better returns would be things like HELOC, like the in-school student and then also card and Citizens Pay. So I think overall, we'll still see some net modest growth, but we're going to take some pluses and some minuses here and really be focused on capital allocation. So with that, Brendan, do you want to add to that? I think we said a lot, John, anything to add Okay. I think we're good. I'll kick off and hand it quickly to John. But one of the things we pointed out was that we're about where the day one reserve would have been had we incorporated Investors into those numbers. So, this 1.37 ratio. It's down from 1.47. But if you look at the shift in some of the asset composition, we're about at day one. And we have incorporated a Moody's scenario that does have a GDP slowdown and higher recession risk into that scenario. So, I would say, absent a meaningful change in outlook that we could probably hang around this neighborhood for a while. So, anyway, that would be my top of the house view. But John, for more detail, please? And I think it makes sense. If you just step back and think about the consumers in really good shape, still has a lot of liquidity. Companies have refashioned their business models coming out of COVID. They're all in pretty good shape and contending with inflation and supply chain and trying to maintain their margins. So, historically, if you have a good jump-off point, you go through a shallow recession, bank charge-off rates don't go up all that much. So I think you'd have to see a meaningful change in outlook for us to come off that view. Yes. Let me jump in. It's Bruce, and I'll give it back to John. But I think what we've tried to do, Scott, is find that sweet spot where we still have asset sensitivity sufficient to participate, if the Fed has to keep going beyond what's expected. But also, we like this level of NIM and this level of NII. And so, if in fact, a recession is in the offing and then rates turned down, we've locked in a fair amount of that NII for a good period of time. So just trying to get that balance right where we take away the downside and allow ourselves to continue to participate in the upside is, where we try to land it over the quarter. John? Yeah, just to make that clear. So the net would be -- we'd be expecting to resume growth in the second half. And I think that would be led by commercial growth, but consumer also would expect to see some growth as well. In the third quarter. And one thing about commercial, and maybe I could ask Don to comment on this is that when you kind of look at how companies are able to access new financing, right now, the public markets are pretty still in the water. So you've seen kind of more opportunities for the institutional market as well. So the bank syndicated lending market has seen an uptick, which I think is likely to continue as we look out into the second half. So Don, maybe you want to give some color on that. Good morning. Well, we're a bit in uncharted waters because we haven't seen quantitative easing to the extent we have and now the amount of tightening that the planning is going to be interesting to watch. I mean if I step back and think about where did a lot of that additional liquidity end up, I think the biggest banks took on a lot of it, the custody banks took on a lot of it. And I think when we view our space, the super-regional space, maybe we had some benefit from it, but a lot of it was just working on our playbook to deliver better for customers and establish whole relationships where we can capture the deposit opportunities that we were probably sub-optimized on both on the consumer side and the commercial side. So, I think the tightening process, you probably see it most impact the folks where the liquidity ended up, which would, in my view, be the bigger banks and the custody banks. In a bank like us, we still have a number of initiatives where I think we're not fully optimized in terms of the deposits per our relationship base, and we're going to continue to go try to gain market share and grab that. Yes. I guess I'm not -- I don't necessarily think that will be a huge driver in the loan volumes. I think the level of GDP growth and that spurs activity in the animal spirits and people wanting to put money to work. I think that's a bigger driver. But maybe on that, I'll defer over to Don. If, Don, you have any thoughts? Yes. Let me start, and then I'll pass the baton here to maybe Brendan and John. But I'd say, we feel really good about the progress we've made in just reformulating the deposit base, both in consumer and in commercial. So, in consumer taking a much more relationship orientation and not having that kind of thrift like lead with rate orientation that we kind of inherited when we got here.  And so, you can just see the results of that in terms of the noninterest-bearing growth, the affluent household growth, the stickiness of the deposits and the size per household going up. So, all those trends are terrific and I think they continue. So that's a cornerstone of the deposit strategy going forward.  I think we have been pretty astute in setting up Citizens Access and giving ourselves a kind of narrow swim lane to go after interest-sensitive deposits and compete for those. I don't think that, that's ever going to really become outsized relative to the overall mix. I think it's good to have and it's -- when we need incremental deposits, we can play with the rate, we can bring them in, but it serves its purpose.  Ultimately, if we get the national bank to where we want to get it, maybe some of those deposits will be a little rate sensitive as we try to get full wallet relationships with some of the national customer base. And then on commercial, again, I think we weren't as aggressive in seeking the operating accounts as we've been over the last few years and certainly seen a lot of growth there.  And then we didn't have the full range of capabilities things like escrow services and other services that different segments of the customer base need, we weren't competitive. They weren't built out and so, we've now built those out. And so, I think our whole speed and deposit growth going forward can continue to be reasonably strong. And hopefully, we'd like to get it growing faster than kind of the peers, which would give us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of loan growth that we can find while maintaining an LDR in kind of the mid to upper 80s. So that's a little bit top of the house thought process around that. But Brendan, maybe you could add something on the consumer side. Great answer, Brendan. Don, do you want to add anything? Yes. And I would say on that, that ultimately, some of that's timing, Ken, is that the FHLB borrowings from investors will roll off, and we have cash coming in from some of the portfolios that we placed for sale. So, we would expect this is kind of a high watermark on the FHLB, all things equal and that we would bring that down by year-end. That's true. If we said up 1% to 2%, given higher revenue-based compensation expense was the guide and they came in up 1%. So, I'm not sure where that's at the high end of the range. Yes. I mean you have to look at underlying because that's really the integration costs that ticked that up. So, if you look at our underlying, we actually thought we did a really good job to keep them virtually flat. And then we would expect that strong performance to continue into Q3. And we called out, I think, maybe 4% for the whole year. It's roughly where we are, so. That was just a pull forward the back in Q2. Credit score was super prime and high prime. And that's because we draw a tight credit box in terms of what we are willing to take on thea\u0302\u0080\u00a6 All right. Well, thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate everyone's interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yeah. I guess just strategically, what I'd add is I think this is a natural pivot point for the journey of our strategy. We're at the early stages of our IPO, everything was accretive for the most part. And so we've really scaled up our business. And I believe we have one of the most well run and diversified consumer lending franchises amongst our peer set for sure. And if we enter this next phase of our journey, capital allocation is king, and we're making some strategic pivots. I'd also say, this is not necessarily brand-new news. If you recall, prior to COVID, we had already started signaling we were going to start to put auto, as an example, on a path to reduce and get back into tier levels for concentration. And through COVID, we found some great vintages of returns and market disruption. So, the benefit of the diversity of our business model allowed us to flex up through COVID and now we're sort of returning to our original glide path down of auto, given that -- the auto business is naturally in sort of steady state, a lower return and less relationship focused. And then to Bruce's point on mortgage, we've been outgrowing the Citizens balance sheet on mortgage growth for quite some time. And so we would like for that to grow no faster than the rate of the bank, just given where we're at right now on interest rates and a long duration nature of that business. And so really making sure we're protecting our balance sheet for long duration for real relationship focused lending and customers is key. The other place we're curtailing a bit is some fintech partnerships that we've had over the years that served us well and added operating leverage allowed us to invest back in the bank, but being much more relationship focused and our capital allocation is king. But we're very excited, as Bruce pointed, about a couple our places of our franchise. HELOC being one, where we believe we're the number one originator in the US for HELOC origination. Credit quality is extremely good as super prime as it gets, 780 FICO, six year LTVs and we're poised to capitalize on that. And the in-school student product, as Bruce pointed out, is coming back strong as the effects of COVID wear off a little bit on student enrollment and then Citizens Pay, we do have aspirations for medium-term growth in that product. So, I think we're well-positioned. We can flex up. We're not taking down muscle mass, just making some capital allocation decisions as we optimize the balance sheet. Yes. I mean, on the consumer side, I'd say the last up cycle for rates was a bit of perfect storm for us for higher betas. We had a business model, as Bruce pointed out, it was more thrift-oriented, had higher promotional balances. We're growing loans materially faster than peers. So, we had to fund up the loan growth with a\u0302\u0080\u0093 on a base that was a little bit less healthy than peers.  And then we did a\u0302\u0080\u0093 we hadn't fully built out all of our capabilities in the bank. So, as I stare at consumer right now, I look at all of those dynamics, the underpinning health of the portfolio has remixed materially to low-cost deposits and that's based on just increased primacy and engagement with customers thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s long-term value creation, and that continues to improve quarter-over-quarter, quarter-over-quarter. That's allowed us to bring our elastic deposits down.  So last up cycle, we had something like $17 billion to $18 billion in promotionally priced elastic deposits, that's now in the mid-single digits in the core bank, putting aside Citizens Access. So the portfolio is mixed from the mid-40s percentages on low cost to -- into the 60s. That's a big buffer for better beta performance. We still believe the consumer segment will have a 25% to 30% net improvement rate cycle of rate cycle in betas. The other things we've done is we've built a lot of tools and capabilities. So Citizens Access is now something we're very good at. But that's not it. We've built a dramatically different product composition in the core bank. We've built highly sophisticated analytic capabilities with better targeting. So we do think we can go and very targeted raise deposits in the core bank, but with a much more precision than we did in the past, which will really mute the beta impact in consumer and allow us where we need to get deposit growth. We can contain it in Citizens Access. Last point I would make is inside the Citizens Access, we are starting to see some green shoots of deeper relationships beginning to form. So it's not just this contained deposit raising mechanism on the side. And that's going to benefit both betas but also cost. And so we're doing some tests to drive Citizens Access deposit raising across our national mortgage customers and our national student loan customers. Early results have been quite positive as we started to raise rates, and that's going to make it much more affordable for us to drive those deposits on the expense side, not just the beta side. So a lot of improvements in the health of the franchise. I would suggest the consumer bank is in a dramatically different position right now than we were five, seven years ago. Overall, in the consumer side, delinquencies have been flat to even some signals of being very modestly down. Actually, we're seeing in no portfolio that we're looking at, do we see any signs of reinflation both at the 30-day level all the way through 90 days. So with a 120-day cycle to get to a net charge-off, it would take a whole heck of a lot of what you would need to believe to see net charge-offs in the consumer segment go up materially between now and the end of the year. Obviously, the place we're watching on the net charge-off line is things like used car values and recoveries on the resi portfolio, but those have been very stable and very high and very positive. We don't expect that to move very much either. So just the message overall in the consumer segment side is everything remains in great shape and without really any signs of a tick up, and the fundamentals remain strong too. Consumers still have 25%, 30% more in liquidity and deposits than pre-COVID and customer pay rates on credit cards pay in full, still are in the low 40 percentile. That was in the low 30s before COVID. So to believe that you'd start to see delinquency ticking up, you'd first probably see deposits start to burn down and you start to see customers relevering. We're not seeing that. Now we're a little bit unique from some peers in that our customer base skews much more mass affluent and affluent. But even when the same segmenta\u0302\u0080\u00a6 We're super prime lender, where you see some market commentary on early signs of credit. It tends to be in the subprime space, and we don't have any of those businesses, but we don't see any signs of credit stress in any portfolio really across any of the segments that we're in. No, I would direct you to a month or two ago, John and I went to the Morgan Stanley conference, and we shared some credit stress portfolio-by-portfolio. The Citizens Pay portfolio is performing exceptionally well and is, in fact, multiples below our prime credit card portfolio. And so not only is it super prime, but it's performing four, five, six times better than even a credit card portfolio. So we feel very good about thata\u0302\u0080\u00a6 Exactly. And where you start to -- we've been very ambitious on our desire to grow that business. But we've been disciplined on credit, and we're not going to -- we're not going to be undisciplined on credit in that business to drive growth. And so where we've been slower to see growth manifest in Citizens Pay, it's because we're not willing to jeopardize our credit discipline, and I don't see equally any signs of stress whatsoever on the Citizens Pay portfolio remains in great shape. Sure. Okay."

As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also referenced non-GAAP financial measures, so it\u2019s important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. There clearly have been changes in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year, along with significant volatility. We feel we have executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of 2022. Among the highlights of the quarter, we had a successful conversion of the HSBC branch and online customers, which was then followed by closing the Investors acquisition on April 6. We continue to take actions to position our balance sheet well for rising rates and we have made further progress on our strategic initiatives, including our digital agenda and TOP 7 program. With respect to our financial results, we are off to a good start with underlying EPS of $1.07 and ROTCE of 13%. This is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of payroll taxes on expenses. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, given 3% average loan growth and higher NIM, which more than offset a sizable drag from lower PPP loan forgiveness revenue and day count. We saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgage given the environment, though high volatility benefited our Global Markets hedging business. We maintained strong deal pipelines in capital markets and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pickup if markets stabilize. We managed expenses well in the quarter and turnover has normalized somewhat. Credit metrics are all excellent and so far both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the current challenges. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with a CET1 ratio of 9.7%. We have the capacity to grow loans, pursue fee-based bolt-on acquisitions, raise our dividend in the second half of the year and buyback some stock. Our loan growth has picked up on the commercial side and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto a little, which will maintain an attractive LDR. I\u2019d like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for investors at the moment. First, and to be clear, we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates. Our funding base is vastly improved from where it was entering the last rate up-cycle. We have a 7% benefit from a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates, a 10 basis point cost of interest-bearing deposits and an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio. We project roughly $300 million in higher NII given the current curve, which annualizes to much more in 2023. This will more than offset roughly $100 million in lower fee income from the environment. John will take you through this in detail in his remarks. Second, while inflation pressures are real and the possibility of recession in 2023 has increased, we feel our credit risk position is in very good shape. We have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in consumer and over time we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have better credit profiles. As a result, our overall credit profile has improved over time. Our real-life and CCAR stress test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle of the super regional pack and we have carefully assessed investors\u2019 credit book and loss history and remain confident in their positioning, which we will further harmonize over time. Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, I would like to highlight that our focus in \u201822 is on integrating the acquisitions that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start, particularly our New York City Metro area initiative. We will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space, but we are highly disciplined acquirer and have not been able to get much done as a result. With respect to Florida, we now have 8 branches in the state and job one is bringing them to network performance levels. There does not appear to be much to do that\u2019s attractive inorganically and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the road. In short, you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline we have exhibited since the IPO. All-in-all, we feel very good about how we have started the year and how we are positioned to navigate the challenging environment. Given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions, we have provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models. We continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders. And with that, I will turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Great. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I will start with our headlines for the quarter. We have reported underlying net income of $476 million and EPS of $1.07. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter, driven by strong loan growth and a 9 basis point improvement in margin. Period-end loan growth was up a solid 2% linked quarter. Our retail loans are up about 3%, while commercial loans are up 2% or 3% ex-PPP impacts. Average loans are up 3% linked quarter paced by commercial, up 3% or 4% ex-PPP and retail up 3%. Fees were down 16% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets fees off a record prior quarter given market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull-forward of transactions into the fourth quarter. On a positive note, we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we help clients manage through the volatile environment. We remain disciplined on expenses, which were up 3% sequentially, excluding acquisitions, reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts. Year-over-year expenses were up a modest 2% excluding acquisitions. We recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of $21 million, which reflects strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive though we are monitoring whether Fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy. The underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes $24 million for the double count of Day 1 CECL provision expense tied to the HSBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, down slightly from 1.51% at the end of 2021 and the 1.47% Day 1 CECL level. Our tangible book value per share was down 10.5% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates of securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.7% after a 20 basis point impact from the HSBC transaction. Next, I will provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2%, given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the approximately $41 million combined impact from lower day count and the reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness. The net interest margin was 2.75%, up 9 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front book yields rising, which more than offset reduced PPP benefit. Margin is also benefiting from lower cash balances as we continue to redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. Of note, PPP spot loans were down to roughly $400 million at quarter end and forgiveness benefit headwinds are substantially behind us. We made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are now 10 basis points, an all-time low, down 3 basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 7, given the Fed\u2019s recent rate hike and the expectation for Fed funds rate to end the year in the 225 to 250 basis points range, we thought it would be helpful to discuss why we are confident that we will realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. We entered this rate cycle with a much higher level of asset sensitivity at 10% before the first rate hike in March. This is already starting to benefit NII in the first quarter and is driving the significant improvement in our full year outlook and those benefits will continue to accumulate into 2023. Importantly, our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely transformed our funding base since the IPO. We are beginning the current up-cycle with a very strong liquidity profile. Our LDR is much lower. Our deposit costs are as low as they have ever been and our overall funding profile was greatly improved. Our period end demand deposits are now 32% of the book compared with 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And within our interest-bearing deposits, our consumer CDs are now less than 3% of total deposits compared with about 10% at the start of the last cycle. We are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding. This improved deposit profile reflects the significant improvements we have made to our deposit franchise since the IPO with improved and expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings. We have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract and retain more stable deposits. With a better starting position and the improvements in our deposit mix and capabilities, we expect our interest-bearing beta to be about 35% over this freight cycle, which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at 7% at the end of the first quarter. This is down modestly from 10% at the end of 4Q, with the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impact of our higher NII outlook given the benefits from the April 6 forward curve and the evolution in the balance sheet. Pro forma from the Investors acquisition, asset sensitivity is slightly over 6%. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the bottom left side of this page, we have given you an estimate of our sensitivity to further changes in rates either up or down from the forward curve. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $20 million to $25 million a quarter, with most of that coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve. This includes the pro forma impact of Investors. Moving on to Slide 8, we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses and we drove solid performance across other key categories. Capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull forward into the full fourth quarter of 2021. Given the strength of our pipelines, capital markets fees could rebound nicely as markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. Demonstrating the diversity of our business, we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets, a 46% linked quarter as we worked with clients to manage their foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity exposures. Mortgage fees were down 9% linked quarter against a backdrop of lower industry origination volumes, given rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition and excess industry capacity continue to pressure margins. Mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Card fees and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality. Debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels and wealth fees also remain strong. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 3% linked quarter and just 2% year-on-year, excluding acquisitions. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is well underway, targeting $100 million of pre-tax run-rate benefits by the end of the year. Period-end loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 2% or 3% ex-PPP. Average loans were up 3% linked quarter. Driving this was average commercial loan growth of 3% or 4% ex-PPP impacts, led by C&I with growth across almost every region, including our expansion markets. Average retail growth was also 3%. Line utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about 150 basis points to a little over 36% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking led by manufacturing and trade as companies look to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and facilitate some M&A activity. On Slide 11, our period end deposits were up 3% linked quarter as we added $6.3 billion of lower cost deposits with the HSBC transaction. Excluding HSBC, period end and average deposits were down slightly, given seasonal impacts as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels. Moving on to credit on Slide 12, we saw an excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were up slightly at 19 basis points for the first quarter, with good performance across the portfolio. Non-performing loans increased by $87 million linked quarter, primarily driven by residential real estate secured loans exiting forbearance. Other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans were lower. While we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession, we feel good about the improvements in the portfolio we have made over the last few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. In the appendix on Slide 21, you will see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved given changes through the pandemic, including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger mid-corporate credit portfolio, which is higher rated as well as reductions in stressed sectors such as retail malls, education and casual dining. On the retail side, we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segments. Our risk profile has improved given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix, including the runoff of our personal and secured product. Of note, the Investors portfolios have performed well in prior cycles and we feel good about them. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.7% at the end of the first quarter after closing the HSBC transaction, which had a 20 basis point impact. We also wanted to mention that we have widened our target CET1 operating range to 9.5% to 10% from 9.75% to 10%, reflective of the continued progress we have made in improving profitability, revenue diversity and overall risk management. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed as you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit, on Slide 14, you will see some examples of the progress we have made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of Investors at the beginning of April, further expanding the foothold we established in the New York City Metro area through the HSBC branch transaction and significantly advancing our growth plans. In the consumer business, we were excited to complete the upgrade of Citizens Access to a fully cloud-enabled core platform, which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our multiyear objective of convergence with our core banking platforms. We also recently announced Citizens ever value checking, a new overdraft free checking account designed to meet bank on national account standards and increased banking access for underserved communities. On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the TOP 10 as a middle-market and sponsor book runner. On the right side of the page, we have included some digital metrics. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions, we provided a comprehensive update to our 2022 guidance on Slide 15. The good news here is that our guide is up for our standalone business. Rates are helping NII more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees. So, PPNR is higher and there is no change in our positive view on credit and we remain confident in the outlook for the bank deals. I will focus my comments on the full year outlook, including both HSBC and investors, but we have also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance. We have also included a comparison to our original guide from January to help highlight what is driving the overall improvement in the full year outlook. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of April 6, which implies a Fed Fund\u2019s target of 225 to 250 basis points by the end of the year. On the long end, this rate curve implies the 10-year treasury to be about 270 basis points at the end of the year. It is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full year effect upside to NII in 2023. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 27% to 30% driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid average loan growth of 20% to 22%. On a standalone basis, NII is about $290 million to $330 million better than our prior guidance given the higher rates. Average interest-earning assets are expected to be up 14% to 16%. Fee income is expected to be up 3% to 7%. On a standalone basis, fee revenue will be about $100 million lower than the January guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue as well as capital markets somewhat. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 16% to 18% given the full year effect of HSBC and Investors as well as our commercial fee-based acquisitions. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly for the year and we expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of about 9.75%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. Our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items for the year, including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our TOP 7 costs. You can see those in the appendix on Slide 20. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, excluding the acquisitions. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be over 4% operating leverage. Including acquisitions, we expect operating leverage of over 4% and over 7%, excluding PPP. Overall, we expect our full year ROTCE to land solidly within our 14% to 16% medium-term target range. Moving to Slide 15, I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter. On a standalone basis, we expect NII to be up 6% to 8%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. With the bank acquisitions, we expect NII to be up 27% to 29%. On a standalone basis, average loans are expected to be up 1% to 2%, led by commercial, with interest-earning assets up slightly. Fees are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a standalone basis, reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits. Including the acquisitions, fees are expected to be up 7% to 9%. Non-interest expense on a standalone basis is expected to be up 1% to 2% given higher revenue-based compensation. Including the acquisitions, expenses are expected to be up 12% to 13%. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, and we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%. To sum up with Slide 17 and 18, we started \u201822 with a solid quarter. We have a winning strategy and are well positioned to succeed given the strength and diversity of our businesses. We are very optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and strong loan growth. Our capital markets business is well-positioned as markets stabilize and we are very excited about the opportunity to grow our business in the New York Metro region as we integrate and build on HSBC and Investors. We will continue to focus on execution and building a top performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I will hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let\u2019s open it up for some Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could spend just a moment discussing sort of the magnitude of recovery you are assuming in the capital markets environment in the forward guide. It looks like you assume some recovery in the second quarter, but of course, moderated the full year target a bit. Just curious for some thoughts or color on how you see things trajecting from here?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I will go ahead and start off on that. I mean I think you had number of impacts there that we are building into the guide. I\u2019d say that we mentioned our $100 million guide over guide, which is driven primarily by mortgage. But there is some capital markets implications there as well given the fact that 1Q, we had some pull forward into the fourth quarter. If you look back at the fourth quarter, we had a record quarter, but our pipelines look excellent. And so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year. But as markets stabilize, we really think that the momentum there is strong. And so maybe Don can cover.\nDon McCree: Yes, I think it\u2019s a tale of a couple of different cities. So, one thing we are seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan market, the syndicated loan market. So, while the bond market is particularly high yield and the equity markets have been pretty much close for the last few months, we are seeing some rotation into the syndicated loan markets as the liquidity there kind of rebuild and you have seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the last couple of days actually. And that\u2019s been quite supportive. So, I think the second quarter will be really a story about syndicated lending. And then if we get a reduction in volatility, we think we are going to begin to see the bond markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen. I will say what John said, which is our pitch activity, our pipelines and our mandates are extremely strong. And so, it\u2019s really a matter of waiting for the constructive in the markets to return and then we will begin to bring deals. And we saw three or four deals start to emerge last week, which we were on and we feel pretty good about, particularly in the back half of the year.\nBruce Van Saun: The other thing you didn\u2019t mention is the M&A pipeline, which I think still looks really, really good. And again there, if the market stabilized a little bit, I think we will start to pull those deals through and it\u2019s typically seasonal that the fourth quarter is huge, which it was for us in 2021. And then the first quarter is usually softer seasonally, pipelines look good. And I think as the year goes, we should see a nice build in M&A revenue.\nDon McCree: Yes. I will also just amplify that, Bruce, to say a lot of our capital markets and M&A activity surrounds private equity. So, private equity is still flushed with cash and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the market right now. So, it\u2019s a matter of matching sellers kind of desires and buyers desires and that will just take a little time to kind of work through the system.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, good.\nScott Siefers: Wonderful. That\u2019s good color. Thank you. And then, John, was something you could talk just a bit about how your rate sensitivity changes as the cycle progresses meaning effectively, how do the first few rate hikes look in your mind versus the next several?\nJohn Woods: So did you say asset sensitivity or was it just \u2013 I missed the...\nScott Siefers: In other words, how much more powerful are the first few rate hikes than the next two?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, I\u2019d say that the \u2013 we mentioned our $20 million to $25 million per instantaneous 25 rate hike, and that\u2019s really an average. So you get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end of it. And that\u2019s really driven by deposit betas, which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first 100. And then that starts to build into the second 100 and then beyond. So yes, I think you will see possibly a bit more on the front end. When we\u2019re seeing those lag effect in deposit betas contribute a touch more and then it will be a little lower on the back end. I will mention is the other point that 20% to 25% is an average, but it\u2019s also a first year average. And so there is actually more upside when you get into \u2013 even if it\u2019s instantaneous, you still get a lag effect benefit from the asset side as well as assets reprice. So you might see, for example, in year 2, even for an instantaneous 25 basis point change, you would see upside from there in the 15% to 20% range on top of that as you get into rolling year 2.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Alright, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Thank you so much for Slide 7. And I guess, John, maybe let me start my line of questioning here. So your current asset sensitivity from here is pro forma for Investors. I wanted to understand the comment that was made earlier about acceleration, right? So on one hand, we do expect deposit betas to accelerate as we are deeper into the rate cycle. But on the other hand, you have some drops on your portfolio today. Can you talk a bit about the interplay of both? And how should we think of this asset sensitivity as we move forward in the rate cycle? And does the swap portfolio give you a different trajectory for enhanced sensitivity later?\nJohn Woods: Yes. Thanks, Erika. I think if you\u2019re on Page 7, I mean, I think that the drivers there are that we\u2019re entering this cycle were much better positioned than the last cycle. When you think about just the starting point with interest-bearing deposit costs being at 10 basis points, an all-time low for us, we started the last cycle at 34 basis points. And the balance sheet position, the mix on the deposit side is much better with 32% noninterest-bearing. So we feel \u2013 just we\u2019re much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around. We still benefited from rising rates last time around, by the way, but we\u2019re much better prepared to benefit from this side around \u2013 this time around on deposit betas, given all of the strength on the balance sheet. I\u2019d say when you ask about balance sheet, I mean, I think \u2013 and swaps, you really have to think about in the context of the entire balance sheet. So we do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out. That will decline over time as NII keeps rising, as I mentioned in my remarks, the denominator effect as we update and increase our NII, that alone reduces the percentage of further benefit that could occur for future rate hikes, just dollar for dollar, it\u2019s fine, but the percentages fall. But I do think that there is significant firepower left, both with respect to the balance sheet loan growth part of the story as well as much more hedging left to do before asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral. So that\u2019s how I would describe it. I mean in terms of deposit betas, again, 2022, you\u2019re going to see a lot of lag, a lot of lag in the first 100. It will start to catch up maybe in the second 100. And then if we really do get to 300 basis points in Fed funds, you\u2019ll see some of that catch up in 2023. And then I\u2019ll just close out with our conversation about NII being up $290 million to $330 million guide over guide is an important thing to focus on, and that\u2019s on a gradual rate rising scenario. It may be \u2013 it could be \u2013 it\u2019s much higher in a full year effect when you get to 2023 approaching maybe 2x that.\nBruce Van Saun: And I would just add, Erika, that we\u2019ve been I think, very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do significant additional swaps we\u2019ve done a bit. But anyway, we\u2019re still, I think, of the view that rates could go even higher here. So feel good about how we\u2019re positioned right now.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And the second question is for you, Bruce. The stock is having a good start to the day, but the valuation on tangible book value is underneath your ROTCE landing point for the year, either on a standalone or a pro forma basis. I guess what do you think in your estimation that the market doesn\u2019t understand about the improvement that the bank has made since the IPO? And wondering, I think part of that is the asset sensitivity and deposits. Wondering if you could answer that question as the way \u2013 however way you want to, but also could you give us a sense of how much checking accounts you have, for example, on the consumer side versus previous? And maybe remind us why you have to keep what seems like a 50 to 100 basis point higher capital level than a lot of your regional peers?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. There is a lot in that. I\u2019ll try to unpack that, Erika. But I think partly the \u2013 our objective here is to continue to perform well through cycles. And so we\u2019re a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team. And so I think when the market goes into a risk thought posture, some assumptions how are they going to do, we\u2019re not as \u2013 we don\u2019t have the historical track record of some of our peers, I think. I think we\u2019ve done a good job of dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic, and our credit performance was very good. I think there was some concern for law that we\u2019ve grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get releveraged after the IPO and was that going to end in tiers. And we\u2019ve said all along and we\u2019ve been very disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital, and I think that\u2019s borne fruit. I think now with an up cycle, at the beginning of the year when the environment looked like rates were going to go up gradually to use a Goldilocks example, that was the page was just right scenario. And so our stock performed quite well out of the chute. I think once it became clear that the Fed was behind the curve and was going to start to raise rates much more aggressively, I think then you kind of tipped into it, well, maybe the is too hot. And will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefit from higher rates. And I think, again, with all the work we\u2019ve done and analysis we\u2019ve provided, we\u2019re quite confident that the liability side of this bank is much, much better than it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019ve done a lot of hard work on that. And so we still think whether the path is fast or whether it\u2019s more gradual, we\u2019re going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates. I\u2019d say also on fees, there is probably a concern that we\u2019ve built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in capital markets and mortgage is kind of a big fee elements for us. Having said that, I think you\u2019ve seen that there is good diversity in our fees. And so in a pandemic period, when capital markets were a bit softer, mortgage revenues were really, really strong, given lower rates, and we see \u2013 we can see that flip around. But I think the fact that we\u2019ve assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and have targeted focus on private capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that really are the engine of the economy, technology, health care with our JMP acquisition, I think we\u2019re very confident that we can grow revenue sustainably in capital markets and they\u2019ll move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend line is upwards and to the right. And again, on the mortgage business, I think we\u2019ve built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across wholesale channels in our retail channel. I think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by building market share. So we plan to hire more this year. So I think all of these aspects are take time for the market to come around and fully appreciate, and we will just keep doing what we\u2019re doing and putting up good results and executing well. And then I think, ultimately, the stock will take care of itself. With respect to the non-interest-bearing liabilities, I mean, the DDAs as a percentage of the total deposit base is up to about 32%. I think when I walked in the door at the time of the IPO that was probably in the low 20s. So that\u2019s been a dramatic improvement, focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on the consumer side and then also on the commercial side actually just building out our capabilities and investing in our core platform and cash management offering. And so it\u2019s just been a gradual improvement over time as we enhanced our abilities and our targeting and we\u2019ve had nice growth as a result. So I think I\u2019ll stop there. Does anybody want to add to that, Brendan, do you want to talk about consumer deposits and Don on the commercial?\nBrendan Coughlin: I\u2019m happy to give \u2013 Erika, you had asked about sort of the counts of checking account customers. Just kind of a couple of quick points, when you look at total relationships in the consumer bank, when we went public, we had about 2.9 million to 3 million customers. We now have over 7 million customers in total. Now some of those are loan customers. So when you unpack that to core deposit customers, that number is sort of we went from 2.9 million to 3.5 million customers. So that\u2019s good growth, but that\u2019s really not where the action is in the story versus sort of heading down this path really under the covers on that growth, which we\u2019ve been in sort of top quartile growth of our peers has been a quality transformation. So there is been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank. And more than 100% of the growth in the household base has come from mass affluent and affluent customers. So when you combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships, that\u2019s what\u2019s driving a lot of the improvement in DDA and non-interest-bearing deposits, which is very sustainable. That\u2019s kind of ground game a lot of work over multiple quarters over a lot of years to get that to scale. And look, we still have some running room. I think there is still oxygen left in tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in catching up to peers, but we still have momentum. It does not seem to be slowing. I think you should expect more and more of that putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus deposits under the coverage, the quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale. The other point I\u2019d make mention obviously you think about betas for this up cycle last time because of the low DDA balances that we had in consumer, we had about $10 billion in CDs. Now we start that period with only $3 billion. And so \u2013 when we look a lot more like a bigger sized bank in terms of deposit composition than we do smaller-sized bank where we\u2019re not as rate sensitive in how we\u2019re driving deposits because of that quality transformation that you see in the customer base.\nDon McCree: Yes. And I\u2019ll just emphasize, Bruce, what you said in terms of \u2013 we\u2019ve gone through a complete reconstruction of our treasury service business. So it was frankly a basket case 6 years ago. And now I would put it up against any other company\u2019s treasury service business, and that\u2019s driving an above trend growth rate, 7% to 10% in terms of year-on-year growth and also driving a skew towards non-interest-bearing deposits. And we didn\u2019t even have a deposit team 6 years ago. And now we have a built-out team, which has got fantastic analytics and bringing new offerings like green deposits in the ESG agenda and also building a liquidity portal. So, it\u2019s a totally different place and we\u2019re seeing the results in terms of deposit levels, and we\u2019re seeing the skew towards non-interest-bearing also.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. So we\u2019re giving you a long-winded answer, Erika, but I wanted to just come back to the last thing you touched on which was ROTCE and also our capital targets. So I think we\u2019re pleased that we can say that we will be solidly in the range for our medium-term targets this year, the 14% to 16%. And you can see that where we were in the first quarter, that should ramp, and so we could be even stronger, I think, as we exit the year. So feel very good about that. We did move the targets from 9.75 to 10 to 9.5 to 10. So we moved them modestly. I\u2019m still a big believer in being somewhat conservative on the capital, particularly as, as I said, we\u2019re a relatively new company. And so I think all our stakeholders from maybe being slightly higher than our peers. But if you look at it over time, we\u2019ve been converging to peers. And honestly, when you look at the CCAR results and our risk profile, there is no reason that longer term we will need to have that premium.\nErika Najarian: Thank you for the complete answer.\nBruce Van Saun: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Your line is now open.\nBrian Foran: Hey, good morning. Maybe to follow-up on deposits, you have been very clear and convincing on the improvement in the book. So that\u2019s appreciated and great information. As you think also about the ability to grow deposits over the next 2 years, I wonder \u2013 and there is a lot of moving parts. There is no one answer. But if you could just give your thoughts on the ability to grow deposits overall and maybe I\u2019ll touch on consumer versus commercial and how that might behave as rates go up?\nJohn Woods: Yes. Great question, Brian. I appreciate it. I think that if you basically look at excellent opportunities for our deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved. And I think if you separate the expectation for \u2013 as rates rise, there is some impact on how those deposits play out. There is also the surge deposits that came in, in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought when they first showed up. I do think more broadly when you think about the macro, deposits have grown consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios even through quantitative tightening and the like, the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug along. So we\u2019re optimistic that the industry as a whole and we, in particular, given our significantly expanded product capabilities, we will be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both consumer and commercial side. So maybe I\u2019ll just turn it over to Brendan and then maybe Don.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated in a variety of cycles, the ability to deposits at scale. The question is always at what cost? And I think we\u2019re in a dramatically different position in up cycle than we were certainly in the last up cycle, we continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side, starting with just the breadth of the levers that we\u2019ve built, whether it\u2019s the Citizens Access platform nationally to raise deposits away from our core book the new markets that we\u2019re entering, where we\u2019ve got a solid and stable deposit base, but we think there is a lot of up running room. And in fact, we\u2019re starting to see signs already. We\u2019ve got $100 million in inflow of balanced sales already in the New York market from great execution and solid sales. So we\u2019re optimistic continuing to go forward, that can continue. And as we bring convert the customer base from investors closely they want into the platform, we think that same opportunity will exist in New Jersey. And then our analytics have improved materially over the last couple of years, which allows us to be even more targeted. And when you marry that with what I said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our customer base, the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market rates than needing to reach for promo rates. So I feel really good that we will be able to grow at the pace we need with a much more moderate cost.\nDon McCree: Yes. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I think I said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that business. But also remember, we\u2019re expanding aggressively in terms of our client base. So we\u2019re in expansion markets. We\u2019re adding a lot of clients and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs. So we feel pretty good about it. But I\u2019ll go back to what Brendan said also, it\u2019s really a matter of the day-to-day balancing of volume versus cost and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital. So it\u2019s something that we manage carefully, but I feel confident that we\u2019re going to continue to expand the deposit base.\nBrian Foran: I appreciate all that. I will say I\u2019m a Citizens Access customer. I am not loving the renewed beta assumptions you\u2019re making, but I guess I\u2019ll have to live with it.\nBrendan Coughlin: Well, you can count on us continuing to be disciplined yet competitive.\nBrian Foran: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBetsy Graseck: Hi, good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nBetsy Graseck: Two questions. One was just on the most recent conversation that we had on deposit growth. I was intrigued by that. Relative to Bruce, your comment about flowing resi and auto lending growth to, I don\u2019t know, if this is the right word, but keep the LDR, protect the LDR at around the 83% level. So I guess I just wanted to understand if that comment about LDR was more about the deposit growth rate that you were talking to just now? Or was that because of the just opportunities in resi and auto that you\u2019re not seeing as much as maybe you have had over the past few quarters?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s kind of a factor of a number of considerations. One is that we\u2019re already seeing very strong loan demand on the commercial side. We\u2019re seeing line utilization tick up. So there can be somewhat of a rotation over into more growth on commercial. Therefore, when we look at consumer and in the higher rate environment, some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage aren\u2019t what they used to be. And so we can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side. And we could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets, but we think we don\u2019t need to do that at this point. We\u2019ve got NIM going up. The rate hikes is providing a big lift. And if the marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isn\u2019t hitting our hurdles, and we have no problem backing off that. The net result of that is that, that benefits the LDR versus keeping the pedal to the floor. So we think that\u2019s a trade-off we\u2019re taking.\nBetsy Graseck: Okay. And then just your \u2013 I guess the underlying question is how high are you willing for LDR to go? And then I also had just a quick question just on yields in general. This past quarter, you had some nice uplift in resi and the securities book, other retail loans. And I\u2019m just wondering was that a function of swap activity that drove up those yields 2Q or was there \u2013 it didn\u2019t look like the balances would have driven that 2Q. So just wondering how the deals went there? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me start off and then maybe John and Brendan can add on the yield question. But we\u2019ve been \u2013 historically, since the IPO, we\u2019ve had a relatively higher LDR that we worked hard to bring down from the high 90s down into the mid-90s. And then with this big influx of liquidity into the market, we\u2019ve been able to bring the LDR back down to 80-ish and it\u2019s inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that we\u2019re experiencing. I think we should still be able to manage that in the \u201880s, and I can\u2019t really call exactly where that\u2019s likely to be partly depends on the amount of loan growth that we see. But I think just the way we, over time, brought it from high 90s down into mid-90s and I think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity. So that would be my answer there. John, maybe you want to pick up the yields?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I\u2019ll start off on securities and maybe Brendan can take mortgage. But I can tell you, overall, that it\u2019s not swap activity that\u2019s having an impact on either of those. And as it relates to securities, just to give you a sense, there is two dynamics going on there. One is the front book where current yields on the stuff coming into the portfolio are north of 3%. So we\u2019re in the 300 to 330 basis point range, that\u2019s a driver in 1Q. It wasn\u2019t at that level during 1Q, but it was well over 2%. It was probably 230 to 250 during the first quarter, and that was compared to maybe 175 in 4Q. So that\u2019s the dynamic you\u2019re seeing 1.75 in 4Q, 2.30-ish in 1Q and announced over 3%. So that will continue into the second quarter. The other dynamic is the back book premium amortization tends \u2013 declines when rates rise. So you\u2019re seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book. And so that\u2019s the driver there. And maybe Brendan can talk about mortgages.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. There is a handful of things on the consumer side. So on other retail, there is a good percentage of that book that\u2019s variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such. And you\u2019re going to see that kind of ramp up as the market changes. On the resi side, we\u2019re obviously a very big lender in HELOC, which is essentially all variable. And we\u2019ve had four sequential quarters in a row and net balance sheet growth and I believe we\u2019re the number one originator in all of the United States and HELOC. So really striking well the iron is hot and taking advantage of that business. So you\u2019re seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there as the rates kind of March north. On the mortgage side, there is a couple of things. One is front book pricing. We\u2019ve been disciplined on front book pricing to the point of being a lot on the market at times as the market lags capacity, but we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the market. The other just technical dynamic that you\u2019re seeing, if you\u2019re looking at linked quarter on mortgages in Q4, we did have a one-time reserve adjustment to the yields in Q4 that is non-recurring and didn\u2019t happen in Q1. So if you look back a couple of quarters, you\u2019ll see a little bit of noise on what you saw in Q4, but that\u2019s kind of gone. That\u2019s sort of washed out, so we should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that book that is in variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing.\nBetsy Graseck: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you guys could remind us with investors, is there any portion of the loan book or securities book that you\u2019re looking to kind of deemphasize or runoff?\nJohn Woods: I\u2019ll just start off there. I mean I think that the securities book and investors looks as a profile that we would migrate and frankly, have already been migrating to our profile, which is mostly clean duration plus mortgage-backed securities, agency-type paper. So we\u2019ve been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front. In general, we like the loan book that comes over from investors has performed well from a credit perspective. They have a nice core portfolio over there. Maybe Don can talk about anything else that might be migrated at the margin.\nDon McCree: Yes. There are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward, but it\u2019s not going to be quick and aggressive. We are going to do it \u2013 we are going to migrate it over time. But a lot of the business that they do is very diversifying for us. They are in different elements of the CRE business than we are. So, it looks quite different. And then a lot of the C&I business is smaller company business banking, and we are looking to grow that segment as we move forward. So, you will see some adjustment at the margin, but no aggressive asset sales, I think out blocks.\nJohn Woods: Other than \u2013 I will say, Matt, on my side, we are doing roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion of DSO adjustments on the Citizens side, and you will see us do some of that as we move around low-yielding assets that we might be acquiring, but we don\u2019t have full plans on that yet.\nDon McCree: Yes, balance sheet, optimization and\u2026\nMatt O\u2019Connor: And then I guess, obviously, there are some opportunities as well to essentially cross-sell. But as we think about layering in investors to the kind of medium-term, do you think it will have any net impact as we think about your loan growth, either a little bit less than standalone or a little bit more or roughly the same?\nJohn Woods: Well, I mean I would look at it as what Don and Brendan has been able to accomplish when we go into expansion markets, right, in particular, Don\u2019s business and commercial when we entered the Southeast is a good playbook for how we have been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over time. So, I think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and conversion, and we have been able to make our investments that we plan to make in New York Metro. I would suspect for a number of years, you could see the growth rates once that all settles out and baseline, you can see those growth rates actually being higher than Citizens standalone for a number of years until it balances out in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that metro.\nDon McCree: Yes. John, I will also add that they have a very limited product set on the C&I side. So, bringing in the variety of products that we can offer and capabilities that we can offer, we think there is an opportunity to go after larger companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. The same comments on the consumer side, our product set is significantly more diversified than both HSBC and investors, which is great. And we didn\u2019t build those revenue synergies into the deal model. So, we are seeing early signs of significant sales opportunity in New York. We are delivering on that. We are starting marketing middle of the year. We are going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for investors inside of 2022, and then the rest of the platform will convert in 2023. So, it will take some time, but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue growth over time.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Let me just chime in here as well, is that we think these deals are going to be a big success, and it\u2019s really not just the expense synergies, which we are going to go get. But if it\u2019s a big success, it means that we were successful in cross-selling more to the customers who haven\u2019t had the benefit of our broader products and services and then just gain market share. And I think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that, both on the commercial side and the consumer side. And really none of that is \u2013 has been put into our forward forecast at this point. So, goal would be like within 3 years to 5 years, if New York starts to take on a look and feel of what we built in Boston and what we built in Philadelphia, is going to be a home run for us.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about reserving and provisions. So, just looking back at where you are 130 \u2013 143 ACL is pre- ISPC and then just with all the CECL stuff going on, just wanted to kind of understand where do you think that the reserve lands vis-\u00e0-vis a blended day one? And what does that mean for further release or provision growth relative to your expectations that you laid out for charge-offs? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes, that\u2019s a good question. I mean I think the first thing I would say, when you were saying blended, if you were speaking about investors on a blended basis, I think that their profile is actually quite good. And when you look back in different cycles, their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours, but the regional bank peer set. So \u2013 and given the collateralization, etcetera, and a number of other things that help that profile. So, pound-for-pound, they come on with a slightly lower ACL and CECL hit to what CFG standalone is not by a lot, and they are smaller, so it won\u2019t have a huge impact, but they come in a little lower than and call it, the 143 that where we are. So, from that perspective, it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis. CECL day one was 147, we are at 143. We have cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the end of \u201819 when CECL was adopted, and there has been significant as we mentioned earlier, and we have in the slide deck in the appendix, significant improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then. So, you could see some opportunity all else equal for back book needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down. I think all of the variability will be on loan growth. And so we are just going to provide for our loan growth and all-in probably be a little lower than we are here, but not by a lot.\nBruce Van Saun: The other wildcard, obviously, Ken, is what is the kind of long-term or the medium-term macro forecast look like and can the Fed engineer a soft landing. Is there a higher possibility of recession, which could change that dynamic somewhat. But I think, certainly, right now, with respect to 2022, we feel really good about how we are positioned from a credit standpoint. I would \u2013 if you ask me to make a call, I would say it\u2019s unlikely we will have a recession in \u201822. So, at least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while. Whether we can still show net benefits on the provision line, I think those days are probably numbered. But in any case, I think there is still going to be good numbers. And as John said, the ACL may tick down a little more from here, but kind of starting to feel like we are not going to go a huge amount lower.\nKen Usdin: Yes. And Bruce, as a follow-up to that, it was nice to see the commercial line utilization up 150 basis points you talked about. You are reiterating your full year loan growth guidance. Just wondering if you can give us some on-the-ground color about business activity, supply chain constraints? Just in terms of \u2013 and also the trade-off possibly between loans going on the balance sheet versus out the door in capital markets. And just kind of a feel for just how the commercial side of the economy is feeling and how that influences your views on commercial growth? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Let me just say a word and then Don really has the best color. But clearly, it\u2019s nice to see the line utilization pick up. Some of it is a little defensive in nature. So, people have been worried about their supply chain and inventory levels. And so when they can get a hold of the materials that they need to go out and buy it. So, I would say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver and a little of that also is inflation, which is causing those materials to cost more. So, that would be, I would say, number one. There is still \u2013 people doing deals, doing smaller deals and playing offense in terms of growth. There is a little bit of that kicking in as well. I think what continues to give us confidence is the thing that Don mentioned earlier that there is private capital has amassed tons of firepower to put to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done. And so there is still deal-related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth. But with that, let me turn it over to Don.\nDon McCree: Yes. So, I think you covered most of it. And back to the second half of the question, a lot of the capital markets activity we do is in the leverage buyout area and things like that. So, that\u2019s an origination for distribution business, which it should be. We don\u2019t want a lot of that on our balance sheet, and we continue to maintain average holds of about $12 million in our sponsor business. So, very diversified, very careful from a risk profile. I will say that the utilization trend that we are seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in mid-April. So, that trend really is driven by cost of goods. So, there is an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling. But the broader question is we are hearing generally positive things from our customers. Credit quality, as we said, feels pretty good. There is a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of an ability to pass on cost increases where they ire seeing them. But remember that these companies have been through hell over the last 2 years with the pandemic, and they have cut their costs. They have restructured their businesses and they are entering whatever we are entering, whether it would be a slowdown or something that\u2019s just slower growth in a much better position from a management standpoint than they were just 2 years ago. So, that gives us a lot of confidence. And certain clients are being opportunistic where they are seeing, as Bruce said, where they are seeing competitors that are slightly weakened, we are seeing a little bit of M&A activity in the middle market channels that are companies are buying each other right now.\nBruce Van Saun: The one last thing you might also add Don is on subscription line financing some of the securitization\u2026\nDon McCree: Yes. So, we are seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant volume in our asset-backed securities businesses in the warehouses. So, those markets are very strong and we continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities.\nKen Usdin: Great. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. I appreciate the color you gave there in terms of the commercial drivers and the trend behind the demand. Are you able to perhaps help unpack the high-single digit loan growth expectation ex the deal and ex-PPP for 2022 in terms of how you think about C&I growth and perhaps growth in your CRE portfolio as well? Thanks.\nDon McCree: Yes. So, why don\u2019t I start with that. So, we are down to basically almost nothing on the C&I side on PPP. So, that\u2019s in the rearview mirror. So, that\u2019s not in any of our loan growth projections. So, the loan growth that we have referenced is really CFG loan growth. We have assumed a little bit of growth on the investors bank side, but not a lot for the rest of \u201822. So, all the comments we are making are CFG specific. I would say subscription lines are growing the fastest. C&I is growing the second fastest and CRE, we are seeing very, very modest growth. And we are basically on our pre business really still focused on purpose-built office, industrial and life science and a little bit of multifamily, but not a lot. We are really off risk on hospitality and retail. So, not a lot of CRE business there. The issue that we are fighting and continue to fight although it\u2019s getting a little bit better is our originations are really strong, and we are seeing lots of activity both coming into the book and also in the pipeline, but pay-downs have been quite high. And this was the first quarter where we saw pay-downs begin to decline. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit of the volatility in the capital markets, maybe that\u2019s a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now, but we are seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower pay-downs, which were running very, very high last year for almost the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that we are receiving.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then separately, on the credit side, I just have a question there. In terms of the increase in the NPAs and the increase in the 90-day delinquencies, I know you indicated that\u2019s mainly mortgage coming off forbearance. Just want to give you \u2013 if you could give us a little color in terms of your confidence there in terms of the resolution of those items? And then separately, in minds of faster-than-expected credit normalization on the consumer side, perhaps in your merchant partnerships or anything? Thanks.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, it\u2019s Brendan. I can take that. On the mortgage side, this is fully expected. These are sort of an administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time. We have done extensive analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance on to a full repayment schedule and its de minimis. Especially on the mortgage side, we have got very significant coverage on our loan to value. And so we feel really confident in that. Just broadly on the consumer book, we haven\u2019t seen much of any early signs that we are starting to see a tick up in return to normal. We are expecting one, but the delinquency levels generally remain in very strong spot and significantly depressed. Some of the newer portfolios that we have talked a lot about over the years on these calls and others around student loans and merchant point-of-sale maintain incredible strength and have not shown any signs of uptick in early delinquencies whatsoever. So, we feel really confident around the outlook, the state of credit and consumers that the lowest levels it\u2019s ever been, and we continue to sort of beat to the positive almost every month on what we are seeing on NTO. So, I feel really good. And I think \u2013 and when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer, they are still showing a lot of excess liquidity, the money in consumer checking accounts is still at all-time highs, really hasn\u2019t moved down. While we are seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things, it\u2019s not adding to outstanding. So, in order to believe that you will start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line, I think you would have to see some deflation on the excess cash built up in the consumers\u2019 wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables building up in the credit card. So, we haven\u2019t seen that. So, all the early indicators just aren\u2019t moving yet. Of course, we do expect it will, but just right now, it\u2019s not. So, we will take it.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, John, is all the early warning signs are flash and green, which is great. So, on the consumer side, delinquency roll rates, some of the things Brendan quoted, all appear really, really good. Similarly, on the commercial side, the crit/class ratio continues to go down and the heightened. There is very few credits that are in heightened monitoring. So, that also bodes well for the future. You can \u2013 at these very low levels for things like charge-offs and NPAs you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit. But overall, we feel really, really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year.\nJohn Pancari: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.\nPeter Winter: Thanks. I was just curious, are there any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio just given the rising rates or any plans to move any of it into like held to maturity or hedge some of this?\nJohn Woods: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. I mean I think we are in about a little bit less than 10%, call it, high-single digits with HCM, if you \u2013 in the first quarter. I think you will see that, that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of things that we are doing. We are putting a lot of securities to work just in CFG standalone, just given the environment, now that there is a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of 300% yields, just on standalone. And then we are, of course \u2013 we have closed on the acquisition of investors and there is about $4 billion of securities there that we are rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kind of securities that we own. So, there is lots of opportunities to address that, and you are likely to see the HCM percentage rise in the second quarter.\nPeter Winter: Okay. Thanks. And then just secondly, just on the HSBC acquisition, I think at the time of the announcement in May, there was about $9 billion in deposits and you closed it with $6.3 billion in deposits. Do you think at these levels, deposits hold steady, you can grow them? Just \u2013 if you could just talk about that change in the outlook.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Pre legal day one, the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of international customers that we are rotating into banks that have more global capabilities. And so the good news on that is that we didn\u2019t pay premium of any kind for those customers that we weren\u2019t really going to get at our core. We had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition post legal day one than you would normally expect in a deal like that, given the profile of the customers that were banking at HSBC. The good news is since legal day one, it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated pre-legal day one, and we have seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level with good sales, very strong sales and normal expected is in outflows on the back book. And so we do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we ramp up our marketing activities, which would obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side offsetting some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one. So, we feel really, really good on the early signs that we are seeing here we are six weeks or seven weeks in.\nJohn Woods: Just to add, we had the transition pre legal day one that we didn\u2019t have to pay for it, and it produces the trend with the attrition happening post legal day one. I just want to add that plan.\nPeter Winter: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nGerard Cassidy: Bruce, you said in your opening comments that obviously, the focus this year is to integrate the acquisitions you did in the Metro New York marketplace, but in the wealth space, if something was priced right that would be something you would consider. Thinking about the Florida franchise as you build that out, if a depository came up at attractive pricing and, again, I know you have played is full with what you are doing in New York, is that something that you could consider, or you really know, we just we are going to wait until we get these things fully integrated before we consider a deposit deal?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I don\u2019t see us looking at a depository there anytime soon. I think we have got enough on our plate that getting off to this really great start and launching New York Metro is job one. We do have a strategy in Florida that I think is interesting. So, we had a couple of de novo wealth centers, one in Palm Beach and one in Naples that we focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can really make some traction in those markets. And then we had five or six come over from HSBC, very attractive locations and branches with good staffing in the Miami area. And so again, that\u2019s job one is to try to really make that work, what we have and really drive up the performance of those sites and keep getting smart in the market and keep talking to people, keep trying to figure out kind of where with the next city where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share. So, that\u2019s to me, the focus, and we will keep trying to get smart on the market, but let\u2019s suggest what we have and make that productive. The other point I would make with respect to Florida and elsewhere where we are kind of outside of our core footprint is we are investing heavily in the digital bank. And very recently, we have migrated to a new cloud-based core platform, which is really exciting for us, it\u2019s going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate those offerings on the digital platform. And so that\u2019s kind of also twinned with some light branches in markets like Florida, can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms. And then over time, we will figure out what physical presence do we need to complement those digital offerings. So, it\u2019s pretty exciting. We have a similar opportunity in the Greater Washington area, where we picked up, I think it\u2019s nine or ten branches from HSBC. So, we can try to attack that market through digital and decide is nine or ten the right number, are they in the right locations, do we need to alter that and then using test and learning from Florida and from DC. Are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing digital presence combined with some thin branch presence.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good Bruce, and to pivot the next question is on deposits. How do you guys weigh and you talked about how certificates of deposits have come down dramatically. You have got a very strong DDA balance core now much higher than when you went public, of course. But with rates moving up so quickly now in the 10 year is almost at 3% today, when does long-term funding with low-cost CDs make sense? And then Don, when do your customers start asking for higher compensating balances as rates move up? Have you guys seen more discussions there as well on the compensating balances on the commercial side?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I will go ahead and start a couple of thoughts there. I mean I think that as you heard from Brendan earlier, and you saw on our Slide 7, our CD portfolio is much smaller than it was before. And what that \u2013 at the start, and I think what the point there is that CDs could be part of the story. And we would do it in a way that\u2019s connected to a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach, which is I think how things got played out early in the last cycle for us, whereas this cycle is all going to be about customer relationships. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle, we expect CD betas to be lower during the cycle and part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go. The last cycle took a longer time, 2 years to 3 years. And so you kept getting that ratcheted up cost of CDs every time they came to maturity. So, I do think CDs can be part of the story given deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle, CDs can absolutely be something a tool that will utilize coming off a lower base. So, that\u2019s the first point. And the second point is that on the commercial side, you will have balanced migration, that\u2019s natural as compensating balances that don\u2019t need to be quite as high to get as earnings credit rates actually rise over time. So yes, there will be some of that migration that\u2019s built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into our deposit costs overall. And so \u2013 but it\u2019s the same point there that given the number of ways that we can interact with our customers on the commercial side, we are deepening our relationships there and expect that those migrations will be well controlled and as expected.\nDon McCree: Yes. I think that\u2019s exactly right. And we have actually gone out over the last month or so with a full or information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship, with all of our relationship managers. So, we are well on top of it. We have had some people pull deposits, but we haven\u2019t had a problem backfilling and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Thank you for the color.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Alright. I think that\u2019s it for the questions in the queue. And let me just close by thanking everybody again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I will start with our headlines for the quarter. We have reported underlying net income of $476 million and EPS of $1.07. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter, driven by strong loan growth and a 9 basis point improvement in margin. Period-end loan growth was up a solid 2% linked quarter. Our retail loans are up about 3%, while commercial loans are up 2% or 3% ex-PPP impacts. Average loans are up 3% linked quarter paced by commercial, up 3% or 4% ex-PPP and retail up 3%. Fees were down 16% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets fees off a record prior quarter given market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull-forward of transactions into the fourth quarter. On a positive note, we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we help clients manage through the volatile environment. We remain disciplined on expenses, which were up 3% sequentially, excluding acquisitions, reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts. Year-over-year expenses were up a modest 2% excluding acquisitions. We recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of $21 million, which reflects strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive though we are monitoring whether Fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy. The underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes $24 million for the double count of Day 1 CECL provision expense tied to the HSBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, down slightly from 1.51% at the end of 2021 and the 1.47% Day 1 CECL level. Our tangible book value per share was down 10.5% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates of securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.7% after a 20 basis point impact from the HSBC transaction. Next, I will provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on Slide 6 was up 2%, given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the approximately $41 million combined impact from lower day count and the reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness. The net interest margin was 2.75%, up 9 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front book yields rising, which more than offset reduced PPP benefit. Margin is also benefiting from lower cash balances as we continue to redeploy some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. Of note, PPP spot loans were down to roughly $400 million at quarter end and forgiveness benefit headwinds are substantially behind us. We made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are now 10 basis points, an all-time low, down 3 basis points linked quarter. Moving to Slide 7, given the Fed's recent rate hike and the expectation for Fed funds rate to end the year in the 225 to 250 basis points range, we thought it would be helpful to discuss why we are confident that we will realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. We entered this rate cycle with a much higher level of asset sensitivity at 10% before the first rate hike in March. This is already starting to benefit NII in the first quarter and is driving the significant improvement in our full year outlook and those benefits will continue to accumulate into 2023. Importantly, our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely transformed our funding base since the IPO. We are beginning the current up-cycle with a very strong liquidity profile. Our LDR is much lower. Our deposit costs are as low as they have ever been and our overall funding profile was greatly improved. Our period end demand deposits are now 32% of the book compared with 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. And within our interest-bearing deposits, our consumer CDs are now less than 3% of total deposits compared with about 10% at the start of the last cycle. We are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding. This improved deposit profile reflects the significant improvements we have made to our deposit franchise since the IPO with improved and expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings. We have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract and retain more stable deposits. With a better starting position and the improvements in our deposit mix and capabilities, we expect our interest-bearing beta to be about 35% over this freight cycle, which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at 7% at the end of the first quarter. This is down modestly from 10% at the end of 4Q, with the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impact of our higher NII outlook given the benefits from the April 6 forward curve and the evolution in the balance sheet. Pro forma from the Investors acquisition, asset sensitivity is slightly over 6%. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the bottom left side of this page, we have given you an estimate of our sensitivity to further changes in rates either up or down from the forward curve. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $20 million to $25 million a quarter, with most of that coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve. This includes the pro forma impact of Investors. Moving on to Slide 8, we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses and we drove solid performance across other key categories. Capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility, seasonal impacts and some pull forward into the full fourth quarter of 2021. Given the strength of our pipelines, capital markets fees could rebound nicely as markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. Demonstrating the diversity of our business, we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets, a 46% linked quarter as we worked with clients to manage their foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity exposures. Mortgage fees were down 9% linked quarter against a backdrop of lower industry origination volumes, given rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition and excess industry capacity continue to pressure margins. Mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Card fees and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality. Debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels and wealth fees also remain strong. On Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 3% linked quarter and just 2% year-on-year, excluding acquisitions. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is well underway, targeting $100 million of pre-tax run-rate benefits by the end of the year. Period-end loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 2% or 3% ex-PPP. Average loans were up 3% linked quarter. Driving this was average commercial loan growth of 3% or 4% ex-PPP impacts, led by C&I with growth across almost every region, including our expansion markets. Average retail growth was also 3%. Line utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about 150 basis points to a little over 36% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking led by manufacturing and trade as companies look to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and facilitate some M&A activity. On Slide 11, our period end deposits were up 3% linked quarter as we added $6.3 billion of lower cost deposits with the HSBC transaction. Excluding HSBC, period end and average deposits were down slightly, given seasonal impacts as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels. Moving on to credit on Slide 12, we saw an excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were up slightly at 19 basis points for the first quarter, with good performance across the portfolio. Non-performing loans increased by $87 million linked quarter, primarily driven by residential real estate secured loans exiting forbearance. Other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans were lower. While we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession, we feel good about the improvements in the portfolio we have made over the last few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk. In the appendix on Slide 21, you will see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved given changes through the pandemic, including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger mid-corporate credit portfolio, which is higher rated as well as reductions in stressed sectors such as retail malls, education and casual dining. On the retail side, we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segments. Our risk profile has improved given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix, including the runoff of our personal and secured product. Of note, the Investors portfolios have performed well in prior cycles and we feel good about them. Moving to Slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.7% at the end of the first quarter after closing the HSBC transaction, which had a 20 basis point impact. We also wanted to mention that we have widened our target CET1 operating range to 9.5% to 10% from 9.75% to 10%, reflective of the continued progress we have made in improving profitability, revenue diversity and overall risk management. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed as you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit, on Slide 14, you will see some examples of the progress we have made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of Investors at the beginning of April, further expanding the foothold we established in the New York City Metro area through the HSBC branch transaction and significantly advancing our growth plans. In the consumer business, we were excited to complete the upgrade of Citizens Access to a fully cloud-enabled core platform, which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our multiyear objective of convergence with our core banking platforms. We also recently announced Citizens ever value checking, a new overdraft free checking account designed to meet bank on national account standards and increased banking access for underserved communities. On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the TOP 10 as a middle-market and sponsor book runner. On the right side of the page, we have included some digital metrics. We are very excited with how our digital first approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions, we provided a comprehensive update to our 2022 guidance on Slide 15. The good news here is that our guide is up for our standalone business. Rates are helping NII more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees. So, PPNR is higher and there is no change in our positive view on credit and we remain confident in the outlook for the bank deals. I will focus my comments on the full year outlook, including both HSBC and investors, but we have also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance. We have also included a comparison to our original guide from January to help highlight what is driving the overall improvement in the full year outlook. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of April 6, which implies a Fed Fund's target of 225 to 250 basis points by the end of the year. On the long end, this rate curve implies the 10-year treasury to be about 270 basis points at the end of the year. It is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full year effect upside to NII in 2023. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 27% to 30% driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid average loan growth of 20% to 22%. On a standalone basis, NII is about $290 million to $330 million better than our prior guidance given the higher rates. Average interest-earning assets are expected to be up 14% to 16%. Fee income is expected to be up 3% to 7%. On a standalone basis, fee revenue will be about $100 million lower than the January guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue as well as capital markets somewhat. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 16% to 18% given the full year effect of HSBC and Investors as well as our commercial fee-based acquisitions. Credit is expected to remain excellent with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly for the year and we expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of about 9.75%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. Our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items for the year, including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our TOP 7 costs. You can see those in the appendix on Slide 20. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, excluding the acquisitions. And if you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be over 4% operating leverage. Including acquisitions, we expect operating leverage of over 4% and over 7%, excluding PPP. Overall, we expect our full year ROTCE to land solidly within our 14% to 16% medium-term target range. Moving to Slide 15, I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter. On a standalone basis, we expect NII to be up 6% to 8%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. With the bank acquisitions, we expect NII to be up 27% to 29%. On a standalone basis, average loans are expected to be up 1% to 2%, led by commercial, with interest-earning assets up slightly. Fees are expected to be up 3% to 5% on a standalone basis, reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits. Including the acquisitions, fees are expected to be up 7% to 9%. Non-interest expense on a standalone basis is expected to be up 1% to 2% given higher revenue-based compensation. Including the acquisitions, expenses are expected to be up 12% to 13%. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, and we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%. To sum up with Slide 17 and 18, we started \u201822 with a solid quarter. We have a winning strategy and are well positioned to succeed given the strength and diversity of our businesses. We are very optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and strong loan growth. Our capital markets business is well-positioned as markets stabilize and we are very excited about the opportunity to grow our business in the New York Metro region as we integrate and build on HSBC and Investors. We will continue to focus on execution and building a top performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I will hand it back over to Bruce. Yes. I will go ahead and start off on that. I mean I think you had number of impacts there that we are building into the guide. I'd say that we mentioned our $100 million guide over guide, which is driven primarily by mortgage. But there is some capital markets implications there as well given the fact that 1Q, we had some pull forward into the fourth quarter. If you look back at the fourth quarter, we had a record quarter, but our pipelines look excellent. And so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year. But as markets stabilize, we really think that the momentum there is strong. And so maybe Don can cover. So did you say asset sensitivity or was it just \u2013 I missed the... Yes. I mean, I'd say that the \u2013 we mentioned our $20 million to $25 million per instantaneous 25 rate hike, and that's really an average. So you get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end of it. And that's really driven by deposit betas, which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first 100. And then that starts to build into the second 100 and then beyond. So yes, I think you will see possibly a bit more on the front end. When we're seeing those lag effect in deposit betas contribute a touch more and then it will be a little lower on the back end. I will mention is the other point that 20% to 25% is an average, but it's also a first year average. And so there is actually more upside when you get into \u2013 even if it's instantaneous, you still get a lag effect benefit from the asset side as well as assets reprice. So you might see, for example, in year 2, even for an instantaneous 25 basis point change, you would see upside from there in the 15% to 20% range on top of that as you get into rolling year 2. Yes. Thanks, Erika. I think if you're on Page 7, I mean, I think that the drivers there are that we're entering this cycle were much better positioned than the last cycle. When you think about just the starting point with interest-bearing deposit costs being at 10 basis points, an all-time low for us, we started the last cycle at 34 basis points. And the balance sheet position, the mix on the deposit side is much better with 32% noninterest-bearing. So we feel \u2013 just we're much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around. We still benefited from rising rates last time around, by the way, but we're much better prepared to benefit from this side around \u2013 this time around on deposit betas, given all of the strength on the balance sheet. I'd say when you ask about balance sheet, I mean, I think \u2013 and swaps, you really have to think about in the context of the entire balance sheet. So we do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out. That will decline over time as NII keeps rising, as I mentioned in my remarks, the denominator effect as we update and increase our NII, that alone reduces the percentage of further benefit that could occur for future rate hikes, just dollar for dollar, it's fine, but the percentages fall. But I do think that there is significant firepower left, both with respect to the balance sheet loan growth part of the story as well as much more hedging left to do before asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral. So that's how I would describe it. I mean in terms of deposit betas, again, 2022, you're going to see a lot of lag, a lot of lag in the first 100. It will start to catch up maybe in the second 100. And then if we really do get to 300 basis points in Fed funds, you'll see some of that catch up in 2023. And then I'll just close out with our conversation about NII being up $290 million to $330 million guide over guide is an important thing to focus on, and that's on a gradual rate rising scenario. It may be \u2013 it could be \u2013 it's much higher in a full year effect when you get to 2023 approaching maybe 2x that. Yes. Great question, Brian. I appreciate it. I think that if you basically look at excellent opportunities for our deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved. And I think if you separate the expectation for \u2013 as rates rise, there is some impact on how those deposits play out. There is also the surge deposits that came in, in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought when they first showed up. I do think more broadly when you think about the macro, deposits have grown consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios even through quantitative tightening and the like, the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug along. So we're optimistic that the industry as a whole and we, in particular, given our significantly expanded product capabilities, we will be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both consumer and commercial side. So maybe I'll just turn it over to Brendan and then maybe Don. Yes, I'll start off on securities and maybe Brendan can take mortgage. But I can tell you, overall, that it's not swap activity that's having an impact on either of those. And as it relates to securities, just to give you a sense, there is two dynamics going on there. One is the front book where current yields on the stuff coming into the portfolio are north of 3%. So we're in the 300 to 330 basis point range, that's a driver in 1Q. It wasn't at that level during 1Q, but it was well over 2%. It was probably 230 to 250 during the first quarter, and that was compared to maybe 175 in 4Q. So that's the dynamic you're seeing 1.75 in 4Q, 2.30-ish in 1Q and announced over 3%. So that will continue into the second quarter. The other dynamic is the back book premium amortization tends \u2013 declines when rates rise. So you're seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book. And so that's the driver there. And maybe Brendan can talk about mortgages. I'll just start off there. I mean I think that the securities book and investors looks as a profile that we would migrate and frankly, have already been migrating to our profile, which is mostly clean duration plus mortgage-backed securities, agency-type paper. So we've been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front. In general, we like the loan book that comes over from investors has performed well from a credit perspective. They have a nice core portfolio over there. Maybe Don can talk about anything else that might be migrated at the margin. Other than \u2013 I will say, Matt, on my side, we are doing roughly $1 billion to $1.2 billion of DSO adjustments on the Citizens side, and you will see us do some of that as we move around low-yielding assets that we might be acquiring, but we don't have full plans on that yet. Well, I mean I would look at it as what Don and Brendan has been able to accomplish when we go into expansion markets, right, in particular, Don's business and commercial when we entered the Southeast is a good playbook for how we have been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over time. So, I think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and conversion, and we have been able to make our investments that we plan to make in New York Metro. I would suspect for a number of years, you could see the growth rates once that all settles out and baseline, you can see those growth rates actually being higher than Citizens standalone for a number of years until it balances out in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that metro. Yes, that's a good question. I mean I think the first thing I would say, when you were saying blended, if you were speaking about investors on a blended basis, I think that their profile is actually quite good. And when you look back in different cycles, their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours, but the regional bank peer set. So \u2013 and given the collateralization, etcetera, and a number of other things that help that profile. So, pound-for-pound, they come on with a slightly lower ACL and CECL hit to what CFG standalone is not by a lot, and they are smaller, so it won't have a huge impact, but they come in a little lower than and call it, the 143 that where we are. So, from that perspective, it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis. CECL day one was 147, we are at 143. We have cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the end of \u201819 when CECL was adopted, and there has been significant as we mentioned earlier, and we have in the slide deck in the appendix, significant improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then. So, you could see some opportunity all else equal for back book needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down. I think all of the variability will be on loan growth. And so we are just going to provide for our loan growth and all-in probably be a little lower than we are here, but not by a lot. Yes, it's a good question. I mean I think we are in about a little bit less than 10%, call it, high-single digits with HCM, if you \u2013 in the first quarter. I think you will see that, that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of things that we are doing. We are putting a lot of securities to work just in CFG standalone, just given the environment, now that there is a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of 300% yields, just on standalone. And then we are, of course \u2013 we have closed on the acquisition of investors and there is about $4 billion of securities there that we are rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kind of securities that we own. So, there is lots of opportunities to address that, and you are likely to see the HCM percentage rise in the second quarter. Just to add, we had the transition pre legal day one that we didn't have to pay for it, and it produces the trend with the attrition happening post legal day one. I just want to add that plan."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes, I think it's a tale of a couple of different cities. So, one thing we are seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan market, the syndicated loan market. So, while the bond market is particularly high yield and the equity markets have been pretty much close for the last few months, we are seeing some rotation into the syndicated loan markets as the liquidity there kind of rebuild and you have seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the last couple of days actually. And that's been quite supportive. So, I think the second quarter will be really a story about syndicated lending. And then if we get a reduction in volatility, we think we are going to begin to see the bond markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen. I will say what John said, which is our pitch activity, our pipelines and our mandates are extremely strong. And so, it's really a matter of waiting for the constructive in the markets to return and then we will begin to bring deals. And we saw three or four deals start to emerge last week, which we were on and we feel pretty good about, particularly in the back half of the year. Yes. I will also just amplify that, Bruce, to say a lot of our capital markets and M&A activity surrounds private equity. So, private equity is still flushed with cash and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the market right now. So, it's a matter of matching sellers kind of desires and buyers desires and that will just take a little time to kind of work through the system. Yes. And I'll just emphasize, Bruce, what you said in terms of \u2013 we've gone through a complete reconstruction of our treasury service business. So it was frankly a basket case 6 years ago. And now I would put it up against any other company's treasury service business, and that's driving an above trend growth rate, 7% to 10% in terms of year-on-year growth and also driving a skew towards non-interest-bearing deposits. And we didn't even have a deposit team 6 years ago. And now we have a built-out team, which has got fantastic analytics and bringing new offerings like green deposits in the ESG agenda and also building a liquidity portal. So, it's a totally different place and we're seeing the results in terms of deposit levels, and we're seeing the skew towards non-interest-bearing also. Yes. I'll just \u2013 I think I said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that business. But also remember, we're expanding aggressively in terms of our client base. So we're in expansion markets. We're adding a lot of clients and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs. So we feel pretty good about it. But I'll go back to what Brendan said also, it's really a matter of the day-to-day balancing of volume versus cost and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital. So it's something that we manage carefully, but I feel confident that we're going to continue to expand the deposit base. Yes. There are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward, but it's not going to be quick and aggressive. We are going to do it \u2013 we are going to migrate it over time. But a lot of the business that they do is very diversifying for us. They are in different elements of the CRE business than we are. So, it looks quite different. And then a lot of the C&I business is smaller company business banking, and we are looking to grow that segment as we move forward. So, you will see some adjustment at the margin, but no aggressive asset sales, I think out blocks. Yes, balance sheet, optimization and... Yes. John, I will also add that they have a very limited product set on the C&I side. So, bringing in the variety of products that we can offer and capabilities that we can offer, we think there is an opportunity to go after larger companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way. Yes. So, I think you covered most of it. And back to the second half of the question, a lot of the capital markets activity we do is in the leverage buyout area and things like that. So, that's an origination for distribution business, which it should be. We don't want a lot of that on our balance sheet, and we continue to maintain average holds of about $12 million in our sponsor business. So, very diversified, very careful from a risk profile. I will say that the utilization trend that we are seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in mid-April. So, that trend really is driven by cost of goods. So, there is an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling. But the broader question is we are hearing generally positive things from our customers. Credit quality, as we said, feels pretty good. There is a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of an ability to pass on cost increases where they ire seeing them. But remember that these companies have been through hell over the last 2 years with the pandemic, and they have cut their costs. They have restructured their businesses and they are entering whatever we are entering, whether it would be a slowdown or something that's just slower growth in a much better position from a management standpoint than they were just 2 years ago. So, that gives us a lot of confidence. And certain clients are being opportunistic where they are seeing, as Bruce said, where they are seeing competitors that are slightly weakened, we are seeing a little bit of M&A activity in the middle market channels that are companies are buying each other right now. Yes. So, we are seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant volume in our asset-backed securities businesses in the warehouses. So, those markets are very strong and we continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities. Yes. So, why don't I start with that. So, we are down to basically almost nothing on the C&I side on PPP. So, that's in the rearview mirror. So, that's not in any of our loan growth projections. So, the loan growth that we have referenced is really CFG loan growth. We have assumed a little bit of growth on the investors bank side, but not a lot for the rest of \u201822. So, all the comments we are making are CFG specific. I would say subscription lines are growing the fastest. C&I is growing the second fastest and CRE, we are seeing very, very modest growth. And we are basically on our pre business really still focused on purpose-built office, industrial and life science and a little bit of multifamily, but not a lot. We are really off risk on hospitality and retail. So, not a lot of CRE business there. The issue that we are fighting and continue to fight although it's getting a little bit better is our originations are really strong, and we are seeing lots of activity both coming into the book and also in the pipeline, but pay-downs have been quite high. And this was the first quarter where we saw pay-downs begin to decline. Maybe that's a little bit of the volatility in the capital markets, maybe that's a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now, but we are seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower pay-downs, which were running very, very high last year for almost the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that we are receiving. Yes. I think that's exactly right. And we have actually gone out over the last month or so with a full or information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship, with all of our relationship managers. So, we are well on top of it. We have had some people pull deposits, but we haven't had a problem backfilling and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call today. There clearly have been changes in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year, along with significant volatility. We feel we have executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of 2022. Among the highlights of the quarter, we had a successful conversion of the HSBC branch and online customers, which was then followed by closing the Investors acquisition on April 6. We continue to take actions to position our balance sheet well for rising rates and we have made further progress on our strategic initiatives, including our digital agenda and TOP 7 program. With respect to our financial results, we are off to a good start with underlying EPS of $1.07 and ROTCE of 13%. This is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of payroll taxes on expenses. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, given 3% average loan growth and higher NIM, which more than offset a sizable drag from lower PPP loan forgiveness revenue and day count. We saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgage given the environment, though high volatility benefited our Global Markets hedging business. We maintained strong deal pipelines in capital markets and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pickup if markets stabilize. We managed expenses well in the quarter and turnover has normalized somewhat. Credit metrics are all excellent and so far both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the current challenges. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with a CET1 ratio of 9.7%. We have the capacity to grow loans, pursue fee-based bolt-on acquisitions, raise our dividend in the second half of the year and buyback some stock. Our loan growth has picked up on the commercial side and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto a little, which will maintain an attractive LDR. I'd like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for investors at the moment. First, and to be clear, we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates. Our funding base is vastly improved from where it was entering the last rate up-cycle. We have a 7% benefit from a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates, a 10 basis point cost of interest-bearing deposits and an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio. We project roughly $300 million in higher NII given the current curve, which annualizes to much more in 2023. This will more than offset roughly $100 million in lower fee income from the environment. John will take you through this in detail in his remarks. Second, while inflation pressures are real and the possibility of recession in 2023 has increased, we feel our credit risk position is in very good shape. We have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in consumer and over time we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have better credit profiles. As a result, our overall credit profile has improved over time. Our real-life and CCAR stress test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle of the super regional pack and we have carefully assessed investors' credit book and loss history and remain confident in their positioning, which we will further harmonize over time. Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, I would like to highlight that our focus in \u201822 is on integrating the acquisitions that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start, particularly our New York City Metro area initiative. We will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space, but we are highly disciplined acquirer and have not been able to get much done as a result. With respect to Florida, we now have 8 branches in the state and job one is bringing them to network performance levels. There does not appear to be much to do that's attractive inorganically and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the road. In short, you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline we have exhibited since the IPO. All-in-all, we feel very good about how we have started the year and how we are positioned to navigate the challenging environment. Given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions, we have provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models. We continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders. And with that, I will turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A. The other thing you didn't mention is the M&A pipeline, which I think still looks really, really good. And again there, if the market stabilized a little bit, I think we will start to pull those deals through and it's typically seasonal that the fourth quarter is huge, which it was for us in 2021. And then the first quarter is usually softer seasonally, pipelines look good. And I think as the year goes, we should see a nice build in M&A revenue. Yes, good. And I would just add, Erika, that we've been I think, very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do significant additional swaps we've done a bit. But anyway, we're still, I think, of the view that rates could go even higher here. So feel good about how we're positioned right now. Yes. There is a lot in that. I'll try to unpack that, Erika. But I think partly the \u2013 our objective here is to continue to perform well through cycles. And so we're a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team. And so I think when the market goes into a risk thought posture, some assumptions how are they going to do, we're not as \u2013 we don't have the historical track record of some of our peers, I think. I think we've done a good job of dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic, and our credit performance was very good. I think there was some concern for law that we've grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get releveraged after the IPO and was that going to end in tiers. And we've said all along and we've been very disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital, and I think that's borne fruit. I think now with an up cycle, at the beginning of the year when the environment looked like rates were going to go up gradually to use a Goldilocks example, that was the page was just right scenario. And so our stock performed quite well out of the chute. I think once it became clear that the Fed was behind the curve and was going to start to raise rates much more aggressively, I think then you kind of tipped into it, well, maybe the is too hot. And will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefit from higher rates. And I think, again, with all the work we've done and analysis we've provided, we're quite confident that the liability side of this bank is much, much better than it's ever been. We've done a lot of hard work on that. And so we still think whether the path is fast or whether it's more gradual, we're going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates. I'd say also on fees, there is probably a concern that we've built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in capital markets and mortgage is kind of a big fee elements for us. Having said that, I think you've seen that there is good diversity in our fees. And so in a pandemic period, when capital markets were a bit softer, mortgage revenues were really, really strong, given lower rates, and we see \u2013 we can see that flip around. But I think the fact that we've assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and have targeted focus on private capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that really are the engine of the economy, technology, health care with our JMP acquisition, I think we're very confident that we can grow revenue sustainably in capital markets and they'll move around a little bit from quarter-to-quarter. But I think the trend line is upwards and to the right. And again, on the mortgage business, I think we've built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across wholesale channels in our retail channel. I think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by building market share. So we plan to hire more this year. So I think all of these aspects are take time for the market to come around and fully appreciate, and we will just keep doing what we're doing and putting up good results and executing well. And then I think, ultimately, the stock will take care of itself. With respect to the non-interest-bearing liabilities, I mean, the DDAs as a percentage of the total deposit base is up to about 32%. I think when I walked in the door at the time of the IPO that was probably in the low 20s. So that's been a dramatic improvement, focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on the consumer side and then also on the commercial side actually just building out our capabilities and investing in our core platform and cash management offering. And so it's just been a gradual improvement over time as we enhanced our abilities and our targeting and we've had nice growth as a result. So I think I'll stop there. Does anybody want to add to that, Brendan, do you want to talk about consumer deposits and Don on the commercial? Yes. So we're giving you a long-winded answer, Erika, but I wanted to just come back to the last thing you touched on which was ROTCE and also our capital targets. So I think we're pleased that we can say that we will be solidly in the range for our medium-term targets this year, the 14% to 16%. And you can see that where we were in the first quarter, that should ramp, and so we could be even stronger, I think, as we exit the year. So feel very good about that. We did move the targets from 9.75 to 10 to 9.5 to 10. So we moved them modestly. I'm still a big believer in being somewhat conservative on the capital, particularly as, as I said, we're a relatively new company. And so I think all our stakeholders from maybe being slightly higher than our peers. But if you look at it over time, we've been converging to peers. And honestly, when you look at the CCAR results and our risk profile, there is no reason that longer term we will need to have that premium. Sure. Good morning. Yes. I'd say it's kind of a factor of a number of considerations. One is that we're already seeing very strong loan demand on the commercial side. We're seeing line utilization tick up. So there can be somewhat of a rotation over into more growth on commercial. Therefore, when we look at consumer and in the higher rate environment, some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage aren't what they used to be. And so we can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side. And we could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets, but we think we don't need to do that at this point. We've got NIM going up. The rate hikes is providing a big lift. And if the marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isn't hitting our hurdles, and we have no problem backing off that. The net result of that is that, that benefits the LDR versus keeping the pedal to the floor. So we think that's a trade-off we're taking. Yes. Let me start off and then maybe John and Brendan can add on the yield question. But we've been \u2013 historically, since the IPO, we've had a relatively higher LDR that we worked hard to bring down from the high 90s down into the mid-90s. And then with this big influx of liquidity into the market, we've been able to bring the LDR back down to 80-ish and it's inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that we're experiencing. I think we should still be able to manage that in the \u201880s, and I can't really call exactly where that's likely to be partly depends on the amount of loan growth that we see. But I think just the way we, over time, brought it from high 90s down into mid-90s and I think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity. So that would be my answer there. John, maybe you want to pick up the yields? Yes. Let me just chime in here as well, is that we think these deals are going to be a big success, and it's really not just the expense synergies, which we are going to go get. But if it's a big success, it means that we were successful in cross-selling more to the customers who haven't had the benefit of our broader products and services and then just gain market share. And I think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that, both on the commercial side and the consumer side. And really none of that is \u2013 has been put into our forward forecast at this point. So, goal would be like within 3 years to 5 years, if New York starts to take on a look and feel of what we built in Boston and what we built in Philadelphia, is going to be a home run for us. The other wildcard, obviously, Ken, is what is the kind of long-term or the medium-term macro forecast look like and can the Fed engineer a soft landing. Is there a higher possibility of recession, which could change that dynamic somewhat. But I think, certainly, right now, with respect to 2022, we feel really good about how we are positioned from a credit standpoint. I would \u2013 if you ask me to make a call, I would say it's unlikely we will have a recession in \u201822. So, at least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while. Whether we can still show net benefits on the provision line, I think those days are probably numbered. But in any case, I think there is still going to be good numbers. And as John said, the ACL may tick down a little more from here, but kind of starting to feel like we are not going to go a huge amount lower. Let me just say a word and then Don really has the best color. But clearly, it's nice to see the line utilization pick up. Some of it is a little defensive in nature. So, people have been worried about their supply chain and inventory levels. And so when they can get a hold of the materials that they need to go out and buy it. So, I would say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver and a little of that also is inflation, which is causing those materials to cost more. So, that would be, I would say, number one. There is still \u2013 people doing deals, doing smaller deals and playing offense in terms of growth. There is a little bit of that kicking in as well. I think what continues to give us confidence is the thing that Don mentioned earlier that there is private capital has amassed tons of firepower to put to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done. And so there is still deal-related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth. But with that, let me turn it over to Don. The one last thing you might also add Don is on subscription line financing some of the securitization... I would just add to that, John, is all the early warning signs are flash and green, which is great. So, on the consumer side, delinquency roll rates, some of the things Brendan quoted, all appear really, really good. Similarly, on the commercial side, the crit/class ratio continues to go down and the heightened. There is very few credits that are in heightened monitoring. So, that also bodes well for the future. You can \u2013 at these very low levels for things like charge-offs and NPAs you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit. But overall, we feel really, really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year. Good morning. Yes. I don't see us looking at a depository there anytime soon. I think we have got enough on our plate that getting off to this really great start and launching New York Metro is job one. We do have a strategy in Florida that I think is interesting. So, we had a couple of de novo wealth centers, one in Palm Beach and one in Naples that we focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can really make some traction in those markets. And then we had five or six come over from HSBC, very attractive locations and branches with good staffing in the Miami area. And so again, that's job one is to try to really make that work, what we have and really drive up the performance of those sites and keep getting smart in the market and keep talking to people, keep trying to figure out kind of where with the next city where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share. So, that's to me, the focus, and we will keep trying to get smart on the market, but let's suggest what we have and make that productive. The other point I would make with respect to Florida and elsewhere where we are kind of outside of our core footprint is we are investing heavily in the digital bank. And very recently, we have migrated to a new cloud-based core platform, which is really exciting for us, it's going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate those offerings on the digital platform. And so that's kind of also twinned with some light branches in markets like Florida, can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms. And then over time, we will figure out what physical presence do we need to complement those digital offerings. So, it's pretty exciting. We have a similar opportunity in the Greater Washington area, where we picked up, I think it's nine or ten branches from HSBC. So, we can try to attack that market through digital and decide is nine or ten the right number, are they in the right locations, do we need to alter that and then using test and learning from Florida and from DC. Are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing digital presence combined with some thin branch presence. Yes. I will go ahead and start a couple of thoughts there. I mean I think that as you heard from Brendan earlier, and you saw on our Slide 7, our CD portfolio is much smaller than it was before. And what that \u2013 at the start, and I think what the point there is that CDs could be part of the story. And we would do it in a way that's connected to a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach, which is I think how things got played out early in the last cycle for us, whereas this cycle is all going to be about customer relationships. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle, we expect CD betas to be lower during the cycle and part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go. The last cycle took a longer time, 2 years to 3 years. And so you kept getting that ratcheted up cost of CDs every time they came to maturity. So, I do think CDs can be part of the story given deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle, CDs can absolutely be something a tool that will utilize coming off a lower base. So, that's the first point. And the second point is that on the commercial side, you will have balanced migration, that's natural as compensating balances that don't need to be quite as high to get as earnings credit rates actually rise over time. So yes, there will be some of that migration that's built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into our deposit costs overall. And so \u2013 but it's the same point there that given the number of ways that we can interact with our customers on the commercial side, we are deepening our relationships there and expect that those migrations will be well controlled and as expected. Okay. Alright. I think that's it for the questions in the queue. And let me just close by thanking everybody again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "I'm happy to give \u2013 Erika, you had asked about sort of the counts of checking account customers. Just kind of a couple of quick points, when you look at total relationships in the consumer bank, when we went public, we had about 2.9 million to 3 million customers. We now have over 7 million customers in total. Now some of those are loan customers. So when you unpack that to core deposit customers, that number is sort of we went from 2.9 million to 3.5 million customers. So that's good growth, but that's really not where the action is in the story versus sort of heading down this path really under the covers on that growth, which we've been in sort of top quartile growth of our peers has been a quality transformation. So there is been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank. And more than 100% of the growth in the household base has come from mass affluent and affluent customers. So when you combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships, that's what's driving a lot of the improvement in DDA and non-interest-bearing deposits, which is very sustainable. That's kind of ground game a lot of work over multiple quarters over a lot of years to get that to scale. And look, we still have some running room. I think there is still oxygen left in tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base. We've made a lot of progress in catching up to peers, but we still have momentum. It does not seem to be slowing. I think you should expect more and more of that putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus deposits under the coverage, the quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale. The other point I'd make mention obviously you think about betas for this up cycle last time because of the low DDA balances that we had in consumer, we had about $10 billion in CDs. Now we start that period with only $3 billion. And so \u2013 when we look a lot more like a bigger sized bank in terms of deposit composition than we do smaller-sized bank where we're not as rate sensitive in how we're driving deposits because of that quality transformation that you see in the customer base. Yes. Look, I think we've demonstrated in a variety of cycles, the ability to deposits at scale. The question is always at what cost? And I think we're in a dramatically different position in up cycle than we were certainly in the last up cycle, we continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side, starting with just the breadth of the levers that we've built, whether it's the Citizens Access platform nationally to raise deposits away from our core book the new markets that we're entering, where we've got a solid and stable deposit base, but we think there is a lot of up running room. And in fact, we're starting to see signs already. We've got $100 million in inflow of balanced sales already in the New York market from great execution and solid sales. So we're optimistic continuing to go forward, that can continue. And as we bring convert the customer base from investors closely they want into the platform, we think that same opportunity will exist in New Jersey. And then our analytics have improved materially over the last couple of years, which allows us to be even more targeted. And when you marry that with what I said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our customer base, the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market rates than needing to reach for promo rates. So I feel really good that we will be able to grow at the pace we need with a much more moderate cost. Well, you can count on us continuing to be disciplined yet competitive. Yes. There is a handful of things on the consumer side. So on other retail, there is a good percentage of that book that's variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such. And you're going to see that kind of ramp up as the market changes. On the resi side, we're obviously a very big lender in HELOC, which is essentially all variable. And we've had four sequential quarters in a row and net balance sheet growth and I believe we're the number one originator in all of the United States and HELOC. So really striking well the iron is hot and taking advantage of that business. So you're seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there as the rates kind of March north. On the mortgage side, there is a couple of things. One is front book pricing. We've been disciplined on front book pricing to the point of being a lot on the market at times as the market lags capacity, but we're going to make sure we're using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the market. The other just technical dynamic that you're seeing, if you're looking at linked quarter on mortgages in Q4, we did have a one-time reserve adjustment to the yields in Q4 that is non-recurring and didn't happen in Q1. So if you look back a couple of quarters, you'll see a little bit of noise on what you saw in Q4, but that's kind of gone. That's sort of washed out, so we should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that book that is in variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing. Yes. The same comments on the consumer side, our product set is significantly more diversified than both HSBC and investors, which is great. And we didn't build those revenue synergies into the deal model. So, we are seeing early signs of significant sales opportunity in New York. We are delivering on that. We are starting marketing middle of the year. We are going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for investors inside of 2022, and then the rest of the platform will convert in 2023. So, it will take some time, but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue growth over time. Yes, it's Brendan. I can take that. On the mortgage side, this is fully expected. These are sort of an administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time. We have done extensive analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance on to a full repayment schedule and its de minimis. Especially on the mortgage side, we have got very significant coverage on our loan to value. And so we feel really confident in that. Just broadly on the consumer book, we haven't seen much of any early signs that we are starting to see a tick up in return to normal. We are expecting one, but the delinquency levels generally remain in very strong spot and significantly depressed. Some of the newer portfolios that we have talked a lot about over the years on these calls and others around student loans and merchant point-of-sale maintain incredible strength and have not shown any signs of uptick in early delinquencies whatsoever. So, we feel really confident around the outlook, the state of credit and consumers that the lowest levels it's ever been, and we continue to sort of beat to the positive almost every month on what we are seeing on NTO. So, I feel really good. And I think \u2013 and when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer, they are still showing a lot of excess liquidity, the money in consumer checking accounts is still at all-time highs, really hasn't moved down. While we are seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things, it's not adding to outstanding. So, in order to believe that you will start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line, I think you would have to see some deflation on the excess cash built up in the consumers' wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables building up in the credit card. So, we haven't seen that. So, all the early indicators just aren't moving yet. Of course, we do expect it will, but just right now, it's not. So, we will take it. Yes. Pre legal day one, the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of international customers that we are rotating into banks that have more global capabilities. And so the good news on that is that we didn't pay premium of any kind for those customers that we weren't really going to get at our core. We had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition post legal day one than you would normally expect in a deal like that, given the profile of the customers that were banking at HSBC. The good news is since legal day one, it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated pre-legal day one, and we have seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level with good sales, very strong sales and normal expected is in outflows on the back book. And so we do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we ramp up our marketing activities, which would obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side offsetting some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one. So, we feel really, really good on the early signs that we are seeing here we are six weeks or seven weeks in."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Keeley, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Keeley. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation, and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was an incredible year in many respects. With the Fed's aggressive moves to subdue inflation, the West Coast bank failures, a surprisingly resilient economy, and several significant proposals from bank regulators, it was important in navigating this dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense while continuing to play disciplined offense and take advantage of opportunities in the market. Defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management, and I feel really good about how we ended the year. Our capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, CET1 adjusted for AOCI of roughly 9% and a tangible common equity ratio of 6.7%. Our liquidity position is at an all-time best with a loan to deposit ratio of 82%, pro forma Category 1 LCR of 117% and 156% liquidity coverage of our uninsured deposits. Our ACL ratio is at 159% compared to 130% pro forma day 1 CECL, and general office reserves are at 10.2%. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships which deliver stronger relative returns. We are using a non-core strategy to run off loans and free capital for better opportunities. On offense, we have several important initiatives we are driving, such as the private bank buildout, the New York City Metro initiative, our focus on serving private capital and growing our payments business. These are all tracking well. In particular, we are pleased to see the private bank team reach $1.2 billion in deposits soon after our launch in late October. Our financials over the course of the year came under some pressure, primarily given higher funding costs. Nonetheless, we delivered a 13.5% underlying ROTCE for the full year, with a 95% return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see smaller sequential declines in NII than in the prior quarter as the Fed last hiked in July and the pressure on funding costs has lessened. We saw a modest bounce back in fees, but are very encouraged by the tone of the markets in 2024 to date. Hopefully, we start to see our big capital markets pipelines begin to deliver. We took some meaningful cost actions in Q4 to set the stage for a very modest expense growth in 2024. We only had the private bank for two quarters, so if you normalize for that, we're actually reducing the legacy expense base by 1.4%. I should reinforce though that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives. Credit outlook continues to track expectations. CRE general office is being carefully managed. Losses are being absorbed in net charge offs. It's relatively predictable with few surprises so far. Away from that, credit quality is strong. In Q4 we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio which is a promising sign. On the capital front, we did not buy in any stock in Q4, given the charges related to the FDIC special surcharge as well as associated with our cost initiatives. We expect to be back in the market in Q1, and for that to continue through 2024. Turning to our outlook, we expect NII to continue with modest declines through midyear and then start to tick up. The exciting news on NIM/NII is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and noncore runoff over \u201825 to \u201827, which will power higher EPS and returns. We are poised for strong fee growth led by capital markets. Net charge offs will rise modestly, but we are likely to see ACL releases over the course of the year. Our key priorities for 2024 will be to continue to operate with a strong defense/prudent offense mindset. We have many exciting things on our technology, our digital, data analytics and AI roadmap that we need to deliver on. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We feel we are well positioned for medium-term outperformance. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering in great effort in 2023. We know we can count on you again in the new year. With that, let me turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with some commentary on 2023. We demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength while delivering solid financial performance. We were resilient through a turbulent environment, benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels and strong liquidity based on stable consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources. This strength allowed us to execute well against our multi-year strategic initiatives while opportunistically building out the private bank. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS at $3.88, which included a $0.51 drag from non-core, and an $0.11 investment in the private bank. Full year ROTCE was 13.5% after incorporating these items. Before I discuss the details of the fourth quarter results, here are some highlights referencing slides 4, 5, and 7. On the slides you can see we generated underlying net income of $426 million for the fourth quarter and EPS of $0.85. This includes $0.06 for our continued investment in the startup of the private bank and a $0.15 negative impact from the non-core portfolio. We had a significant increase in the impacts from notable items this quarter included on Slide 4. The largest driver was the FDIC special assessment, followed by elevated top and severance related expenses attributable to meaningful headcount reduction. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 11.8%. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTCE of 14.8%. Currently, the private bank startup investment is dilutive to results, but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive. The private bank is off to a very good start, raising about $1.2 billion of deposits through the end of the year, of which more than 30% are non-interest bearing. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it continues to run off, further bolstering our overall performance going forward. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.59%, up from 1.55% in third quarter. This includes a robust 10.2% coverage for general office, up from 9.5% in the prior quarter. We continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter, achieving our planned liquidity profile. Our pro forma Category 1 bank LCR rose to 117% from 109% in the prior quarter. We also reduced our period end flood borrowings by $3.3 billion quarter-over-quarter to $3.8 billion, and our period-end LDR improved linked quarter to 82% from 84%. Regarding strategic initiatives, as previously mentioned, the private bank is off to a great start and TOP continues to contribute. In addition, New York Metro is tracking well, and we are poised to capitalize on the growing private capital opportunity. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail, turning to Slide 8 and starting with net interest income. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, partially offset by a 2% increase in average interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff were more than offset by higher funding costs and swaps, the net impact of which reduced NIM by 3 basis points to the 3% level. The additional 9 basis point decline to 2.91% was due to the impact of our liquidity build which was neutral to NII. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased a modest 3 basis points to 51%, as the Fed has paused and we see continued but slowing deposit migration. We expect this moderating trend to continue until the Fed eventually cuts rates. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally in the pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Moving to Slide 9. Fees were up 2% linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record performance from wealth. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. The improvement in capital markets reflects increased activity with the decline in long rates in November driving a nice pickup in bond underwriting. Equities improved with strength in the back half of the quarter as the environment became more favorable. M&A advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the better macro and rates outlook, although several transactions pushed to Q1. We see capital markets momentum picking up in Q1 as markets are positive and our deal pipelines are strong. The wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in AUM growth. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees as high mortgage rates continued to weigh on lot volumes. The servicing operating P&L improved modestly while the MSR valuation, net of hedging, was lower. On Slide 10, we did well on expenses which were down slightly linked quarter even while including the impact of the continued private bank startup investment. Our reported expense of $1.61 billion increased $319 million, including notable items totaling $323 million, namely the industrywide FDIC special assessment of $225 million, and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into 2024. I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. On Slide 11, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 3% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans which were partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Average commercial [line] (ph) utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next on slides 12 and 13, we continued to do well on deposits. Period end deposits were broadly stable linked quarter with an increase in consumer driven by the private bank offset by lower commercial. The decline in commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits, running off approximately $3.5 billion of higher cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter. Absent this BSO effect, deposits would have been up by about 1.5% this quarter. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are up 19 basis points, which translates to 51% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 71% insured or secure. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories with noninterest bearing now representing about 21% of total deposits. This is slightly below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here, although this will be dependent on the path of rates and customer behavior. Moving on to credit on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter. We were pleased to see that commercial charge offs were stable linked quarter, and we also saw a modest decline in criticized loans, as we continued to work through the general office portfolio. We saw continued normalization of charge offs in the retail portfolio along with seasonal impacts. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 15. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.59%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the denominator effect from lower portfolio balances. We increased the reserve for the $3.6 billion general office portfolio to $370 million which represents a coverage of 10.2%, up from 9.5% in the third quarter, as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers. We have already taken $148 million in charge-offs on this portfolio, which is about 4% of loans. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be about 9%. Also, our tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.7% at the end of the year. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers, and you can see on Slide 36 in the appendix where we stand currently relative to peers in the third quarter. We returned a total of $198 million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter. We paused our share repurchases in the fourth quarter in light of the FDIC special assessment. Having exceeded our target capital level for year end, we expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we plan to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size. On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program. First, on Slide 17, the buildout of the private bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum. Following our formal launch in the fourth quarter, our bankers have raised more than $1.2 billion of attractive deposits, with roughly 75% of that from commercial clients. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California. We have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities, with our Clarfeld Wealth Management Business as the centerpiece of that effort. Moving to Slide 18, you are all well aware of our efforts in New York Metro. That's going really well, and we are hitting our targets there. And on the commercial side, as I mentioned before, we are starting to see momentum building in capital markets. This should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital backing private equity gets put to work. Next on Slide 19, we continue to be disciplined on expenses. It's important to remember that a key to Citizens\u2019 success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 8 program, achieving a pretax run rate benefit of about $115 million at the end of 2023. And we've launched TOP 9 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $135 million of pretax benefits by the end of 2024. The new TOP program is focused on efficiency opportunities from further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization and save more on third party spend as well. Last year, we exited the auto business, and we also exited the wholesale mortgage business in the fourth quarter. We are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our headcount by about 650, or approximately 3.5%, and we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and are rationalizing some of our corporate and back-office facilities. Given all this work, we are targeting to limit our underlying expense growth in 2024 to roughly 1% to 1.5%, with a net decrease in legacy Citizens expenses of 1.3% to 1.5%, being offset by investments in the private bank. Playing prudent defense is at the top of our priority list given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that began back in March and the uncertain macro outlook. So, we are reworking both sides of the balance sheet through our balance sheet optimization efforts. Slide 20 provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan portfolio through our non-core strategy and optimization on the commercial side with a focus on relationship based lending and attractive risk adjusted returns. On the left side of the page, you'll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining $11 billion non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $6.4 billion from where we were at the end of the year to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025. And as this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction in wholesale funding, with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio. The capital recaptured through reduction in non-core RWA will be primarily reallocated to support attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the private bank. In the broader consumer portfolio, we are targeting growth in the home equity, card and mortgage, which offer the greatest relationship potential. Moving to the right side of the page, we are also working on the commercial portfolio, exiting lower return credit only relationships and focusing on selective C&I lending with multi-product relationship opportunities. We are leading more deals in our front book, improving spreads while also improving the overall return profile of the book. In the appendix, we have included more information covering the broad contours of our BSO program, including how we are managing our high-quality deposit book, remixing our wholesale funding, managing our securities portfolio and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment. Moving to Slide 21, I will take you through our full year 2024 outlook, which contemplates the early January forward curve and a Fed Funds rate of 4.25% by the end of the year. We expect NII to be down 6% to 9%, with changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline, and average loans down roughly 2% to 3%. However, we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 5%, with private bank growing over the course of the year and commercial activity picking up in the second half. On the deposit side, we expect spot growth of 1.2% -- I'm sorry, 1% to 2% and well controlled deposit costs with a terminal beta in the low 50s, before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in May. We expect our net interest margin to trough around the middle of the year and average in the 2.8% to 2.85% range for the full year, and we expect to exit the year around 2.85%. We've included Slide 23, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. In 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 38, which demonstrates how the 2024 headwind, which is incorporated in our 2024 NII guide, reverses to a substantial NII tailwind in 2025 and beyond, as the current forward curve is realized. For example, there is an expected improvement in NII contribution from swaps in 2025 year-over-year of approximately $371 million with continued meaningful benefits in 2026 and 2027. Non-interest income is expected to be up in the 6% to 9% range depending upon market environment, led by a nice rebound in capital markets. We expect expenses to be up about 1% to 1.5%. Excluding the private bank, this would be down 1.3% to 1.5%. We have provided a walk showing the components of our 2024 expense outlook on Slide 22 to provide more context. NCOs are expected to average about 50 basis points for the year as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail. Given macro trends, our remixing of the balance sheet through commercial BSO and the non-core strategy and expectations for modest portfolio growth, we will likely see ACR releases over the course of the year. We plan to resume share repurchases in the first quarter in the $300 million range with more over the course of the year depending upon market conditions and loan growth. Taking that into account, we still expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio of about 10.5%, which is at the upper end of our target range. Putting it all together, we expect to return to sequential positive operating leverage in the second half of the year with PPNR troughing in the second quarter 2024. Moving to slides 24 and 25, as Bruce mentioned, we are well positioned to deliver attractive returns. As we look out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieve a 16% to 18% ROTCE. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business with a substantial NII tailwind given swap portfolio runoff. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage with strong expense discipline and we are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully given the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past few years. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the private bank as it matures and a tailwind from the runoff of the non-core portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity. We will continue to operate with a prudent risk appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over the medium term, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain within a target range of 10% to 10.5%, about 50 basis points higher than our prior target range, given continued uncertainty in the macro environment. On Slide 26, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to lower day count impact on revenue as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. To wrap up, we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in 2023 as we worked to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term. We delivered solid results this quarter and we ended the year with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position that puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise. We are continuing to optimize the balance sheet and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Keeley, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nPeter Winter: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nPeter Winter: Can you guys provide some color on the drivers to that spot loan growth, including some details about the contribution from the private bank and what you're thinking in terms of commercial line utilization?\nJohn Woods: Yeah, I'll just start off and others can add. But I mean I think those are the two drivers, as you mentioned. When we look out into primarily the second half of 2024, we are seeing an expectation that commercial activity will pick up. Loan utilization is flattening out here, we expect early in the year. And then so that'll be part of the driver. We also have had some BSO activity in late \u201823 and early \u201824 that we expect to moderate in the second half of the year as well. So you're going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side. And then on the consumer side of things, we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the mortgage space and in HELOC, which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us. But those are the main drivers. Then, of course, broadly, the private bank, which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side of things in late \u201823, we're going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in \u201824. So those are the big, I would say, components of seeing that spot loan growth.\nBruce Van Saun: Maybe, Brendan, you could talk a little bit about what you expect for private bank lending.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah, sure. Well, I would start by -- just a quick comment on Q4 for the private bank. Obviously, strong deposit print and I think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified and led by wealth and deposits and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationship. So we're really excited about the print and the start by the team. Having said that, we do expect lending to pick up steam in 2024. Given the interest rate environment, mortgages are obviously challenged on the retail side. So the lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending, which has skewed in the private equity and venture space, which we're really comfortable with the risk appetite and the profile of that business. And it's been critical to start to dislodge personal private banking relationships from the ecosystem of private equity and venture. So we're off to a really good start. I suspect, given the forward curves, that the first half of the year will continue to be led by commercial principally and private equity and venture lending. Over time, we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending, home equity lending, mortgage lending coming in at scale as the rate environment dictates opportunities there. We also expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity venture with private banking and personal banking. So you'll start to see an asset diversification over time, but the first half of the year, we would expect it to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Great. Don, anything to add on the commercial side?\nDon McCree: Yeah. I think if you look back at the fourth quarter, the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were it's about 50% utilization, 50% BSO with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there. So people that were carrying slightly higher balances on the commercial side, a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed off in the last six weeks of the year. And that's continued into this year. So I think the particular area that we're excited about as we get into the back end of 2024 is the private equity space. I mean, that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years. There's lots of conversations going on. We're hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active and that'll drive utilization on our capital call lines, which is at an all-time low right now. So, I think that's what the real driver is.\nBruce Van Saun: Great. Peter, did you have another question?\nPeter Winter: Yes, just a quick follow-up. That's helpful. But on just the fee income, you talked about up to 6% to 9%. You did mention, the pipeline is strong for the capital markets, but just if you could give some color on the puts and takes on the fee income side.\nBruce Van Saun: John?\nJohn Woods: Yeah, just kind of the main drivers of that. It's basically a continuation of some of the trends we're seeing in the fourth quarter of 2023, where capital markets is starting to pick up again, pipelines are incredibly strong. And I think that the lead driver seems to be M&A advisory. That's picked up in 4Q, not only due to seasonal factors, but just in terms of a more constructive backdrop. We're also seeing, as you get in -- out into \u201824, pick up and underwriting, both on the bond side and on the equity side, and so -- and solid contributions from global markets as well. But -- so those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in Q4, continuing in Q1 with excellent pipelines and playing out over the rest of \u201824.\nBruce Van Saun: You might add something on wealth, Brendan. I don't know if you want to. We expect continued really strong growth on wealth fees.\nBrendan Coughlin: We do, and we spent a year of slow and steady progression continuing to get all-time highs in the wealth management business. But given the private bank investment, 2024 is going to be a really important year. We're out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent. We've made a number of key hires in Q4, both on the leadership side as well as at the advisor side. And so getting the ecosystem of the bankers that we hired in the summer, connected with top and market wealth managers is critical for us. We're rebranding the platform to Citizen private wealth management to connect the private banking and wealth side together hand in glove. And so we do expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time really connected into the private banking ecosystem. So we're pleased with the momentum, but there's a lot more to come and we hope if we execute well on the private banking initiative.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay, very good.\nPeter Winter: And just on mortgage banking.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah, so John hit some highlights on Q4 for mortgage. Production was down a bit. Our underlying servicing business was up modestly. And then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in Q3, Q4. I think as we look the outlook going forward, we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage business. If you rewind the clock back to prior to the Franklin American acquisition, we were under scale in mortgage and really were trying to diversify the business. We've done that really successfully in hindsight. It was an incredibly well-timed acquisition and we performed exceptionally well through the COVID years. And as we exit that period of time and look forward, our MSR concentration versus peers is really strong. It's a little bit on the high side. We looked at our business model and said, wholesale mortgage, we're one of the only lenders in there. The margins were really challenged and the outlook for rates don't necessarily suggest a [boom lift] (ph) of refi activity in the medium term. And so wholesale mortgage being a non-relationship business, we decided that it was time to move on and we're committed to correspond it. We're really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending. But despite rates coming down, we do expect the mortgage market to be, call it, a $2 trillion originations platform in 2024, which is about a normalized mortgage market. So we should see some modest uptick in originations. And with rates coming back down, the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure. So I think we feel like we're in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance with where we're at Q4, within a range of normal volatility. And we're going to make sure that we're executing on driving up returns higher and making sure allocating balance sheets to deep relationship based customers, whether it's in the private bank or in the core retail business, to continue to offer that product to our very best customers.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, just to wrap it all that up, in \u201824 we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins. So that's another tailwind if we get into next year in terms of the production business.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question.\nPeter Winter: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you guys elaborate a bit on the expense cuts that you did this quarter in terms of where they're coming from? And obviously you're leaning in on the private bank, but kind of ex that, have you made sure you're not cutting too much during these initiatives and the ones that you've had in prior years?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. I'll start off here. But I think we have been very, very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies. There's always the playbook where if you kind of eliminate your bottom X percent of performers and redistribute some of the work that you can run a little leaner. And so we've gone through that exercise to make sure that we won't be caught short in any areas. We carved out important areas like risk and audit and some of the control areas so they were spared kind of from taking reductions. And then we also carved out the areas that are important investment activities. And so, the rollup of all that, Matt, comes to a relatively modest number, 3.5% of total staff count. But I think we're kind of lean and mean and in good fighting shape as we enter into 2024.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, the deposit growth that you've had from the private bank, have you disclosed what that rate is? I think a third of them are not expiring, but what's the blended rate? And I guess are you using promotions, whether it's rate or other stuff to help grow those? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, we haven't really talked about that, but I mean, I think what we should look at is that this is accretive to the low-cost profile top of the house. When you look at DDA and operating accounts, it's extremely attractive mix that we've seen come in early days. So we're extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a very sort of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side of -- on the other side of the balance sheet. So, yeah, I would say the mix is quite good and overall cost, very attractive and accretive to top of house.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would -- there's a Slide 11, Matt, that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits, but DDA and then checking with interest, which are very low costs, roughly 40%, very little term, and most of that in kind of liquid savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what we're offering to the core franchise.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi.\nJohn Pancari: Just a couple questions on the credit front. Charge-offs came in at around 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. You expect an average of about 50 basis points overall in 2024. Can you maybe talk to us about where you expect losses to peak and to hit that 50 bps for the full year and what gives you confidence that they can remain there? And then similarly, on the reserve front, I know you added to reserves in the fourth quarter, but you implied you could see releases in 2024. What do you need to see to drive the releases? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. So I'll start and then John can then give some more color. So I think that the kind of push that we've seen higher over the course of \u201923, that could continue a little bit higher into \u201824. So going from 46, say, to 50 is kind of twofold for the most part. One is that CRE general office is, we're watching the maturity wall and we're on top of all these credits very carefully and we're working them out. And as I said in my opening remarks, a lot of this is fairly predictable. So kind of we can look ahead six months, nine months, we can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take charge-offs. And so I think we have good visibility into that. It's a long process on CRE General Office. I think we'll have this with us all through \u201824 and likely into \u201825 as well. But again, the important thing is, I think we're well-reserved for it, and it's baked into that charge-off run rate. The second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side, which has been extremely slow and gradual, but we're still slightly better than where we were pre-COVID. And so that will just gently push up as we go forward. And so that would be the other driver. I'd say the good news is that in C&I, we're not really seeing any kind of hotspots and so we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad C&I through 2024. On the question of the ACL is, this year we've been consistently building each quarter. And if you get to the scenario where there's likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession, we've put away enough reserves that I think we will be able to start to draw that down. And so time will tell on that, but you can already see that we've been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve bill from absolute provision over charge-offs in this quarter. It was flat. It was $171 million over $171 million. And so even if charge-offs can pick up a little bit, I think it's likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed charge-offs reduce as we go through the year. I don't know, John, if you want to add any color to that.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, just a little bit. I think that all makes sense. And I'd say that the drivers of where you want to be with your reserve is, we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon which is a mile to moderate adverse outcome. So that's built in We think that we're seeing stabilization in terms of the performance of the back book in our loan book. So we see visibility into the charge-off outlook. And then the build, which could be the other driver of ACL when you're building loans, what we're rotating away from and building into, there's actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high quality origination front book in the private bank and commercial that we're putting on the portfolio in \u201824 while other stuff, maybe a higher ACL load is running off in the back book. So those are the things I would just add to what Bruce said.\nJohn Pancari: Great. All right. Thank you for that. And then separately, on the capital front, you indicated that you expect to resume buybacks in the first quarter of \u201824. And maybe if you could help us possibly quantify the pace of buybacks that's fair to assume. Could you be back at that $200 million quarterly rate or how should we think about that? Thanks.\nBruce Van Saun: Well, at this point, we've given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about $300 million. So we probably, with benefit of 2020 hindsight, could have bought some in the fourth quarter, but water under the bridge for [10/6] (ph). So we have a little above-target capital to kind of play with, if you will, in the first quarter. And then in the first half of the year, we're not going to have much net loan growth. Non-core is going to be running down, and we don't really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the private banking commercial, as John indicated. So I think the buybacks would tend to be more first half oriented, but a lot can happen over the course of the year. And so I kind of defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate just to say we'll have a solid print in the first quarter and likely more in a second quarter and then we'll see how the year plays out.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, and I just would reiterate our capital priorities are a strong dividend, and if we have opportunities to put capital to work, serving clients and driving great really strong risk-adjusted returns. That's our preference. And when that moderates a bit, that's when you see us give it back in the form of buybacks. And so we're in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity to trade.\nBruce Van Saun: And one last add-on point to your add-on point is I would say I'm really happy to be buying my stock at these levels because we think it's great value.\nJohn Woods: That's it.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next to the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Hey, good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nEbrahim Poonawala: I guess maybe one question for you, Bruce, as you think about capital deployment, you've been pretty busy last year in terms of the strategic actions. Just wondering, where do you see, like, as you look at investment opportunities for the franchise, are you done for now in terms of putting the big pieces in place, or how are you thinking about new things and new investments that we could see either on an organic basis, team lift-outs, or just outright M&A?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, good question. I would say the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives. So we've mentioned the private bank and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big success. And we've been investing in the New York marketplace and certainly to get your brand awareness up is expensive proposition, but we're doing that and that is showing very good results. There are certain businesses like payments that are, I think, going through a lot of change and that change always presents opportunities. And so making sure that we're investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain share and grow that business, those are the things that kind of come top of mind that we're very focused on. I think in terms of acquisitions and our fee-based capabilities, we've made significant investments over time in commercial. And so our M&A size and scale is at quite a good level. So we could be selective there. Don't see anything imminent, but there's possibilities that if there's an industry vertical that makes sense, maybe we could do something there. And then wealth, we've been looking at trying to buy some things. We bought Clarfeld, which turned out to be a fantastic acquisition, but I think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the lift-out route and to bring teams onto the platform. And so we're hard at work on that to try to scale up Citizens' private wealth. So I would say the franchise is in good shape. There's a lot of initiatives in place that will, I think, have us outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers. So I think we can sit back and be selective in terms of deploying capital inorganically.\nEbrahim Poonawala: That is helpful. And I guess just one follow-up in terms of -- for whatever reason, when you look at your NII, the fee revenue guide in particular, just maybe talk to us around expense flex. If some of these things don't play out as expected, should we anticipate some level of, like, expense offset or are you kind of pretty tight given just everything you've done on the cost side?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, I mean there's always opportunities to look to flex your expense base down. I think we've been pretty hard at it here to get to this level. And I'd say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility, but again, if you're looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with $0.03 to $0.05 or something of that magnitude, if that puts at jeopardy your trajectory on things like private bank, it wouldn't appear to be a really advisable decision to take. So we will always look at that. You know you can trust us to do that. But at this point, we're trying to manage for both near-term delivery but also with an eye towards the medium term and really getting that ROTCE back into the kind of targeted range.\nEbrahim Poonawala: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nScott Siefers: John, I think you've got five great cuts built into the guidance. Just maybe a broad thought on sort of where that balance sheet is geared now. In other words, I guess more specifically, how would more or fewer cuts impact the NII outlook?\nJohn Woods: Yeah, I mean, I would say that we're very close to neutral one way or the other, really up or down. And -- but I'd say that I think what's important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter. And it continued this quarter. We expect it to continue next quarter. But, our outlook is until you get that first cut, it still doesn't completely go away. So we have an expectation the first cut comes in the second quarter and we get down to around 4.25%. I think that's still holding around. We're looking out the window today in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate. I would say that if there's a slight bias, if the cuts came in a little fewer this year, that would probably be okay. But nevertheless, that first cut is key. And a general normalization in an orderly fashion over time is what we think is very good for our balance sheet. Again, staying around neutral with maybe a slight benefit if rates come in a tiny bit higher in \u201824.\nBruce Van Saun: The other aspect to that too is just we've had an inverted curve for a long time. So, when you think about the medium term, presumably we get back to a point where there's a normal yield curve, which also benefits NII.\nJohn Woods: Yeah.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you. And then also, John, for you, so the liquidity building efforts have introduced some noise into the margin rate, even if they've been NII-neutral, I guess, just looking at the guidance, presumably that's going to be less of a factor going forward, but just maybe a thought on sort of where we are in that journey.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, I\u2019d say we're basically -- we've achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity bill. This is the headline there. And it\u2019s -- we believe a very strong kind of position being around 117% of the requirements for Category 1 banks. I think that matches our objectives and therefore going forward you will not see liquidity being a headwind to net interest.\nBruce Van Saun: I think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year. It affected us in Q3. It affected us in Q4. If you actually look at, I think, one of the dialogues on these calls a way back, are we going to exit the year close to 3% underlying? Well, we actually did do that. The underlying performance on our NIM was quite good. It only dropped 3 basis points, which is showing up well relative to everybody who's reported so far. But that liquidity build, which is neutral to NII, took us down another 9. So we end up exiting closer to [290 than to the 3] (ph). But that liquidity build is kind of done. And so we can just focus on not having that, exercising that from the conversation and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up. You mentioned the PPNR bottoming in the second quarter. I'm just wondering, do you expect NII to bottom coincident with that, or would there be a slight timing disconnect based on how the swaps work through?\nJohn Woods: Yeah, I mean, I think that is the driver. Basically, that we are looking at NII being at 70% of our revenues. So yeah, the NII's going to bottom in that quarter as well.\nBruce Van Saun: But in Q3, Ken, then you'd have other things kicking in, like fee growth strong, long growth starting to kick in. And so even though the swap is incremental, forward starting swaps, then I think we'd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would allow us to absorb that.\nJohn Woods: Yeah [indiscernible] later. But PPNR troughs in 2Q.\nKen Usdin: Well, I'm sorry, John. Can you just clarify that again? I didn't want to speak over it.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. And I think we're mentioning that the NIM trough is 3Q, but the PPNR NII trough is in 2Q.\nKen Usdin: Okay, got it. And then just looking out at the longer term guidance you gave just talking about the 3.25%, 3.40% medium term NIM range, it seems like that most of that can be gotten from the three buckets that you show, just getting curing from the fourth quarter level. And I see that you put in a 3.25% end of \u201825 Fed Funds rate. So I'm just wondering how you expect deposit costs and just beta to traject, and I know there's a lot of moving parts in there too because of the growth that you're expecting as well, and mix changes, but just can you maybe just start by just talking about if you're getting to the low 50s on the way up, just how that expects to act and influences that medium-term NIM range? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, it's a big driver. I mean, I think the big puts and takes there. I mean, you've got the swap portfolio, which is a big tailwind as we've talked about. But if you go over to the deposit side of things, we are looking at deposit migration stabilizing around mid \u201824 after that first cut in May. You see deposit migration stabilizing. And then as cuts continue, we start flipping to down beta type of expectations versus the up beta. And we look at the early 2000s as being instructive for a lot of this, where that tightening -- that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would imply a 35% to 40% down beta for the first call it 100 to 150 basis points. And so that's a good, I think, yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle, our down beta will be less than the full up beta, so our full up beta is low 50s, but nevertheless we're going to get big contributions from down beta and that will grow over time getting close to where the up beta ended up.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Putting all your answers together, John and Bruce, about the outlook for 2024 and the underlying dynamics of net interest income, it seems to me that if we put together what you just said to Ken about deposit betas in Slide 23, that despite the exit rate of your net interest margin forecasted to be 2.85% in the fourth quarter, based on everything that you've told us, it seems like you'll see a three handle in terms of that underlying NIM that Bruce discussed in 2025. Is that a good bridge to thinking about where you're exiting in \u201824 and then that medium-term range that you gave us?\nJohn Woods: Well, I would say, well, we're exiting \u201824 at 2.85%. We've indicated that's where fourth quarter of \u201823 is going to -- no, fourth quarter of \u201824 will be. And so that's headed to the 3.25% to 3.40% range. And so you would see us crossing that 3% level in \u201825 sometime, on the way to 3.25%.\nErika Najarian: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy: Hi, Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Hey, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bruce, you guys have done a great job from when you went public to where you are today in transforming this company. So I'm curious on your medium term outlook for ROTCE, on the improvement you highlight that the private bank you're targeting at 20% to 24% ROTCE. Can you share with us the mix of how you get there, meaning what percentage of revenue do you think you need to reach from fees versus net interest income? And then also what kind of pre-tax margin do you think you'll need to get to that 20% to 24% target?\nJohn Woods: Yeah, maybe I'll just start off with that, Gerard, it's John. I mean, I think, our fees to total revenues are in the neighborhood of 25%. And I'd say over the medium term, you're going to see that migrate closer to 30%. And that would be consistent with a balance sheet optimization efforts where all of the capital we're putting to work on the front book would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and fee-based opportunities associated with it at a much greater rate than what we're seeing running off in the back book. And so that's going to drive that fee percentage up closer to 30%. And I think that the returns that we expect from a, call it, the ROTCE return that you're seeing in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets that's north of 1%. So you see that getting closer to 125 basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side.\nBruce Van Saun: John, you're answering at the comprehensive company on that MTO page. I think, Gerard, is focused more specifically on the private bank mix. But there, I would say, it will build over time, the fee percentage, as we kind of get the wealth cross-sell. But we should at least be at kind of where we are today in 75%-25%, and then I think there's kind of upside from that over time. And I do think the spread on the private bank assets is very significant today, given the high percentage of low-cost deposits in there. We haven't really seen the loans come on in size yet, but generally capital call lines tend to be priced with a nice return. And I think some of the other business lending and HELOCs and things that will maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well. So I think if you looked at kind of mature private banking models to have a 20% to 25% return on equity is realistic. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add to that at all?\nBrendan Coughlin: I think it's well said. I won\u2019t repeat it. I just would reiterate that I think the performance in Q4 is in line with what we would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time. Obviously, more loan growth on the come and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale and recall our targets end of 2025 are $11 billion in deposits, $9 billion in loans, and $10 billion in AUM. So if we deliver that profile, the kind of expense composition, the profitability profile we're seeing so far is aligned with that return. So we're going to work hard to deliver it and hopefully our performance from Q4 sustains in the first half.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And then following up, Bruce, maybe some thoughts from your perspective on what we might see in this Basel III endgame. Obviously, there's a lot of talk about scaling it back and maybe it's going to be a delayed implementation because of all the changes. There's a big focus, as you know, as we all know, on the operating risk in the capital markets businesses. But for the regional banks, it seems like it's more that numerator including the unrealized bond losses than the available for sale portfolio. But any thoughts for Citizens, how you might benefit from a scale back of what was initially proposed and what will be the final proposal?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would say that for banks of our size, the things that we've focused the most on have been RWA increases to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply, the appetite to lend in those areas because it would erode the economics. So things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines attracting capital and small business lending attracting more capital. I think those flaws in the proposal have been well chronicled. And even though they don't result in a meaningful RWA inflation for us, I mean, we're stewards of the US economy and we'd like to see those things adjusted. That's been for kind of banks our size. I think the kind of main thing at top of the list, I think the operational risk kind of increases affect the bigger banks more, but nonetheless they seem to have a fairly big bump on the scale. And so that likely, I think, will have a rethink. And maybe those come down to some extent. That would benefit everybody, but probably the big banks more than banks like ourselves.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, and maybe just add -- just a quick add to that is that even if the Basel III endgame had gone through as initially proposed, a very modest impact from an RWA standpoint on us. And as it relates to AOCI, as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting that likely survives. But in our case, we're at 9% by deducting the AOCI opt-in, and that's an incredibly strong number. So we sort of think about what's going on there is really behind us and really in the run rate, if you will, when it comes to that.\nBruce Van Saun: I think that's a good point that John just raised, Gerard, is that given the strength of our capital position both pre- and post-AOCI, we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts, but really not worry about them. Many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up and getting in position and having to kind of hold back on capital distribution which is really not something that we're worried about given this capital strength. So we're more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catch up, which is a good position to be in.\nGerard Cassidy: Absolutely. In fact, Bruce, you bring up a good point in your guidance on the median term for the total company, legacy, core, ROTCE of 15% to 17% percent. You guys point out significant share repurchases. Should we interpret that to be a combined dividend payout and buyback ratio of 100% percent of earnings, then once we get the final rules and we're all set to go? Is that a fair number to [put] (ph) for you guys because you are well-capitalized?\nBruce Van Saun: That's right, if you go back to the time of the IPO and the number's been over 100% and under 100% and all over the place, but if you just looked at like a 10-year average, almost 10 years, it's about 75%. And so having enough capital to actually grow your business and lend to customers, you have to certainly work that into the equation. But to the extent, as John stated the priorities, dividend is number one, using capital to support organic growth principally in the loan book and then repurchasing shares. I think if we get our returns into that level, we'll be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders both through the dividend and through consistent share repurchases. We should be viewed as a capital return story.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, and I think we had a 95% capital return with performance in \u201823, so it's in that 75% to 100% range over time.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nManan Gosalia: Hi, good morning. Just to follow up to the down beta question on deposits, a few of your peers have talked about how commercial deposit rates are coming down or would come down quickly, but there's likely to be some more pressure on the consumer side continuing from here. They've talked about basically consumers still moving towards high rate accounts. And given that you do have a big core consumer deposit franchise, I was wondering what you're seeing right now and what your expectations are on consumer behavior as rates come down?\nBruce Van Saun: Brendan, you want to take that?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah, sure, I'll take that. Well, let me start big picture and then give you a little color on Q4 and expectations. So we've been talking for years that the investments we've made in transforming the consumer deposit base have truly been transformational for our performance. And I think that's what we're seeing here now that our consumer book is performing. At a worse case, peer-like, but certainly there are signs that we may be outperforming peers. We look at benchmarking. Our DDA balances were almost 300 basis points better than peer average this year, or last year rather, in 2023. And our net deposit growth was actually a couple hundred basis points better than peers as well, while our betas have been modestly better. So you look at that equation, better deposit growth, better beta, really grounded with an outperformance in DDA. That's a good place to be, and I expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in 2024 for our relative outperformance to sustain, and we're seeing those signs already. Having said that, on an absolute basis, what we saw in Q4 was a slowdown in consumers' deterioration and excess stimulus. It's still going on a path of normalizing, so we're still seeing that continue, but the pace of normalization has begun to slow and I think we should see that sustain in the first half of the year as rates start to tick down. On the interest-bearing side, competitive dynamics haven't really shifted yet. It's still fairly aggressive out there on CDs and money markets, but we believe we've got more levers than most with Citizens Access as a platform where we can contain interest bearing growth on the higher cost side, not put contagion, so to speak, into the full retail bank to reprice all of our interest bearing deposits gives us a real competitive advantage. And we're thinking about the private bank in some ways in a similar way. So we've got all the tools to compete. We do expect, as the rate curve follows as projected, interest-bearing deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well. And we're starting to think about a mix of balances. We've got a lot of CDs that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that we'll be looking to have more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage down betas over the course of the year. So all that is to say I feel pretty good about how we are situated. We're starting to see good dynamics with the consumer expected to continue and I've got a lot of confidence that we will outperform peers in whatever environment comes our way.\nManan Gosalia: Great, thank you. And then just to follow up on credit, given the move lower in long end rates, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the non-office CRE portfolio, like maybe in multifamily? How do things like the debt service coverage ratios look today versus a couple of months ago, and how do you expect that to trend given where the forward curve is right now?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah, I would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio, its characteristics, its relatively small loan sizes, a lot of fixed term loans, good diversification geographically. And so we, I think, felt that loss content there was going to be quite low. But now, obviously, with rates ticking down, that provides more kind of air in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows. And so we feel that it's helpful, but we weren't worried all that much previously. So anyway, that's\u2026\nJohn Woods: Yeah, I would just hasten and add that it's very different than general office. I mean the capital markets are still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties and that will just provide further tailwind to that activity.\nBruce Van Saun: There's a lot of liquidity there.\nJohn Woods: Yeah, there's liquidity there. Buyers and sellers are still transacting. So it's just a very different night and day situation compared to general office, and certainly rates which won't have much of an impact maybe on the general office, will very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to begin with.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Very good.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Great, Keeley. Thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with some commentary on 2023. We demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength while delivering solid financial performance. We were resilient through a turbulent environment, benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels and strong liquidity based on stable consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources. This strength allowed us to execute well against our multi-year strategic initiatives while opportunistically building out the private bank. On Slide 6, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS at $3.88, which included a $0.51 drag from non-core, and an $0.11 investment in the private bank. Full year ROTCE was 13.5% after incorporating these items. Before I discuss the details of the fourth quarter results, here are some highlights referencing slides 4, 5, and 7. On the slides you can see we generated underlying net income of $426 million for the fourth quarter and EPS of $0.85. This includes $0.06 for our continued investment in the startup of the private bank and a $0.15 negative impact from the non-core portfolio. We had a significant increase in the impacts from notable items this quarter included on Slide 4. The largest driver was the FDIC special assessment, followed by elevated top and severance related expenses attributable to meaningful headcount reduction. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 11.8%. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTCE of 14.8%. Currently, the private bank startup investment is dilutive to results, but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive. The private bank is off to a very good start, raising about $1.2 billion of deposits through the end of the year, of which more than 30% are non-interest bearing. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it continues to run off, further bolstering our overall performance going forward. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.59%, up from 1.55% in third quarter. This includes a robust 10.2% coverage for general office, up from 9.5% in the prior quarter. We continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter, achieving our planned liquidity profile. Our pro forma Category 1 bank LCR rose to 117% from 109% in the prior quarter. We also reduced our period end flood borrowings by $3.3 billion quarter-over-quarter to $3.8 billion, and our period-end LDR improved linked quarter to 82% from 84%. Regarding strategic initiatives, as previously mentioned, the private bank is off to a great start and TOP continues to contribute. In addition, New York Metro is tracking well, and we are poised to capitalize on the growing private capital opportunity. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail, turning to Slide 8 and starting with net interest income. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, partially offset by a 2% increase in average interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff were more than offset by higher funding costs and swaps, the net impact of which reduced NIM by 3 basis points to the 3% level. The additional 9 basis point decline to 2.91% was due to the impact of our liquidity build which was neutral to NII. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased a modest 3 basis points to 51%, as the Fed has paused and we see continued but slowing deposit migration. We expect this moderating trend to continue until the Fed eventually cuts rates. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally in the pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Moving to Slide 9. Fees were up 2% linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record performance from wealth. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. The improvement in capital markets reflects increased activity with the decline in long rates in November driving a nice pickup in bond underwriting. Equities improved with strength in the back half of the quarter as the environment became more favorable. M&A advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the better macro and rates outlook, although several transactions pushed to Q1. We see capital markets momentum picking up in Q1 as markets are positive and our deal pipelines are strong. The wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in AUM growth. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees as high mortgage rates continued to weigh on lot volumes. The servicing operating P&L improved modestly while the MSR valuation, net of hedging, was lower. On Slide 10, we did well on expenses which were down slightly linked quarter even while including the impact of the continued private bank startup investment. Our reported expense of $1.61 billion increased $319 million, including notable items totaling $323 million, namely the industrywide FDIC special assessment of $225 million, and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into 2024. I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. On Slide 11, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 3% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans which were partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Average commercial [line] (ph) utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next on slides 12 and 13, we continued to do well on deposits. Period end deposits were broadly stable linked quarter with an increase in consumer driven by the private bank offset by lower commercial. The decline in commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits, running off approximately $3.5 billion of higher cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter. Absent this BSO effect, deposits would have been up by about 1.5% this quarter. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are up 19 basis points, which translates to 51% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 71% insured or secure. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories with noninterest bearing now representing about 21% of total deposits. This is slightly below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here, although this will be dependent on the path of rates and customer behavior. Moving on to credit on Slide 14. Net charge-offs were 46 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter. We were pleased to see that commercial charge offs were stable linked quarter, and we also saw a modest decline in criticized loans, as we continued to work through the general office portfolio. We saw continued normalization of charge offs in the retail portfolio along with seasonal impacts. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 15. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.59%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the denominator effect from lower portfolio balances. We increased the reserve for the $3.6 billion general office portfolio to $370 million which represents a coverage of 10.2%, up from 9.5% in the third quarter, as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers. We have already taken $148 million in charge-offs on this portfolio, which is about 4% of loans. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be about 9%. Also, our tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.7% at the end of the year. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers, and you can see on Slide 36 in the appendix where we stand currently relative to peers in the third quarter. We returned a total of $198 million to shareholders through dividends in the fourth quarter. We paused our share repurchases in the fourth quarter in light of the FDIC special assessment. Having exceeded our target capital level for year end, we expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we plan to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size. On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program. First, on Slide 17, the buildout of the private bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum. Following our formal launch in the fourth quarter, our bankers have raised more than $1.2 billion of attractive deposits, with roughly 75% of that from commercial clients. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California. We have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities, with our Clarfeld Wealth Management Business as the centerpiece of that effort. Moving to Slide 18, you are all well aware of our efforts in New York Metro. That's going really well, and we are hitting our targets there. And on the commercial side, as I mentioned before, we are starting to see momentum building in capital markets. This should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital backing private equity gets put to work. Next on Slide 19, we continue to be disciplined on expenses. It's important to remember that a key to Citizens' success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 8 program, achieving a pretax run rate benefit of about $115 million at the end of 2023. And we've launched TOP 9 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $135 million of pretax benefits by the end of 2024. The new TOP program is focused on efficiency opportunities from further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization and save more on third party spend as well. Last year, we exited the auto business, and we also exited the wholesale mortgage business in the fourth quarter. We are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our headcount by about 650, or approximately 3.5%, and we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and are rationalizing some of our corporate and back-office facilities. Given all this work, we are targeting to limit our underlying expense growth in 2024 to roughly 1% to 1.5%, with a net decrease in legacy Citizens expenses of 1.3% to 1.5%, being offset by investments in the private bank. Playing prudent defense is at the top of our priority list given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that began back in March and the uncertain macro outlook. So, we are reworking both sides of the balance sheet through our balance sheet optimization efforts. Slide 20 provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan portfolio through our non-core strategy and optimization on the commercial side with a focus on relationship based lending and attractive risk adjusted returns. On the left side of the page, you'll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining $11 billion non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $6.4 billion from where we were at the end of the year to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025. And as this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction in wholesale funding, with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio. The capital recaptured through reduction in non-core RWA will be primarily reallocated to support attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the private bank. In the broader consumer portfolio, we are targeting growth in the home equity, card and mortgage, which offer the greatest relationship potential. Moving to the right side of the page, we are also working on the commercial portfolio, exiting lower return credit only relationships and focusing on selective C&I lending with multi-product relationship opportunities. We are leading more deals in our front book, improving spreads while also improving the overall return profile of the book. In the appendix, we have included more information covering the broad contours of our BSO program, including how we are managing our high-quality deposit book, remixing our wholesale funding, managing our securities portfolio and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment. Moving to Slide 21, I will take you through our full year 2024 outlook, which contemplates the early January forward curve and a Fed Funds rate of 4.25% by the end of the year. We expect NII to be down 6% to 9%, with changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline, and average loans down roughly 2% to 3%. However, we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 5%, with private bank growing over the course of the year and commercial activity picking up in the second half. On the deposit side, we expect spot growth of 1.2% -- I'm sorry, 1% to 2% and well controlled deposit costs with a terminal beta in the low 50s, before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in May. We expect our net interest margin to trough around the middle of the year and average in the 2.8% to 2.85% range for the full year, and we expect to exit the year around 2.85%. We've included Slide 23, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. In 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 38, which demonstrates how the 2024 headwind, which is incorporated in our 2024 NII guide, reverses to a substantial NII tailwind in 2025 and beyond, as the current forward curve is realized. For example, there is an expected improvement in NII contribution from swaps in 2025 year-over-year of approximately $371 million with continued meaningful benefits in 2026 and 2027. Non-interest income is expected to be up in the 6% to 9% range depending upon market environment, led by a nice rebound in capital markets. We expect expenses to be up about 1% to 1.5%. Excluding the private bank, this would be down 1.3% to 1.5%. We have provided a walk showing the components of our 2024 expense outlook on Slide 22 to provide more context. NCOs are expected to average about 50 basis points for the year as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail. Given macro trends, our remixing of the balance sheet through commercial BSO and the non-core strategy and expectations for modest portfolio growth, we will likely see ACR releases over the course of the year. We plan to resume share repurchases in the first quarter in the $300 million range with more over the course of the year depending upon market conditions and loan growth. Taking that into account, we still expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio of about 10.5%, which is at the upper end of our target range. Putting it all together, we expect to return to sequential positive operating leverage in the second half of the year with PPNR troughing in the second quarter 2024. Moving to slides 24 and 25, as Bruce mentioned, we are well positioned to deliver attractive returns. As we look out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieve a 16% to 18% ROTCE. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business with a substantial NII tailwind given swap portfolio runoff. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage with strong expense discipline and we are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully given the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past few years. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the private bank as it matures and a tailwind from the runoff of the non-core portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity. We will continue to operate with a prudent risk appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over the medium term, we expect our CET1 ratio to remain within a target range of 10% to 10.5%, about 50 basis points higher than our prior target range, given continued uncertainty in the macro environment. On Slide 26, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to lower day count impact on revenue as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. To wrap up, we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in 2023 as we worked to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term. We delivered solid results this quarter and we ended the year with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position that puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise. We are continuing to optimize the balance sheet and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Yeah, I'll just start off and others can add. But I mean I think those are the two drivers, as you mentioned. When we look out into primarily the second half of 2024, we are seeing an expectation that commercial activity will pick up. Loan utilization is flattening out here, we expect early in the year. And then so that'll be part of the driver. We also have had some BSO activity in late \u201823 and early \u201824 that we expect to moderate in the second half of the year as well. So you're going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side. And then on the consumer side of things, we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the mortgage space and in HELOC, which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us. But those are the main drivers. Then, of course, broadly, the private bank, which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side of things in late \u201823, we're going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in \u201824. So those are the big, I would say, components of seeing that spot loan growth. Yeah, just kind of the main drivers of that. It's basically a continuation of some of the trends we're seeing in the fourth quarter of 2023, where capital markets is starting to pick up again, pipelines are incredibly strong. And I think that the lead driver seems to be M&A advisory. That's picked up in 4Q, not only due to seasonal factors, but just in terms of a more constructive backdrop. We're also seeing, as you get in -- out into \u201824, pick up and underwriting, both on the bond side and on the equity side, and so -- and solid contributions from global markets as well. But -- so those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in Q4, continuing in Q1 with excellent pipelines and playing out over the rest of \u201824. Yeah, just to wrap it all that up, in \u201824 we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins. So that's another tailwind if we get into next year in terms of the production business. Yeah, we haven't really talked about that, but I mean, I think what we should look at is that this is accretive to the low-cost profile top of the house. When you look at DDA and operating accounts, it's extremely attractive mix that we've seen come in early days. So we're extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a very sort of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side of -- on the other side of the balance sheet. So, yeah, I would say the mix is quite good and overall cost, very attractive and accretive to top of house. Yeah, just a little bit. I think that all makes sense. And I'd say that the drivers of where you want to be with your reserve is, we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon which is a mile to moderate adverse outcome. So that's built in We think that we're seeing stabilization in terms of the performance of the back book in our loan book. So we see visibility into the charge-off outlook. And then the build, which could be the other driver of ACL when you're building loans, what we're rotating away from and building into, there's actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high quality origination front book in the private bank and commercial that we're putting on the portfolio in \u201824 while other stuff, maybe a higher ACL load is running off in the back book. So those are the things I would just add to what Bruce said. Yeah, and I just would reiterate our capital priorities are a strong dividend, and if we have opportunities to put capital to work, serving clients and driving great really strong risk-adjusted returns. That's our preference. And when that moderates a bit, that's when you see us give it back in the form of buybacks. And so we're in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity to trade. That's it. Yeah, I mean, I would say that we're very close to neutral one way or the other, really up or down. And -- but I'd say that I think what's important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter. And it continued this quarter. We expect it to continue next quarter. But, our outlook is until you get that first cut, it still doesn't completely go away. So we have an expectation the first cut comes in the second quarter and we get down to around 4.25%. I think that's still holding around. We're looking out the window today in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate. I would say that if there's a slight bias, if the cuts came in a little fewer this year, that would probably be okay. But nevertheless, that first cut is key. And a general normalization in an orderly fashion over time is what we think is very good for our balance sheet. Again, staying around neutral with maybe a slight benefit if rates come in a tiny bit higher in \u201824. Yeah. Yeah, I'd say we're basically -- we've achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity bill. This is the headline there. And it's -- we believe a very strong kind of position being around 117% of the requirements for Category 1 banks. I think that matches our objectives and therefore going forward you will not see liquidity being a headwind to net interest. Yeah, I mean, I think that is the driver. Basically, that we are looking at NII being at 70% of our revenues. So yeah, the NII's going to bottom in that quarter as well. Yeah [indiscernible] later. But PPNR troughs in 2Q. Yeah. And I think we're mentioning that the NIM trough is 3Q, but the PPNR NII trough is in 2Q. Yeah, it's a big driver. I mean, I think the big puts and takes there. I mean, you've got the swap portfolio, which is a big tailwind as we've talked about. But if you go over to the deposit side of things, we are looking at deposit migration stabilizing around mid \u201824 after that first cut in May. You see deposit migration stabilizing. And then as cuts continue, we start flipping to down beta type of expectations versus the up beta. And we look at the early 2000s as being instructive for a lot of this, where that tightening -- that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would imply a 35% to 40% down beta for the first call it 100 to 150 basis points. And so that's a good, I think, yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle, our down beta will be less than the full up beta, so our full up beta is low 50s, but nevertheless we're going to get big contributions from down beta and that will grow over time getting close to where the up beta ended up. Well, I would say, well, we're exiting \u201824 at 2.85%. We've indicated that's where fourth quarter of \u201823 is going to -- no, fourth quarter of \u201824 will be. And so that's headed to the 3.25% to 3.40% range. And so you would see us crossing that 3% level in \u201825 sometime, on the way to 3.25%. Yeah, maybe I'll just start off with that, Gerard, it's John. I mean, I think, our fees to total revenues are in the neighborhood of 25%. And I'd say over the medium term, you're going to see that migrate closer to 30%. And that would be consistent with a balance sheet optimization efforts where all of the capital we're putting to work on the front book would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and fee-based opportunities associated with it at a much greater rate than what we're seeing running off in the back book. And so that's going to drive that fee percentage up closer to 30%. And I think that the returns that we expect from a, call it, the ROTCE return that you're seeing in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets that's north of 1%. So you see that getting closer to 125 basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side. Yeah, and maybe just add -- just a quick add to that is that even if the Basel III endgame had gone through as initially proposed, a very modest impact from an RWA standpoint on us. And as it relates to AOCI, as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting that likely survives. But in our case, we're at 9% by deducting the AOCI opt-in, and that's an incredibly strong number. So we sort of think about what's going on there is really behind us and really in the run rate, if you will, when it comes to that. Yeah, and I think we had a 95% capital return with performance in \u201823, so it's in that 75% to 100% range over time. Yeah, I would just hasten and add that it's very different than general office. I mean the capital markets are still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties and that will just provide further tailwind to that activity. Yeah, there's liquidity there. Buyers and sellers are still transacting. So it's just a very different night and day situation compared to general office, and certainly rates which won't have much of an impact maybe on the general office, will very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to begin with."

            "content": "Yeah. I think if you look back at the fourth quarter, the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were it's about 50% utilization, 50% BSO with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there. So people that were carrying slightly higher balances on the commercial side, a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed off in the last six weeks of the year. And that's continued into this year. So I think the particular area that we're excited about as we get into the back end of 2024 is the private equity space. I mean, that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years. There's lots of conversations going on. We're hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active and that'll drive utilization on our capital call lines, which is at an all-time low right now. So, I think that's what the real driver is."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was an incredible year in many respects. With the Fed's aggressive moves to subdue inflation, the West Coast bank failures, a surprisingly resilient economy, and several significant proposals from bank regulators, it was important in navigating this dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense while continuing to play disciplined offense and take advantage of opportunities in the market. Defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management, and I feel really good about how we ended the year. Our capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, CET1 adjusted for AOCI of roughly 9% and a tangible common equity ratio of 6.7%. Our liquidity position is at an all-time best with a loan to deposit ratio of 82%, pro forma Category 1 LCR of 117% and 156% liquidity coverage of our uninsured deposits. Our ACL ratio is at 159% compared to 130% pro forma day 1 CECL, and general office reserves are at 10.2%. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships which deliver stronger relative returns. We are using a non-core strategy to run off loans and free capital for better opportunities. On offense, we have several important initiatives we are driving, such as the private bank buildout, the New York City Metro initiative, our focus on serving private capital and growing our payments business. These are all tracking well. In particular, we are pleased to see the private bank team reach $1.2 billion in deposits soon after our launch in late October. Our financials over the course of the year came under some pressure, primarily given higher funding costs. Nonetheless, we delivered a 13.5% underlying ROTCE for the full year, with a 95% return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see smaller sequential declines in NII than in the prior quarter as the Fed last hiked in July and the pressure on funding costs has lessened. We saw a modest bounce back in fees, but are very encouraged by the tone of the markets in 2024 to date. Hopefully, we start to see our big capital markets pipelines begin to deliver. We took some meaningful cost actions in Q4 to set the stage for a very modest expense growth in 2024. We only had the private bank for two quarters, so if you normalize for that, we're actually reducing the legacy expense base by 1.4%. I should reinforce though that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives. Credit outlook continues to track expectations. CRE general office is being carefully managed. Losses are being absorbed in net charge offs. It's relatively predictable with few surprises so far. Away from that, credit quality is strong. In Q4 we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio which is a promising sign. On the capital front, we did not buy in any stock in Q4, given the charges related to the FDIC special surcharge as well as associated with our cost initiatives. We expect to be back in the market in Q1, and for that to continue through 2024. Turning to our outlook, we expect NII to continue with modest declines through midyear and then start to tick up. The exciting news on NIM/NII is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and noncore runoff over \u201825 to \u201827, which will power higher EPS and returns. We are poised for strong fee growth led by capital markets. Net charge offs will rise modestly, but we are likely to see ACL releases over the course of the year. Our key priorities for 2024 will be to continue to operate with a strong defense/prudent offense mindset. We have many exciting things on our technology, our digital, data analytics and AI roadmap that we need to deliver on. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We feel we are well positioned for medium-term outperformance. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering in great effort in 2023. We know we can count on you again in the new year. With that, let me turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. Keeley, let's open it up for Q&A. Good morning. Maybe, Brendan, you could talk a little bit about what you expect for private bank lending. Okay. Great. Don, anything to add on the commercial side? Great. Peter, did you have another question? John? You might add something on wealth, Brendan. I don't know if you want to. We expect continued really strong growth on wealth fees. Okay, very good. Okay. Thank you, Peter. Next question. Yeah. I'll start off here. But I think we have been very, very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies. There's always the playbook where if you kind of eliminate your bottom X percent of performers and redistribute some of the work that you can run a little leaner. And so we've gone through that exercise to make sure that we won't be caught short in any areas. We carved out important areas like risk and audit and some of the control areas so they were spared kind of from taking reductions. And then we also carved out the areas that are important investment activities. And so, the rollup of all that, Matt, comes to a relatively modest number, 3.5% of total staff count. But I think we're kind of lean and mean and in good fighting shape as we enter into 2024. Yeah, I would -- there's a Slide 11, Matt, that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits, but DDA and then checking with interest, which are very low costs, roughly 40%, very little term, and most of that in kind of liquid savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what we're offering to the core franchise. Hi. Yeah. So I'll start and then John can then give some more color. So I think that the kind of push that we've seen higher over the course of '23, that could continue a little bit higher into \u201824. So going from 46, say, to 50 is kind of twofold for the most part. One is that CRE general office is, we're watching the maturity wall and we're on top of all these credits very carefully and we're working them out. And as I said in my opening remarks, a lot of this is fairly predictable. So kind of we can look ahead six months, nine months, we can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take charge-offs. And so I think we have good visibility into that. It's a long process on CRE General Office. I think we'll have this with us all through \u201824 and likely into \u201825 as well. But again, the important thing is, I think we're well-reserved for it, and it's baked into that charge-off run rate. The second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side, which has been extremely slow and gradual, but we're still slightly better than where we were pre-COVID. And so that will just gently push up as we go forward. And so that would be the other driver. I'd say the good news is that in C&I, we're not really seeing any kind of hotspots and so we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad C&I through 2024. On the question of the ACL is, this year we've been consistently building each quarter. And if you get to the scenario where there's likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession, we've put away enough reserves that I think we will be able to start to draw that down. And so time will tell on that, but you can already see that we've been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve bill from absolute provision over charge-offs in this quarter. It was flat. It was $171 million over $171 million. And so even if charge-offs can pick up a little bit, I think it's likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed charge-offs reduce as we go through the year. I don't know, John, if you want to add any color to that. Well, at this point, we've given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about $300 million. So we probably, with benefit of 2020 hindsight, could have bought some in the fourth quarter, but water under the bridge for [10/6] (ph). So we have a little above-target capital to kind of play with, if you will, in the first quarter. And then in the first half of the year, we're not going to have much net loan growth. Non-core is going to be running down, and we don't really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the private banking commercial, as John indicated. So I think the buybacks would tend to be more first half oriented, but a lot can happen over the course of the year. And so I kind of defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate just to say we'll have a solid print in the first quarter and likely more in a second quarter and then we'll see how the year plays out. And one last add-on point to your add-on point is I would say I'm really happy to be buying my stock at these levels because we think it's great value. Good morning. Yeah, good question. I would say the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives. So we've mentioned the private bank and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big success. And we've been investing in the New York marketplace and certainly to get your brand awareness up is expensive proposition, but we're doing that and that is showing very good results. There are certain businesses like payments that are, I think, going through a lot of change and that change always presents opportunities. And so making sure that we're investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain share and grow that business, those are the things that kind of come top of mind that we're very focused on. I think in terms of acquisitions and our fee-based capabilities, we've made significant investments over time in commercial. And so our M&A size and scale is at quite a good level. So we could be selective there. Don't see anything imminent, but there's possibilities that if there's an industry vertical that makes sense, maybe we could do something there. And then wealth, we've been looking at trying to buy some things. We bought Clarfeld, which turned out to be a fantastic acquisition, but I think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the lift-out route and to bring teams onto the platform. And so we're hard at work on that to try to scale up Citizens' private wealth. So I would say the franchise is in good shape. There's a lot of initiatives in place that will, I think, have us outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers. So I think we can sit back and be selective in terms of deploying capital inorganically. Yeah, I mean there's always opportunities to look to flex your expense base down. I think we've been pretty hard at it here to get to this level. And I'd say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility, but again, if you're looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with $0.03 to $0.05 or something of that magnitude, if that puts at jeopardy your trajectory on things like private bank, it wouldn't appear to be a really advisable decision to take. So we will always look at that. You know you can trust us to do that. But at this point, we're trying to manage for both near-term delivery but also with an eye towards the medium term and really getting that ROTCE back into the kind of targeted range. Good morning. The other aspect to that too is just we've had an inverted curve for a long time. So, when you think about the medium term, presumably we get back to a point where there's a normal yield curve, which also benefits NII. I think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year. It affected us in Q3. It affected us in Q4. If you actually look at, I think, one of the dialogues on these calls a way back, are we going to exit the year close to 3% underlying? Well, we actually did do that. The underlying performance on our NIM was quite good. It only dropped 3 basis points, which is showing up well relative to everybody who's reported so far. But that liquidity build, which is neutral to NII, took us down another 9. So we end up exiting closer to [290 than to the 3] (ph). But that liquidity build is kind of done. And so we can just focus on not having that, exercising that from the conversation and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out. But in Q3, Ken, then you'd have other things kicking in, like fee growth strong, long growth starting to kick in. And so even though the swap is incremental, forward starting swaps, then I think we'd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would allow us to absorb that. Hey, Gerard. John, you're answering at the comprehensive company on that MTO page. I think, Gerard, is focused more specifically on the private bank mix. But there, I would say, it will build over time, the fee percentage, as we kind of get the wealth cross-sell. But we should at least be at kind of where we are today in 75%-25%, and then I think there's kind of upside from that over time. And I do think the spread on the private bank assets is very significant today, given the high percentage of low-cost deposits in there. We haven't really seen the loans come on in size yet, but generally capital call lines tend to be priced with a nice return. And I think some of the other business lending and HELOCs and things that will maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well. So I think if you looked at kind of mature private banking models to have a 20% to 25% return on equity is realistic. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add to that at all? Yeah, I would say that for banks of our size, the things that we've focused the most on have been RWA increases to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply, the appetite to lend in those areas because it would erode the economics. So things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines attracting capital and small business lending attracting more capital. I think those flaws in the proposal have been well chronicled. And even though they don't result in a meaningful RWA inflation for us, I mean, we're stewards of the US economy and we'd like to see those things adjusted. That's been for kind of banks our size. I think the kind of main thing at top of the list, I think the operational risk kind of increases affect the bigger banks more, but nonetheless they seem to have a fairly big bump on the scale. And so that likely, I think, will have a rethink. And maybe those come down to some extent. That would benefit everybody, but probably the big banks more than banks like ourselves. I think that's a good point that John just raised, Gerard, is that given the strength of our capital position both pre- and post-AOCI, we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts, but really not worry about them. Many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up and getting in position and having to kind of hold back on capital distribution which is really not something that we're worried about given this capital strength. So we're more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catch up, which is a good position to be in. That's right, if you go back to the time of the IPO and the number's been over 100% and under 100% and all over the place, but if you just looked at like a 10-year average, almost 10 years, it's about 75%. And so having enough capital to actually grow your business and lend to customers, you have to certainly work that into the equation. But to the extent, as John stated the priorities, dividend is number one, using capital to support organic growth principally in the loan book and then repurchasing shares. I think if we get our returns into that level, we'll be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders both through the dividend and through consistent share repurchases. We should be viewed as a capital return story. Brendan, you want to take that? Yeah, I would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio, its characteristics, its relatively small loan sizes, a lot of fixed term loans, good diversification geographically. And so we, I think, felt that loss content there was going to be quite low. But now, obviously, with rates ticking down, that provides more kind of air in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows. And so we feel that it's helpful, but we weren't worried all that much previously. So anyway, that's... There's a lot of liquidity there. Okay. Very good. Okay. Great, Keeley. Thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yeah, sure. Well, I would start by -- just a quick comment on Q4 for the private bank. Obviously, strong deposit print and I think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified and led by wealth and deposits and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationship. So we're really excited about the print and the start by the team. Having said that, we do expect lending to pick up steam in 2024. Given the interest rate environment, mortgages are obviously challenged on the retail side. So the lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending, which has skewed in the private equity and venture space, which we're really comfortable with the risk appetite and the profile of that business. And it's been critical to start to dislodge personal private banking relationships from the ecosystem of private equity and venture. So we're off to a really good start. I suspect, given the forward curves, that the first half of the year will continue to be led by commercial principally and private equity and venture lending. Over time, we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending, home equity lending, mortgage lending coming in at scale as the rate environment dictates opportunities there. We also expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity venture with private banking and personal banking. So you'll start to see an asset diversification over time, but the first half of the year, we would expect it to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side. We do, and we spent a year of slow and steady progression continuing to get all-time highs in the wealth management business. But given the private bank investment, 2024 is going to be a really important year. We're out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent. We've made a number of key hires in Q4, both on the leadership side as well as at the advisor side. And so getting the ecosystem of the bankers that we hired in the summer, connected with top and market wealth managers is critical for us. We're rebranding the platform to Citizen private wealth management to connect the private banking and wealth side together hand in glove. And so we do expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time really connected into the private banking ecosystem. So we're pleased with the momentum, but there's a lot more to come and we hope if we execute well on the private banking initiative. Yeah, so John hit some highlights on Q4 for mortgage. Production was down a bit. Our underlying servicing business was up modestly. And then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in Q3, Q4. I think as we look the outlook going forward, we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage business. If you rewind the clock back to prior to the Franklin American acquisition, we were under scale in mortgage and really were trying to diversify the business. We've done that really successfully in hindsight. It was an incredibly well-timed acquisition and we performed exceptionally well through the COVID years. And as we exit that period of time and look forward, our MSR concentration versus peers is really strong. It's a little bit on the high side. We looked at our business model and said, wholesale mortgage, we're one of the only lenders in there. The margins were really challenged and the outlook for rates don't necessarily suggest a [boom lift] (ph) of refi activity in the medium term. And so wholesale mortgage being a non-relationship business, we decided that it was time to move on and we're committed to correspond it. We're really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending. But despite rates coming down, we do expect the mortgage market to be, call it, a $2 trillion originations platform in 2024, which is about a normalized mortgage market. So we should see some modest uptick in originations. And with rates coming back down, the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure. So I think we feel like we're in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance with where we're at Q4, within a range of normal volatility. And we're going to make sure that we're executing on driving up returns higher and making sure allocating balance sheets to deep relationship based customers, whether it's in the private bank or in the core retail business, to continue to offer that product to our very best customers. I think it's well said. I won't repeat it. I just would reiterate that I think the performance in Q4 is in line with what we would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time. Obviously, more loan growth on the come and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale and recall our targets end of 2025 are $11 billion in deposits, $9 billion in loans, and $10 billion in AUM. So if we deliver that profile, the kind of expense composition, the profitability profile we're seeing so far is aligned with that return. So we're going to work hard to deliver it and hopefully our performance from Q4 sustains in the first half. Yeah, sure, I'll take that. Well, let me start big picture and then give you a little color on Q4 and expectations. So we've been talking for years that the investments we've made in transforming the consumer deposit base have truly been transformational for our performance. And I think that's what we're seeing here now that our consumer book is performing. At a worse case, peer-like, but certainly there are signs that we may be outperforming peers. We look at benchmarking. Our DDA balances were almost 300 basis points better than peer average this year, or last year rather, in 2023. And our net deposit growth was actually a couple hundred basis points better than peers as well, while our betas have been modestly better. So you look at that equation, better deposit growth, better beta, really grounded with an outperformance in DDA. That's a good place to be, and I expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in 2024 for our relative outperformance to sustain, and we're seeing those signs already. Having said that, on an absolute basis, what we saw in Q4 was a slowdown in consumers' deterioration and excess stimulus. It's still going on a path of normalizing, so we're still seeing that continue, but the pace of normalization has begun to slow and I think we should see that sustain in the first half of the year as rates start to tick down. On the interest-bearing side, competitive dynamics haven't really shifted yet. It's still fairly aggressive out there on CDs and money markets, but we believe we've got more levers than most with Citizens Access as a platform where we can contain interest bearing growth on the higher cost side, not put contagion, so to speak, into the full retail bank to reprice all of our interest bearing deposits gives us a real competitive advantage. And we're thinking about the private bank in some ways in a similar way. So we've got all the tools to compete. We do expect, as the rate curve follows as projected, interest-bearing deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well. And we're starting to think about a mix of balances. We've got a lot of CDs that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that we'll be looking to have more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage down betas over the course of the year. So all that is to say I feel pretty good about how we are situated. We're starting to see good dynamics with the consumer expected to continue and I've got a lot of confidence that we will outperform peers in whatever environment comes our way."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin. \nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color.  We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.  And with that, I will hand over to Bruce. \nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through a challenging environment. Our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we grew our CET1 ratio to 10.4% near the top of peers, while still buying in $250 million in stock with Non-Core loan runoff of $1.4 billion and deposit growth of $500 million in the quarter, we lowered our spot loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% at quarter end. We focused on building up our liquidity even further, given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of travel, adding almost $4 billion to cash and securities.  We also built our ACL further to 1.55%, well above our pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of 1.3% and with our General Office reserve now at 9.5%. While the balance sheet has been a principal focus, we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, which should drive strong medium-term performance. Our Private Bank is being built out. We had a soft launch during the back half of Q3, and we brought in around $500 million in deposits and investments.  Full launch is scheduled over the next several weeks. We're executing well on our New York City Metro push, our deposit strategies, our TOP programs, our ESG initiatives and our payment strategy.  Our underlying EPS for the quarter missed the mark slightly at $0.89 as several capital markets deals slipped from Q3 to Q4, given late quarter market volatility. This was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third quarter of 2020, three years ago and prior to several acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital. The good news here is that the pipelines remain strong and we continue to maintain and grow our market share. NII expenses and credit costs all track to expectations.  We included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck, Page 5, which breaks out results for our legacy core business, our Private Bank start-up investment and the drag from Non-Core. Note the legacy core performance shows Q3 EPS of $1.08, NIM of 3.33% and ROTCE of 15.3%. The Private Bank should turn positive by mid-'24 and be nicely accretive in 2025 and Non-Core will dramatically run down over the next several quarters. This dynamic will help offset the drag from forward starting swaps and help propel results higher over time. Given the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates, we've initiated a zero-based review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in 2024. We'll report further on this on our January call when we give 2024 guidance.  For Q4, we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize. NII will decline, but by less than in the past 2 quarters. Fees should bounce back somewhat, though the extent is market dependent. Expenses and credit costs should be stable, and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan runoff. This has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like Citizens. Rest assured, we are working hard. We're navigating the current turbulence well, and we're taking the actions to position us well for the medium term.  And with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John? \nJohn Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter, referencing Slides 5 and 6. For the third quarter, we generated underlying net income of $448 million and EPS of $0.89, this includes the Private Bank start-up investment of $0.05 and a negative $0.14 impact from the Non-Core portfolio.  Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 12.5%. On Slide 5, you'll see that we provided a schedule separating out our Non-Core runoff portfolio and the start-up investment in our new Private Bank from our legacy core results, so you can see how those impact our performance. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underwriting ROTCE of 15.3%. Currently, the Private Bank startup investment is a drag to results, but relatively quickly, this will become increasingly accretive, 5% EPS benefit in 2025. Similarly, while Non-Core is currently a sizable drag to revenues, it will run off quickly, further bolstering our overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forward starting swaps.  Back to Slide 6. Total net interest income was down 4% linked quarter, and our margin was 3.03%, down 14 basis points, both in line with expectations. Deposits were up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing resilience of the franchise. We continued our balance sheet optimization efforts, further strengthening liquidity during the quarter given the uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations, increasing cash and securities by about $4 billion.  In addition, the Non-Core portfolio declined by $1.4 billion, ending the quarter at $12.3 billion. While we await clarity on new liquidity rules for Category 4 banks, it is worth pointing out that we currently exceed the current LCR requirements for both Category 1 and 3 banks. Our period-end LDR improved to 84%, while our credit metrics remained solid with net charge-offs of 40 basis points, stable linked quarter.  We recorded a provision for credit losses of $172 million and a reserve build of $19 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.55%, up from 1.52% at the end of the second quarter with the increase primarily directed to raising the General Office portfolio reserves from 8% in 2Q to 9.5% at the end of 3Q.  We repurchased $250 million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.4%, up from 10.3% in the second quarter. And our tangible book value per share decreased 3% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates.  Turning to Slide 7 on net interest income. Linked-quarter results were down 4% as expected, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 14 basis points to 3.03%. As you can see from the walk at the bottom of the slide, the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing, which includes mix shift from lower cost to higher interest-bearing categories, noninterest-bearing deposit migration as well as the mix impact of the liquidity build I mentioned earlier. These factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and rundown of the Non-Core portfolio.  Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 48% through 3Q and which has been rising in response to the rate cycle and competitive environment. Our deposit franchise has performed well with deposit betas generally in the back of peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral, down slightly versus the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 8. Fees were down 3% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees, partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees. The Capital Markets fees outlook was positive early in September, but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up to the end of the month, we saw a number of M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter, resulting in lower linked quarter M&A advisory fees as well as lower bond underwriting. While we continue to see good strength in our deal pipeline, uncertainty continues around the timing of these deals closing given the level of market volatility.  Card fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower balance transfer fees. The increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher MSR valuation, the servicing P&L provides a diversifying benefit, which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production as higher mortgage rates weighed on lock volumes.  On Slide 9, we did well on expenses, keeping them broadly stable linked quarter, excluding the $35 million Private Bank start-up investment.  On Slide 10, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 1% linked quarter. The Non-Core portfolio runoff of $1.4 billion drove the overall decline, partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Period-end core loans are stable. Average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients look to deleverage given the environment and higher rates. We saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment.  Next, to Slide 11 and 12. We continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were up $530 million linked quarter, with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits broadly stable. Our interest bearing deposit costs were up 39 basis points, which translates to a 48% cumulative beta.  Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, and with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 70% insurers secured. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this rising rate environment. As rates rose in the third quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories with noninterest-bearing now representing about 22% of total deposits. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and we would expect the decline to moderate from here, although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and consumer behavior.  Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points stable linked quarter with a decrease in commercial, offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto, which normalized following a very low second quarter result. Non-accrual loans increased 9% linked quarter to 87 basis points of total loans, reflecting an increase in General Office. We feel the rate of increase in non-accruals is decelerating after a jump in Q2.  Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.55%, which is a 3 basis point increase from the second quarter, which reflects a reserve build of $19 million as well as the denominator effect from the rundown of the Non-Core portfolio. We increased our General Office coverage to 9.5% from 8% in the second quarter. You can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the General Office portfolio to $354 million this quarter, which represents coverage of 9.5% against the $3.7 billion portfolio. We have already taken $100 million in charge offs in this portfolio, which is about 2.5% of loans. In setting the General Office reserve, we are factoring in a very severe peak to trough decline in office values of about 68% with remaining 18% to 20% default rate and a loss severity of about 50%. So we feel the current coverage of 9.5% is very strong. It's worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our outlook would be manageable given our strong reserve and capital position.  We have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan by loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower specific elements to de-risk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. I should also note that about 99.2% of CRE General Office is in current pay status. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.4% as we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank regulators. We returned a total of $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size.  Turning to Slide 16 and 17. I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, so that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slide 16, we've included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving performance over the medium term. On the commercial side, we highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Although deal activity has been relatively muted recently, many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to deploy. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity given the right market conditions.  We have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor lead tables. And our new private bankers will significantly expand our sponsor relationships, and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when sponsor activity picks up. We also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payment space, and we've been investing in our Treasury Solutions business developing integrated payments platforms and expanding our client hedging capabilities.  On the consumer side, our entry into New York Metro is going very well with some early success attracting new customers to the bank and growing deposits about 9x faster than in our legacy branches, as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The build-out of the Private Bank is also going very well. These bankers have hit the ground running and have already brought in around $500 million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half of Q3. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more like Florida and California.  We plan to open a few Private Banking centers in these geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with our Clarfeld legacy Wealth business as the centerpiece of that effort.  Turning to Slide 17 on the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program, which is progressing well. The chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the Non-Core portfolio, which is comprised of our $9 billion shorter-duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $7.6 billion from where we are now to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025, and as this run found, we plan to redeploy the majority of cash paydowns to building core bank liquidity with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio.  The capital recaptured through reduction in Non-Core RWA will be reallocated to support the growth of the Private Bank. In summary, this strategy strengthens liquidity has already been a source of about $3 billion of term funding ABS issuance this year. It builds capital by reducing RWAs and it's accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE.  Next to our TOP program on the right side of the slide. Our latest program is well underway and on target to deliver a $115 million pretax run rate benefit by year-end. Our TOP programs are essential to improving returns over the medium term and we are ready to launch on top 9, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in third-party spend as well.  In light of pressure on revenue given the rate environment, we are targeting to keep 2024 underlying expenses flat. On the technology front, we have a very extensive agenda with a multiyear next-gen tech cloud migration, targeting the exit of all of our data centers by 2025 and the program to converge our core deposit system onto a cloud-based modern banking platform. We've come a long way in modernizing our platform since the IPO.  And on the ESG front, we recently announced a $50 billion sustainable finance target, which we plan to achieve by 2030 and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. And we are working diligently to help our clients prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy.  Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 18. Our outlook incorporates the Private Bank and assumes that the Federal rate steady through the end of the year. We expect NII to be down approximately 2% next quarter, given the impact from noninterest-bearing and low-cost deposits migrating to higher cost categories, albeit at a decelerating rate, more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields, Non-Core runoff and day count.  Based on the forward curve, we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of 2023 to be approximately 50% and to rise to a terminal level of low 50s percent before the first rate cut. Noninterest income is expected to be up 3% to 4% with a seasonal pickup in capital markets depending on the market environment. Noninterest expense should be broadly stable, which includes the Private Bank and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Net charge-offs are expected to rise to approximately mid-40s basis points as we continue to work through the General Office portfolio and expected further normalization. We feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level and the ACL level will continue to benefit from loan runoff.  Our CET1 is expected to increase to approximately 10.5%, with the opportunity to engage in a modest level of share repurchases, the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Beyond the 4Q '23 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting flat 2024 underlying expenses. This includes the Private Bank on the Non-Core portfolio and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Also, we've included Slide 25 in the appendix on the swaps impact through 2027. We expect higher swap expense in 2024 to be partly offset by the benefit to NII from the Non-Core rundown.  Notably, the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over 2025 through 2027 as swaps run off and the Fed normalizes short rates. In addition, the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in '26 and 2027.  To wrap up, we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment. Importantly, we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized and if the environment becomes more challenging. Our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. \nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Greg, why don't we open it up for some Q&A. \nErika Najarian: My first question is for John. John, there has been a lot of feedback from investors on uncertainty over the NII trajectory for '24 in the environment of higher for longer. And I think you know where I'm going here. I think that investors are trying to sort of square the $11 billion, $12 billion increase in notional swaps, right, at a received fixed rate of 3.10% in the second half of next year and trying to square that in a higher for longer environment with some of the balance sheet optimization. So if you could just sort of take us through a little bit of the moving pieces and perhaps simplify it for the investors listening in terms of how that impacts your NII trough timing, what happens after you hit trough and are you still confident in what you said, I guess, a month ago and that you could exit 4Q '24 with a 3% NIM? \nJohn Woods: Thanks, Erika. Maybe I'll take that a little bit in reverse order because it may help us with the jump off conversation. So we -- net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter. So we've talked about that at 3.03%. I think that the two big forces that I would talk about broadly as you look out into the fourth quarter, would be our basic ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out.  So I'd say that if you look at overall net interest margin, I'd say that we're going to see another, call it, mid-single-digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity build. And so that 3.03% kind of gets to close, it comes in right around that 3%. So that's kind of playing out the way we expected, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration, I'd say that, that's holding about where we think it should be. The other item, as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck is the fact that given the uncertainty and regulatory environment, we've endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way. That liquidity build is NII neutral. But it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin. And so you could see that being an impact in the fourth quarter, so it was a couple -- maybe 2 basis points or so in the third quarter. That could be maybe another, call it several basis points as you get into the fourth quarter. So you can see things playing out as we expect in the fourth quarter.  When you basically get to the 2024 dynamics, once you reset the table in the fourth quarter, the big puts and takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into -- it's flattish when you get in the first half of the year, but it rises in the second half of the year. It happens that as it relates to '24, that's about when the forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in. So I'd say that when you think about some of the mitigants to the outlook, with the swap portfolio, you're going to have potentially the Fed beginning to cut in the second half of 2024. You have the ongoing benefit of the Non-Core portfolio. You've got the growing accretive contributions from the Private Bank. And with long range being where they are, asset front book, back book is will contribute positively.  And then just the broader balance sheet optimization efforts that we're doing across the bank. I think are all the areas that I would highlight as nice mitigants to what we're seeing play out. Let's see where the rate environment plays out. I mean the forwards have it in 1 place. We have Bloomberg economist consensus are probably 50 basis points lower than where the forwards are. But I mean, Nevertheless, we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and, frankly, growing momentum as you exit 2024 on the net interest margin. \nErika Najarian : And just to clarify, are you still confident that you could exit taking all out account -- exit 4Q '24 have a NIM of about 3%. And based on sort of what you're telling us, it sounds like the -- if the Fed doesn't cut as the forward curve indicated, that would be the risk to that 3%. \nJohn Woods: Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, I'd say that we're all else equal we're getting around that 3% level, depending upon the impact of liquidity builds, which are NII neutral. That is that liquidity build piece that I would say, which is kind of sort of set that aside, just given where we are, it doesn't drive NII. So you're thinking about the net interest margin that drives NII, we're going to be in that neighborhood of 3% ex liquidity build. \nErika Najarian: Got it. And I'm going to step back after this because I think I'm taking up too much time. I just want to clarify I'm asking about 4Q '24. Are you talking about 4Q '23? I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page. \nJohn Woods: 4Q '23, yes, sorry, I need to make sure that was clear, all everything I was just saying was about in that last bit was that we're getting around that 3% level, give or take, at the -- in 4Q '23 ex liquidity build and the liquidity build is NII neutral. So if you're trying to think about where we're driving NII, it's around that plus or minus 3% level ex liquidity build. For 2023 and all the other forces that we talked about earlier, we're -- as you're going into '24, when I was ticking off the tailwinds from Non-Core, Private Bank, asset front book, back book and BSO, all of those are tailwinds into '24, which will be mitigants along with, let's see where the rate cuts actually start kicking in, in the second half of '24.  And we'll see where we exit 2024. But that's something we'll come back to you on in terms of adding more color in January as we typically do. And we'll assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. \nScott Siefers: I guess I want to revisit that fourth quarter margin just to make sure everybody is on the same page. But the reported margin, it sounds like will be below the 3%, however, right, because you do -- and I know it will be dependent on liquidity build, but it sounds like you do anticipate liquidity build. So will we be talking kind of something in the [mid-2.90s]? Would that be sort of the reported expectation? \nJohn Woods: It will be lower. It just depends on the NII neutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate. So it's sort of -- it's -- I think it's useful to talk about an ex liquidity build, given the fact that that's the driver of NII, and there'll be possibly additional -- just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded, it will be -- that's flat to NII, but it will be a denominator effect that would take the NIM below that plus or minus 3% that I talked about before, but not an NII driver. \nScott Siefers : Yes. Okay. All right. Perfect. And then maybe as we look out just in terms of sort of the handoff from the Non-Core loan runoff to more visible Private Bank growth. When do we sort of think that will become sort of more neutral from -- in terms of visibility to the balance sheet? Like when would we expect the loan portfolio to sort of level out? \nJohn Woods: Yes. I think that we were saying that we think that the Non-Core runoff will be a continued driver of sort of in the first half of -- in 4Q and the first half of '24, you'll see some declines in the loan portfolio. But in the second half of '24, we start seeing the Private Bank contributing as well as organic contribution starting to see loan growth such that year-over-year, we would have an expectation you'd see us starting to see loan growth in the second half of '24. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. \nPeter Winter: Just -- I was wondering on the credit side, we've just seen, in general, some pre-announcements on charge-offs in the shared national credit space. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to shared national credits and how you fared in the recent exam? \nDon McCree: So do you want me to take that, John? \nJohn Woods: Sure.\nDon McCree : So, just in general, as I think -- there's a lot of focus on shared national credits. Actually, when we came through the exam this year, we had more upgrades than we had downgrades. So we didn't have any forced charge-offs in terms of our shared national credit book. We've been taking our participations down as part of our BSO exercise. We've there about 10 basis points -- 10% lower than they were a couple of quarters ago. I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credit. We treat participations or share of national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension. So one, it has to return people think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning. We go through the exact same process, whether we're participating or leading a transaction or a sole lender. And then also, we do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make, whether it be shared national credit extension or not. So our SNC book doesn't perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank. And actually, in some cases, it's larger credits, so they might perform marginally better than some of the middle market assets that we have on the book over time. \nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. And I think just as part of BSO, as Bruce said, as part of BSO in general, we're kind of looking at the total relationship returns. And if we went into credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and become a more important bank, that's not panning out. We're not getting the cross-sell we anticipated, then we're extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity. So I think you'll continue to see that trend. \nDon McCree: Yes. And let me just pick up on that. Just in the last quarter, back to the loan growth question, we had about $900 million front book loan originations, offset by about $1.6 billion of BSO activity. So we're really churning the book towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that Bruce mentioned. And I think a lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing. We see people supporting their lead bank relationships and moving away from more speculative future opportunities. \nPeter Winter : Got it. And then -- just can you just provide a little bit more color maybe on the deposit repricing and migration and how you see it playing out with a longer -- higher for longer rates just impacting the deposit pricing pressures?\nJohn Woods : Yes, I'll go and handle that. I mean, I'd say, first off, I mean, I think when you look at our performance from a deposit beta standpoint, we feel like we're basically in the pack with what you're seeing across the industry, which is a really positive results compared to where we were last cycle, which is part of the ongoing investments we've been making in primacy and product capabilities and delivering the entire bank for our customers. So we're really kind of pleased to see where we -- how things are playing out cycle to date.  That said, we still are -- and frankly, when you look at the overall metric of noninterest-bearing to overall deposits were around 22%. That's basically back to where we were pre-pandemic. We've seen a decelerating migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interest-bearing book. Nevertheless, it's getting smaller every quarter. We would expect to see that really dissipating over the coming quarter or two and that's really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the Fed's on hold. So feeling very good about that trajectory. \nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Maybe, Brendan, do you track very carefully how we're doing versus peers and some of our strategies to continue to maintain that low-cost focus. So maybe you can add some additional color. \nBrendan Coughlin : Yes, sounds good. So much of our low-cost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed through the pandemic by all the stimulus. We saw the rundown of the stimulus rate peak in May, and it started to abate as we got into the summer and the fall, although it's still kind of spending down at a decent clip. We do have a lot of analytics, benchmarking analytics on how we're doing, and this is supportive of John's commentary that the franchise is performing in a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle.  We believe we're #2 in the peer set in terms of DDA consumer migration. So we're performing exceptionally well on the DDA side. And when you look at beta on the consumer side, as compared with the growth that we're getting, it appears for about 400 basis points to 500 basis points better in net growth on the consumer book through the cycle so far and our betas are mildly better. So more growth slightly better cost on the core book. That's excluding Citizens Access. That's a real indicator of the quality of franchise and the quality of the customer base that we've moved from sort of a community banking, high-priced deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships.  So we expect the pay down of low-cost deposits to continue to slow obviously, dependent on rate environment and the economy that potentially could change. What I do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to peers will be strong and we'll continue to outperform on the consumer side and the stability of our low-cost book. At the individual customer level, they still have a little bit more liquidity in their balances than they did pre-pandemic, that's largely held by affluent and high net worth individuals, our mass market book and even in the mass affluent space, they've sort of moderated back down to operating floors.  So I think those are all signs that would support the continued slowdown in the rundown of low-cost deposits pending any recessionary impact that may bring them below operating floors. So we feel pretty good. And just on the uninsured and insured deposit front, we saw a little bit of a blip on the uninsured in March. And since March, that has been incredibly stable and all parts of the book have been growing.  So all the fundamentals point to continued trajectory of stability and certainly continue to outperform. And then in addition to that, we're controlling what we can control is we're performing in the top quartile in the United States in terms of household acquisition growth. The New York market, as John pointed out, is helping to give us an extra lever to drive low-cost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends, which are generally out performing. So we do believe we've got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to continue to outperform in the medium-term outlook on low-cost deposits. \nPeter Winter : Very helpful. And then just one quick housekeeping. I just want to confirm, John, you said that the private -- the expense outlook for next year being flat. That includes the Private Bank build-out expenses? \nJohn Woods : Yes. The underlying expenses to be flat next year, including the Private Bank as well as Non-Core. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. \nKenneth Usdin : Just a follow-up on that last question. John, I just wanted to ask you, I know that the Private Bank buildout was $35 million of cost this quarter. Just wondering if there's any changes to your expectation of what that would trend like going forward as part of that cost commentary? \nJohn Woods: I think Brendan will probably have some color on this. So it's pretty similar into the fourth quarter. And then, of course, into next year, you see it starting to migrate towards a -- instead of being an EPS drag, it gets back to breakeven when you get out into 2024. And then more broadly, a 5% contribution to EPS is our outlook there. But... \nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. There'll be into Q4, some very modest upticks in the low 40s potentially. And the reasons for that, we hired the majority of the team as you all know, in the early part of the summer, the influences on that nudging up our successful securing of various different Private Banking offices coast-to-coast to house the team and start to bring in customers into the platform, some operating expenses clients come on board as well as we're playing some very selective second-tier office. There's still a lot of talent in motion and this quarter after the first 150. We also hired another 25 really top A-list talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer. And so we're going to be selective. But as we see the right talent pop up, we're going to grab them -- add them to the team. So... \nBruce Van Saun: The other thing, just in the way the comp is structured, Ken, that the folks who came over on guarantees as if they're fully producing. So as the revenues come in, there won't be incremental costs. They'll just be kind of earning those pay levels. So another factor to consider. \nKenneth Usdin : Yes, that's a great point. And then as a follow-up, you guys have done a great job over the years on the TOP program and just I take your commentary about holding costs flat, inclusive of these extra builds that would imply a real turn exiting the year given that you ramped through the year on cost this year. And John, I know you mentioned AI as a piece of that increment. But you've done 100 plus of TOP each year. I'm just wondering like where else would you be digging in across the organization to get that magnitude of what seems to be a pretty meaningful implied to extra cost save out of the numbers next year. \nBruce Van Saun: So it's Bruce. And let me start off and then John can amplify. But the TOP program, I think, has been a real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage. But to actually get to flat for next year, we have to go beyond that. So we've geared up a very nice TOP program and we're adding to it. But I think we're going to have to look at kind of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks and we'll look at certain business activities that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically.  We've already done some of that this year. So we downsized the mortgage business quite a bit. We exited the auto business. So I think it's a combination of actions. It's continuing to find ways to upsize TOP, leverage things like AI, where we can do that. look at our overall board structure and staffing levels and see if we can pinch some efficiencies there and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where the key years not to just have a knee-jerk revenues, there's revenue pressure in the environment. So let's really take a hard knife at all expenses. We have to be judicious about where we're cutting and protect the things that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term. So things like the private banks, things like the New York Metro expansion. There's things that we're going to ring fence and then there's other areas we're going to have to go a little harder with the knife. John? \nJohn Woods: Yes, I think that covered it well Bruce and just ongoing the fundamentals, our bread and butter of focusing on organizational related items and third-party spend and the like. And I won't repeat all the categories that Bruce articulated, but we've got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. \nManan Gosalia: You have 67% of deposits from consumer, so a strong franchise there. And you noted that you should outperform peers on a relative basis. But one of your large peers noted last week that banks may still be overearning on NII. So I guess my question was, how do you see competitive factors playing out for consumer deposits next year, especially if the rate environment stays higher for longer? \nBruce Van Saun: Brendan, do you want to? \nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. We certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits. You're seeing kind of money market and CD rates in the mid-5s in some spots. We feel like we're competing really, really well on that. Obviously, it's supported by our transformation on low cost, that's where you kind of start on how you manage strong NII levels and NIM levels as having a solid foundation of low-cost, highly engaged customers. We have probably more levers than others have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up coming our way in 2024.  Certainly, we have Citizens Access, which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to grow interest-bearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships, but also it helps not put too much contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may drive in hot money and bring the franchise into non-relationship-based banking. And so that's been an incredibly effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interest-bearing costs. We've also -- where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates. We've done it in an incredibly relationship-based way. So the access into -- no pun intended, with Citizen's Access, access into higher rates on deposits of your core banking customer of ours requires you to be in a relationship product. We call it Quest or a private client, which is our mass affluent or affluent value proposition. So when you do more with us, you get more, that strategy has enabled us to be more targeted in how we think about introducing interest-bearing costs into the environment that we're able to protect and retain balances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire book in some spots. So it's intense out there. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of hard to come by through the U.S. banking system, but we think we've got the right tools and the right levers to continue to win and compete well with our peers. \nJohn Woods: And just maybe just to add, that's all great points there. And then just to add one other point about this. I mean, the rate environment is not -- is expected to become more constructive, I guess, is the point. Meaning if you're raising deposits in a world where the yield curve is inverted or at best getting less inverted. That's always going to be a tricky situation for banks until it becomes a more stable upward sloping situation, which I think is more likely to be the case as you get into '24 and certainly to the end of '24, when you start seeing lower short-term rates and nevertheless, an attractive long-term rate where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive return. So that's really what I think is going to shake out as you get into '24. \nBruce Van Saun : I mean the other one last piece of color I would add is that as we enter 2024, we're still kind of having a net loan shrink, and that will eventually turn around as the Private Bank starts to put on loans, and we'll see where the economy is. But we won't really need to we're not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans. We can still see the LDR improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit. So factoring that into the calculus of do you really need to be aggressive given that's your dynamic around loans and deposits that helps you manage the cost of your deposit franchise. \nManan Gosalia : Great. I appreciate all the color there. And just separately on the LCR requirements, you mentioned that you're compliant in both Category 1 and Category 3 now and that this build is also NII neutral. But I guess the question is, how much more do you think you need to build from here? And how do you think about that increasing your asset sensitivity in the long run? \nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean I think we should say -- a couple of questions in there. I mean I think the regulatory requirements are generally inducing banks to become more asset sensitive. You got the issue of more broadly, if the long-term debt rule goes in, that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration, that's going to cause asset sensitivity to grow over time. We're naturally an asset-sensitive bank. And those forces would cause us to be more asset sensitive. So that will -- we'll have to consider in the coming and during the transition periods, whether it makes sense to moderate those positions with all balance sheet types of actions.  But nevertheless, there's generally a tailwind of asset sensitivity being created from the regulatory environment, but also idiosyncratic to us, our Non-Core portfolio as that runs off that's mostly a fixed book and that has a tailwind to asset sensitivity. We're around neutral now. So going becoming a bit more asset sensitivity over time is some of the underlying forces there that I would say are in place, and we'll decide as the environment plays out, whether how and whether to moderate that.  And again, the liquidity build is NII neutral. So it's really not a driver. And it's something that, again, at the NII guide of down 2% is really driven by basically having a -- the ex liquidity build NIM decline is really the driver of that and it equates to the 2% that you're seeing in the guide. So that's the way to pull it all together for 4Q. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Connor from Deutsche Bank. \nMatthew O'Connor : A lot of talk earlier in the call in terms of net interest income trajectory for next year and all the puts and takes. But I just wanted to circle back on that. In a stable rate environment to kind of higher for longer when and around what level does the interest income dollars start to bottom? \nJohn Woods: Yes, I mean we're still working through our 2024 outlook, right? So we're going to be much more, I would say, transparent about what our expectations are for '24 as you get into planning season here and completing that. And of course, we do that in January. With that said, we -- broadly, as you look at the swap trajectory for us into '24, we have a swap portfolio growing right around the time that the forwards would indicate the Fed would begin to cut. As a matter of fact, and as I mentioned earlier, there's -- you could actually see deviation around that. And we happen to have a view that that it's likely that it will actually come in a little lower than where the forwards have it coming in at the end of '24. So that will be a mitigant. And as I mentioned, the Non-Core rundown is a mitigant. And Private Bank as that grows is, of course, accretive. The other thing I'll mention, I mean, if you get the on '24 and you look at what's happening in the '25 through '27 timeframes, it's certainly more consistent with a more neutral Fed posture that would represent, regardless of what the transition is in '24, that would represent a significant tailwind getting into '25 through '27, as you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and NII.  And so working our way through '24, we get some really nice tailwinds. And that's just on the Acosta portfolio. We also have a locked in and baked in tailwind from the terminated swaps which run off, as you can see on our slide, in a significant way over '25 to '27. So I would call '24 a transition year while the Fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes hold with Non-Core and creates a lot of momentum as you look out into '25 and beyond. \nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I would just add a little color here, Matt, to you and Erika's question. I think Erika was looking for John to say, are you still holding a 3% in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year. I think the reluctance to draw a line in the sand on 3% is the amount of the liquidity build and that -- some of the cards from the regulators on new liquidity regulations aren't turned over yet. So just putting that aside, if you just say that's a bit of an unknown -- do we still have an ambition to have our exit rate at the end of '23 be roughly the exit rate at the end of '24. Yes, that would still be the ambition. We have to go through the work, as John said, to go through kind of the budget process for next year, but that's still where we'd be hoping to arrive. \nMatthew O'Connor : And then just in terms of the impact of rate cuts versus higher for longer scenario, what's -- what does hire for longer do versus the rate cuts? Because it sounds like you're still a little asset sensitive, but the roll-on of the swaps would obviously benefit from rate cuts, so what's the net impact if rates are stable versus what the forward curve has for next year? Is it better or worse? \nJohn Woods: Yes. I'd say that where we're positioned, we're right around neutral. A small increase in rates is actually positive to our platform. A large -- we tend to calculate this stuff using the 100 basis point and 200 basis point gradual rises, we're relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations, which you'll see disclosures on in our 10-Q. But when it comes to just another hike, or -- and those kinds of conversations, meaning we tend to -- in those environments continue to make money and have a positive impact to NII. The other -- so generally, the forward curve is favorable to us. I think we like the tracking of the forward curve. We start getting cuts at the end of '24 and that allows the continued front book, back book. We like the long end being more anchored a little higher. That helps, too, in terms of our originations on our fixed rate loan book. So again, and it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that, that's desirable. So the forward curve is, I think, constructive for us, plus or minus is fine. I think large moves either way is where we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds. But other than that, we're feeling -- we would feel okay with it. \nMatthew O'Connor : Okay. So to summarize, steeper is better as a good rule of thumb? \nJohn Woods: I'd say forward curve is better and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much. So having some cuts at a slow -- I mean in general, over the long term, banks do better we're maturity -- were maturity intermediary, when rate -- when we have an upward sloping yield curve. So the short rates are at 5.50. We think that it's more constructive to see short rates around 3.00 to 3.50 over the long term. We also think it's constructive to have a 10-year that's north of 4% in that same environment. So therefore, a gradual decline from 5.50 down to about 3.00 to 3.50 over the next two years, we think it's not only good for us, but good for the industry and allow us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve. And I think that, that's the environment where we would be performing in a very good way. That said, we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that. But that's the one that I would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. \nVivek Juneja : I guess I have a couple of clarifications given all the discussions going on. John, when you said -- let's start with expenses. You talked about underlying expenses to be flat next year. But then you also said that includes Private Bank and Non-Core. Non-Core is not included in the way you define underlying expenses. So are you saying both underlying, which is core and reported expenses are both going to be flat next year? \nJohn Woods: No, I'd say underlying expenses at the top of the house will be flat next year, '24 versus '23. Underlying includes Private Bank, it includes Non-Core overall CFG expenses will be flat in '24 versus '23. \nBruce Van Saun: Underlying does not exclude those things today, the back that includes those things. \nVivek Juneja : Okay. So I want all these definitions, everybody has a little difference, so it's important to clarify that. The second one, I guess, John, going back to the rate discussion, just to get my head wrapped around that. If I heard you right, just in response to Matt's question, is that small increase in rate is beneficial to NII. But then rate cuts is also positive. So I'm trying to reconcile how both scenarios are positive for you? \nJohn Woods: Yes, I can clarify that, Vivek. I mean a small increase in rates from here would drive some NII -- a small amount of NII and a small decline would be a small negative in terms of the small decline in NII, but they're both quite small which is why we're calling ourselves neutral. But just -- but from a positioning standpoint, it would be a small positive if rates rose from here and let's say, one additional hike for example. Let's say if the Fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in November or December, we'll see an NII contribution to that. A small cut goes the other way and also -- but not a significant decline if there was a cut.  Yes. And to be clear, that's -- and the difference here is what happens immediately, say, in the next quarter versus what happens over time. We are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to 3% to 3.5% over, call it, a quarterly period of time. We think that's very good as it gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book, back books continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next, call it, a year or two as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with Non-Core runoff, et cetera. So we would -- our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that we'll migrate to over the, call it, the '24 and early '25 period. \nVivek Juneja : And one more clarification -- that's helpful. On the expenses, Bruce, when you talk about stable for next year, what are you assuming for capital markets? Are you assuming capital markets revenues and therefore incentive comp goes up? Or are you just using current level? Any color on that? \nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Well, we haven't given the full guidance yet on '24, but there is a variable element of pay that if revenues go up in capital markets that pay would go up. That's probably the 1 area that has the rates tied to revenues across the bank. And we would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process. So we said we're targeting the flat expenses for next year, and we would incorporate our view on kind of where the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that. And then we'd have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank. \nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\nBruce Van Saun : Okay. Thanks again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter, referencing Slides 5 and 6. For the third quarter, we generated underlying net income of $448 million and EPS of $0.89, this includes the Private Bank start-up investment of $0.05 and a negative $0.14 impact from the Non-Core portfolio.  Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 12.5%. On Slide 5, you'll see that we provided a schedule separating out our Non-Core runoff portfolio and the start-up investment in our new Private Bank from our legacy core results, so you can see how those impact our performance. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underwriting ROTCE of 15.3%. Currently, the Private Bank startup investment is a drag to results, but relatively quickly, this will become increasingly accretive, 5% EPS benefit in 2025. Similarly, while Non-Core is currently a sizable drag to revenues, it will run off quickly, further bolstering our overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forward starting swaps.  Back to Slide 6. Total net interest income was down 4% linked quarter, and our margin was 3.03%, down 14 basis points, both in line with expectations. Deposits were up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing resilience of the franchise. We continued our balance sheet optimization efforts, further strengthening liquidity during the quarter given the uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations, increasing cash and securities by about $4 billion.  In addition, the Non-Core portfolio declined by $1.4 billion, ending the quarter at $12.3 billion. While we await clarity on new liquidity rules for Category 4 banks, it is worth pointing out that we currently exceed the current LCR requirements for both Category 1 and 3 banks. Our period-end LDR improved to 84%, while our credit metrics remained solid with net charge-offs of 40 basis points, stable linked quarter.  We recorded a provision for credit losses of $172 million and a reserve build of $19 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.55%, up from 1.52% at the end of the second quarter with the increase primarily directed to raising the General Office portfolio reserves from 8% in 2Q to 9.5% at the end of 3Q.  We repurchased $250 million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.4%, up from 10.3% in the second quarter. And our tangible book value per share decreased 3% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates.  Turning to Slide 7 on net interest income. Linked-quarter results were down 4% as expected, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 14 basis points to 3.03%. As you can see from the walk at the bottom of the slide, the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing, which includes mix shift from lower cost to higher interest-bearing categories, noninterest-bearing deposit migration as well as the mix impact of the liquidity build I mentioned earlier. These factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and rundown of the Non-Core portfolio.  Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 48% through 3Q and which has been rising in response to the rate cycle and competitive environment. Our deposit franchise has performed well with deposit betas generally in the back of peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral, down slightly versus the prior quarter.  Moving to Slide 8. Fees were down 3% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees, partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees. The Capital Markets fees outlook was positive early in September, but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up to the end of the month, we saw a number of M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter, resulting in lower linked quarter M&A advisory fees as well as lower bond underwriting. While we continue to see good strength in our deal pipeline, uncertainty continues around the timing of these deals closing given the level of market volatility.  Card fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower balance transfer fees. The increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher MSR valuation, the servicing P&L provides a diversifying benefit, which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production as higher mortgage rates weighed on lock volumes.  On Slide 9, we did well on expenses, keeping them broadly stable linked quarter, excluding the $35 million Private Bank start-up investment.  On Slide 10, average loans are down 2% and period end loans are down 1% linked quarter. The Non-Core portfolio runoff of $1.4 billion drove the overall decline, partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Period-end core loans are stable. Average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients look to deleverage given the environment and higher rates. We saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment.  Next, to Slide 11 and 12. We continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were up $530 million linked quarter, with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits broadly stable. Our interest bearing deposit costs were up 39 basis points, which translates to a 48% cumulative beta.  Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, and with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 70% insurers secured. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this rising rate environment. As rates rose in the third quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories with noninterest-bearing now representing about 22% of total deposits. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and we would expect the decline to moderate from here, although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and consumer behavior.  Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points stable linked quarter with a decrease in commercial, offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto, which normalized following a very low second quarter result. Non-accrual loans increased 9% linked quarter to 87 basis points of total loans, reflecting an increase in General Office. We feel the rate of increase in non-accruals is decelerating after a jump in Q2.  Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.55%, which is a 3 basis point increase from the second quarter, which reflects a reserve build of $19 million as well as the denominator effect from the rundown of the Non-Core portfolio. We increased our General Office coverage to 9.5% from 8% in the second quarter. You can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the General Office portfolio to $354 million this quarter, which represents coverage of 9.5% against the $3.7 billion portfolio. We have already taken $100 million in charge offs in this portfolio, which is about 2.5% of loans. In setting the General Office reserve, we are factoring in a very severe peak to trough decline in office values of about 68% with remaining 18% to 20% default rate and a loss severity of about 50%. So we feel the current coverage of 9.5% is very strong. It's worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our outlook would be manageable given our strong reserve and capital position.  We have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan by loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower specific elements to de-risk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. I should also note that about 99.2% of CRE General Office is in current pay status. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.4% as we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank regulators. We returned a total of $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We plan to maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size.  Turning to Slide 16 and 17. I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, so that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slide 16, we've included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving performance over the medium term. On the commercial side, we highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Although deal activity has been relatively muted recently, many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to deploy. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity given the right market conditions.  We have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor lead tables. And our new private bankers will significantly expand our sponsor relationships, and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when sponsor activity picks up. We also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payment space, and we've been investing in our Treasury Solutions business developing integrated payments platforms and expanding our client hedging capabilities.  On the consumer side, our entry into New York Metro is going very well with some early success attracting new customers to the bank and growing deposits about 9x faster than in our legacy branches, as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The build-out of the Private Bank is also going very well. These bankers have hit the ground running and have already brought in around $500 million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half of Q3. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston and places where we'd like to do more like Florida and California.  We plan to open a few Private Banking centers in these geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with our Clarfeld legacy Wealth business as the centerpiece of that effort.  Turning to Slide 17 on the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program, which is progressing well. The chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the Non-Core portfolio, which is comprised of our $9 billion shorter-duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $7.6 billion from where we are now to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025, and as this run found, we plan to redeploy the majority of cash paydowns to building core bank liquidity with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio.  The capital recaptured through reduction in Non-Core RWA will be reallocated to support the growth of the Private Bank. In summary, this strategy strengthens liquidity has already been a source of about $3 billion of term funding ABS issuance this year. It builds capital by reducing RWAs and it's accretive to NIM, EPS and ROTCE.  Next to our TOP program on the right side of the slide. Our latest program is well underway and on target to deliver a $115 million pretax run rate benefit by year-end. Our TOP programs are essential to improving returns over the medium term and we are ready to launch on top 9, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in third-party spend as well.  In light of pressure on revenue given the rate environment, we are targeting to keep 2024 underlying expenses flat. On the technology front, we have a very extensive agenda with a multiyear next-gen tech cloud migration, targeting the exit of all of our data centers by 2025 and the program to converge our core deposit system onto a cloud-based modern banking platform. We've come a long way in modernizing our platform since the IPO.  And on the ESG front, we recently announced a $50 billion sustainable finance target, which we plan to achieve by 2030 and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. And we are working diligently to help our clients prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy.  Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 18. Our outlook incorporates the Private Bank and assumes that the Federal rate steady through the end of the year. We expect NII to be down approximately 2% next quarter, given the impact from noninterest-bearing and low-cost deposits migrating to higher cost categories, albeit at a decelerating rate, more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields, Non-Core runoff and day count.  Based on the forward curve, we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of 2023 to be approximately 50% and to rise to a terminal level of low 50s percent before the first rate cut. Noninterest income is expected to be up 3% to 4% with a seasonal pickup in capital markets depending on the market environment. Noninterest expense should be broadly stable, which includes the Private Bank and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Net charge-offs are expected to rise to approximately mid-40s basis points as we continue to work through the General Office portfolio and expected further normalization. We feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level and the ACL level will continue to benefit from loan runoff.  Our CET1 is expected to increase to approximately 10.5%, with the opportunity to engage in a modest level of share repurchases, the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Beyond the 4Q '23 guidance, as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting flat 2024 underlying expenses. This includes the Private Bank on the Non-Core portfolio and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Also, we've included Slide 25 in the appendix on the swaps impact through 2027. We expect higher swap expense in 2024 to be partly offset by the benefit to NII from the Non-Core rundown.  Notably, the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over 2025 through 2027 as swaps run off and the Fed normalizes short rates. In addition, the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in '26 and 2027.  To wrap up, we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment. Importantly, we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized and if the environment becomes more challenging. Our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns.  With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Thanks, Erika. Maybe I'll take that a little bit in reverse order because it may help us with the jump off conversation. So we -- net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter. So we've talked about that at 3.03%. I think that the two big forces that I would talk about broadly as you look out into the fourth quarter, would be our basic ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out.  So I'd say that if you look at overall net interest margin, I'd say that we're going to see another, call it, mid-single-digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity build. And so that 3.03% kind of gets to close, it comes in right around that 3%. So that's kind of playing out the way we expected, notwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration, I'd say that, that's holding about where we think it should be. The other item, as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck is the fact that given the uncertainty and regulatory environment, we've endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way. That liquidity build is NII neutral. But it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin. And so you could see that being an impact in the fourth quarter, so it was a couple -- maybe 2 basis points or so in the third quarter. That could be maybe another, call it several basis points as you get into the fourth quarter. So you can see things playing out as we expect in the fourth quarter.  When you basically get to the 2024 dynamics, once you reset the table in the fourth quarter, the big puts and takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into -- it's flattish when you get in the first half of the year, but it rises in the second half of the year. It happens that as it relates to '24, that's about when the forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in. So I'd say that when you think about some of the mitigants to the outlook, with the swap portfolio, you're going to have potentially the Fed beginning to cut in the second half of 2024. You have the ongoing benefit of the Non-Core portfolio. You've got the growing accretive contributions from the Private Bank. And with long range being where they are, asset front book, back book is will contribute positively.  And then just the broader balance sheet optimization efforts that we're doing across the bank. I think are all the areas that I would highlight as nice mitigants to what we're seeing play out. Let's see where the rate environment plays out. I mean the forwards have it in 1 place. We have Bloomberg economist consensus are probably 50 basis points lower than where the forwards are. But I mean, Nevertheless, we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and, frankly, growing momentum as you exit 2024 on the net interest margin. Yes. I think in the fourth quarter, I'd say that we're all else equal we're getting around that 3% level, depending upon the impact of liquidity builds, which are NII neutral. That is that liquidity build piece that I would say, which is kind of sort of set that aside, just given where we are, it doesn't drive NII. So you're thinking about the net interest margin that drives NII, we're going to be in that neighborhood of 3% ex liquidity build. 4Q '23, yes, sorry, I need to make sure that was clear, all everything I was just saying was about in that last bit was that we're getting around that 3% level, give or take, at the -- in 4Q '23 ex liquidity build and the liquidity build is NII neutral. So if you're trying to think about where we're driving NII, it's around that plus or minus 3% level ex liquidity build. For 2023 and all the other forces that we talked about earlier, we're -- as you're going into '24, when I was ticking off the tailwinds from Non-Core, Private Bank, asset front book, back book and BSO, all of those are tailwinds into '24, which will be mitigants along with, let's see where the rate cuts actually start kicking in, in the second half of '24.  And we'll see where we exit 2024. But that's something we'll come back to you on in terms of adding more color in January as we typically do. And we'll assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that time. It will be lower. It just depends on the NII neutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate. So it's sort of -- it's -- I think it's useful to talk about an ex liquidity build, given the fact that that's the driver of NII, and there'll be possibly additional -- just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded, it will be -- that's flat to NII, but it will be a denominator effect that would take the NIM below that plus or minus 3% that I talked about before, but not an NII driver. Yes. I think that we were saying that we think that the Non-Core runoff will be a continued driver of sort of in the first half of -- in 4Q and the first half of '24, you'll see some declines in the loan portfolio. But in the second half of '24, we start seeing the Private Bank contributing as well as organic contribution starting to see loan growth such that year-over-year, we would have an expectation you'd see us starting to see loan growth in the second half of '24. Sure. Yes, I'll go and handle that. I mean, I'd say, first off, I mean, I think when you look at our performance from a deposit beta standpoint, we feel like we're basically in the pack with what you're seeing across the industry, which is a really positive results compared to where we were last cycle, which is part of the ongoing investments we've been making in primacy and product capabilities and delivering the entire bank for our customers. So we're really kind of pleased to see where we -- how things are playing out cycle to date.  That said, we still are -- and frankly, when you look at the overall metric of noninterest-bearing to overall deposits were around 22%. That's basically back to where we were pre-pandemic. We've seen a decelerating migration out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interest-bearing book. Nevertheless, it's getting smaller every quarter. We would expect to see that really dissipating over the coming quarter or two and that's really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the Fed's on hold. So feeling very good about that trajectory. Yes. The underlying expenses to be flat next year, including the Private Bank as well as Non-Core. I think Brendan will probably have some color on this. So it's pretty similar into the fourth quarter. And then, of course, into next year, you see it starting to migrate towards a -- instead of being an EPS drag, it gets back to breakeven when you get out into 2024. And then more broadly, a 5% contribution to EPS is our outlook there. But... Yes, I think that covered it well Bruce and just ongoing the fundamentals, our bread and butter of focusing on organizational related items and third-party spend and the like. And I won't repeat all the categories that Bruce articulated, but we've got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term. And just maybe just to add, that's all great points there. And then just to add one other point about this. I mean, the rate environment is not -- is expected to become more constructive, I guess, is the point. Meaning if you're raising deposits in a world where the yield curve is inverted or at best getting less inverted. That's always going to be a tricky situation for banks until it becomes a more stable upward sloping situation, which I think is more likely to be the case as you get into '24 and certainly to the end of '24, when you start seeing lower short-term rates and nevertheless, an attractive long-term rate where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive return. So that's really what I think is going to shake out as you get into '24. Yes. I mean I think we should say -- a couple of questions in there. I mean I think the regulatory requirements are generally inducing banks to become more asset sensitive. You got the issue of more broadly, if the long-term debt rule goes in, that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration, that's going to cause asset sensitivity to grow over time. We're naturally an asset-sensitive bank. And those forces would cause us to be more asset sensitive. So that will -- we'll have to consider in the coming and during the transition periods, whether it makes sense to moderate those positions with all balance sheet types of actions.  But nevertheless, there's generally a tailwind of asset sensitivity being created from the regulatory environment, but also idiosyncratic to us, our Non-Core portfolio as that runs off that's mostly a fixed book and that has a tailwind to asset sensitivity. We're around neutral now. So going becoming a bit more asset sensitivity over time is some of the underlying forces there that I would say are in place, and we'll decide as the environment plays out, whether how and whether to moderate that.  And again, the liquidity build is NII neutral. So it's really not a driver. And it's something that, again, at the NII guide of down 2% is really driven by basically having a -- the ex liquidity build NIM decline is really the driver of that and it equates to the 2% that you're seeing in the guide. So that's the way to pull it all together for 4Q. Yes, I mean we're still working through our 2024 outlook, right? So we're going to be much more, I would say, transparent about what our expectations are for '24 as you get into planning season here and completing that. And of course, we do that in January. With that said, we -- broadly, as you look at the swap trajectory for us into '24, we have a swap portfolio growing right around the time that the forwards would indicate the Fed would begin to cut. As a matter of fact, and as I mentioned earlier, there's -- you could actually see deviation around that. And we happen to have a view that that it's likely that it will actually come in a little lower than where the forwards have it coming in at the end of '24. So that will be a mitigant. And as I mentioned, the Non-Core rundown is a mitigant. And Private Bank as that grows is, of course, accretive. The other thing I'll mention, I mean, if you get the on '24 and you look at what's happening in the '25 through '27 timeframes, it's certainly more consistent with a more neutral Fed posture that would represent, regardless of what the transition is in '24, that would represent a significant tailwind getting into '25 through '27, as you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and NII.  And so working our way through '24, we get some really nice tailwinds. And that's just on the Acosta portfolio. We also have a locked in and baked in tailwind from the terminated swaps which run off, as you can see on our slide, in a significant way over '25 to '27. So I would call '24 a transition year while the Fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes hold with Non-Core and creates a lot of momentum as you look out into '25 and beyond. Yes. I'd say that where we're positioned, we're right around neutral. A small increase in rates is actually positive to our platform. A large -- we tend to calculate this stuff using the 100 basis point and 200 basis point gradual rises, we're relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations, which you'll see disclosures on in our 10-Q. But when it comes to just another hike, or -- and those kinds of conversations, meaning we tend to -- in those environments continue to make money and have a positive impact to NII. The other -- so generally, the forward curve is favorable to us. I think we like the tracking of the forward curve. We start getting cuts at the end of '24 and that allows the continued front book, back book. We like the long end being more anchored a little higher. That helps, too, in terms of our originations on our fixed rate loan book. So again, and it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that, that's desirable. So the forward curve is, I think, constructive for us, plus or minus is fine. I think large moves either way is where we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds. But other than that, we're feeling -- we would feel okay with it. I'd say forward curve is better and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much. So having some cuts at a slow -- I mean in general, over the long term, banks do better we're maturity -- were maturity intermediary, when rate -- when we have an upward sloping yield curve. So the short rates are at 5.50. We think that it's more constructive to see short rates around 3.00 to 3.50 over the long term. We also think it's constructive to have a 10-year that's north of 4% in that same environment. So therefore, a gradual decline from 5.50 down to about 3.00 to 3.50 over the next two years, we think it's not only good for us, but good for the industry and allow us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve. And I think that, that's the environment where we would be performing in a very good way. That said, we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that. But that's the one that I would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole. No, I'd say underlying expenses at the top of the house will be flat next year, '24 versus '23. Underlying includes Private Bank, it includes Non-Core overall CFG expenses will be flat in '24 versus '23. Yes, I can clarify that, Vivek. I mean a small increase in rates from here would drive some NII -- a small amount of NII and a small decline would be a small negative in terms of the small decline in NII, but they're both quite small which is why we're calling ourselves neutral. But just -- but from a positioning standpoint, it would be a small positive if rates rose from here and let's say, one additional hike for example. Let's say if the Fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in November or December, we'll see an NII contribution to that. A small cut goes the other way and also -- but not a significant decline if there was a cut.  Yes. And to be clear, that's -- and the difference here is what happens immediately, say, in the next quarter versus what happens over time. We are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to 3% to 3.5% over, call it, a quarterly period of time. We think that's very good as it gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book, back books continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next, call it, a year or two as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with Non-Core runoff, et cetera. So we would -- our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that we'll migrate to over the, call it, the '24 and early '25 period."

            "content": "So do you want me to take that, John? So, just in general, as I think -- there's a lot of focus on shared national credits. Actually, when we came through the exam this year, we had more upgrades than we had downgrades. So we didn't have any forced charge-offs in terms of our shared national credit book. We've been taking our participations down as part of our BSO exercise. We've there about 10 basis points -- 10% lower than they were a couple of quarters ago. I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credit. We treat participations or share of national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension. So one, it has to return people think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning. We go through the exact same process, whether we're participating or leading a transaction or a sole lender. And then also, we do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make, whether it be shared national credit extension or not. So our SNC book doesn't perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank. And actually, in some cases, it's larger credits, so they might perform marginally better than some of the middle market assets that we have on the book over time. Yes. And let me just pick up on that. Just in the last quarter, back to the loan growth question, we had about $900 million front book loan originations, offset by about $1.6 billion of BSO activity. So we're really churning the book towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that Bruce mentioned. And I think a lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing. We see people supporting their lead bank relationships and moving away from more speculative future opportunities."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through a challenging environment. Our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we grew our CET1 ratio to 10.4% near the top of peers, while still buying in $250 million in stock with Non-Core loan runoff of $1.4 billion and deposit growth of $500 million in the quarter, we lowered our spot loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% at quarter end. We focused on building up our liquidity even further, given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of travel, adding almost $4 billion to cash and securities.  We also built our ACL further to 1.55%, well above our pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of 1.3% and with our General Office reserve now at 9.5%. While the balance sheet has been a principal focus, we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, which should drive strong medium-term performance. Our Private Bank is being built out. We had a soft launch during the back half of Q3, and we brought in around $500 million in deposits and investments.  Full launch is scheduled over the next several weeks. We're executing well on our New York City Metro push, our deposit strategies, our TOP programs, our ESG initiatives and our payment strategy.  Our underlying EPS for the quarter missed the mark slightly at $0.89 as several capital markets deals slipped from Q3 to Q4, given late quarter market volatility. This was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third quarter of 2020, three years ago and prior to several acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital. The good news here is that the pipelines remain strong and we continue to maintain and grow our market share. NII expenses and credit costs all track to expectations.  We included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck, Page 5, which breaks out results for our legacy core business, our Private Bank start-up investment and the drag from Non-Core. Note the legacy core performance shows Q3 EPS of $1.08, NIM of 3.33% and ROTCE of 15.3%. The Private Bank should turn positive by mid-'24 and be nicely accretive in 2025 and Non-Core will dramatically run down over the next several quarters. This dynamic will help offset the drag from forward starting swaps and help propel results higher over time. Given the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates, we've initiated a zero-based review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in 2024. We'll report further on this on our January call when we give 2024 guidance.  For Q4, we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize. NII will decline, but by less than in the past 2 quarters. Fees should bounce back somewhat, though the extent is market dependent. Expenses and credit costs should be stable, and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan runoff. This has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like Citizens. Rest assured, we are working hard. We're navigating the current turbulence well, and we're taking the actions to position us well for the medium term.  And with that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John? Okay. Thank you, John. Greg, why don't we open it up for some Q&A. Yes. Maybe, Brendan, do you track very carefully how we're doing versus peers and some of our strategies to continue to maintain that low-cost focus. So maybe you can add some additional color. The other thing, just in the way the comp is structured, Ken, that the folks who came over on guarantees as if they're fully producing. So as the revenues come in, there won't be incremental costs. They'll just be kind of earning those pay levels. So another factor to consider. So it's Bruce. And let me start off and then John can amplify. But the TOP program, I think, has been a real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage. But to actually get to flat for next year, we have to go beyond that. So we've geared up a very nice TOP program and we're adding to it. But I think we're going to have to look at kind of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks and we'll look at certain business activities that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically.  We've already done some of that this year. So we downsized the mortgage business quite a bit. We exited the auto business. So I think it's a combination of actions. It's continuing to find ways to upsize TOP, leverage things like AI, where we can do that. look at our overall board structure and staffing levels and see if we can pinch some efficiencies there and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where the key years not to just have a knee-jerk revenues, there's revenue pressure in the environment. So let's really take a hard knife at all expenses. We have to be judicious about where we're cutting and protect the things that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term. So things like the private banks, things like the New York Metro expansion. There's things that we're going to ring fence and then there's other areas we're going to have to go a little harder with the knife. John? Brendan, do you want to? I mean the other one last piece of color I would add is that as we enter 2024, we're still kind of having a net loan shrink, and that will eventually turn around as the Private Bank starts to put on loans, and we'll see where the economy is. But we won't really need to we're not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans. We can still see the LDR improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit. So factoring that into the calculus of do you really need to be aggressive given that's your dynamic around loans and deposits that helps you manage the cost of your deposit franchise. Yes. I would just add a little color here, Matt, to you and Erika's question. I think Erika was looking for John to say, are you still holding a 3% in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year. I think the reluctance to draw a line in the sand on 3% is the amount of the liquidity build and that -- some of the cards from the regulators on new liquidity regulations aren't turned over yet. So just putting that aside, if you just say that's a bit of an unknown -- do we still have an ambition to have our exit rate at the end of '23 be roughly the exit rate at the end of '24. Yes, that would still be the ambition. We have to go through the work, as John said, to go through kind of the budget process for next year, but that's still where we'd be hoping to arrive. Underlying does not exclude those things today, the back that includes those things. Yes. Well, we haven't given the full guidance yet on '24, but there is a variable element of pay that if revenues go up in capital markets that pay would go up. That's probably the 1 area that has the rates tied to revenues across the bank. And we would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process. So we said we're targeting the flat expenses for next year, and we would incorporate our view on kind of where the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that. And then we'd have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank. Okay. Thanks again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes. And I think just as part of BSO, as Bruce said, as part of BSO in general, we're kind of looking at the total relationship returns. And if we went into credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and become a more important bank, that's not panning out. We're not getting the cross-sell we anticipated, then we're extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity. So I think you'll continue to see that trend. Yes, sounds good. So much of our low-cost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed through the pandemic by all the stimulus. We saw the rundown of the stimulus rate peak in May, and it started to abate as we got into the summer and the fall, although it's still kind of spending down at a decent clip. We do have a lot of analytics, benchmarking analytics on how we're doing, and this is supportive of John's commentary that the franchise is performing in a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle.  We believe we're #2 in the peer set in terms of DDA consumer migration. So we're performing exceptionally well on the DDA side. And when you look at beta on the consumer side, as compared with the growth that we're getting, it appears for about 400 basis points to 500 basis points better in net growth on the consumer book through the cycle so far and our betas are mildly better. So more growth slightly better cost on the core book. That's excluding Citizens Access. That's a real indicator of the quality of franchise and the quality of the customer base that we've moved from sort of a community banking, high-priced deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships.  So we expect the pay down of low-cost deposits to continue to slow obviously, dependent on rate environment and the economy that potentially could change. What I do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to peers will be strong and we'll continue to outperform on the consumer side and the stability of our low-cost book. At the individual customer level, they still have a little bit more liquidity in their balances than they did pre-pandemic, that's largely held by affluent and high net worth individuals, our mass market book and even in the mass affluent space, they've sort of moderated back down to operating floors.  So I think those are all signs that would support the continued slowdown in the rundown of low-cost deposits pending any recessionary impact that may bring them below operating floors. So we feel pretty good. And just on the uninsured and insured deposit front, we saw a little bit of a blip on the uninsured in March. And since March, that has been incredibly stable and all parts of the book have been growing.  So all the fundamentals point to continued trajectory of stability and certainly continue to outperform. And then in addition to that, we're controlling what we can control is we're performing in the top quartile in the United States in terms of household acquisition growth. The New York market, as John pointed out, is helping to give us an extra lever to drive low-cost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends, which are generally out performing. So we do believe we've got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to continue to outperform in the medium-term outlook on low-cost deposits. Yes. There'll be into Q4, some very modest upticks in the low 40s potentially. And the reasons for that, we hired the majority of the team as you all know, in the early part of the summer, the influences on that nudging up our successful securing of various different Private Banking offices coast-to-coast to house the team and start to bring in customers into the platform, some operating expenses clients come on board as well as we're playing some very selective second-tier office. There's still a lot of talent in motion and this quarter after the first 150. We also hired another 25 really top A-list talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer. And so we're going to be selective. But as we see the right talent pop up, we're going to grab them -- add them to the team. So... Yes. We certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits. You're seeing kind of money market and CD rates in the mid-5s in some spots. We feel like we're competing really, really well on that. Obviously, it's supported by our transformation on low cost, that's where you kind of start on how you manage strong NII levels and NIM levels as having a solid foundation of low-cost, highly engaged customers. We have probably more levers than others have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up coming our way in 2024.  Certainly, we have Citizens Access, which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to grow interest-bearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships, but also it helps not put too much contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may drive in hot money and bring the franchise into non-relationship-based banking. And so that's been an incredibly effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interest-bearing costs. We've also -- where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates. We've done it in an incredibly relationship-based way. So the access into -- no pun intended, with Citizen's Access, access into higher rates on deposits of your core banking customer of ours requires you to be in a relationship product. We call it Quest or a private client, which is our mass affluent or affluent value proposition. So when you do more with us, you get more, that strategy has enabled us to be more targeted in how we think about introducing interest-bearing costs into the environment that we're able to protect and retain balances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire book in some spots. So it's intense out there. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of hard to come by through the U.S. banking system, but we think we've got the right tools and the right levers to continue to win and compete well with our peers."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. And with that, I will hand over to you Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. The turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter, but we continue to navigate well and we delivered solid financial performance. In particular, we're pleased with the strong results we achieved around capital, liquidity and funding. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points to 10.3% in the quarter and we were able to repurchase in excess of $250 million in stock. We grew spot deposits by 3% or $5.5 billion and our spot loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 85%. Our federal home loan bank borrowings dropped by $7 billion to $5 billion and contingent liquidity grew by 20% to $79 billion. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.04 an ROTCE of 13.9%. NII was down 3% reflecting higher funding costs, in line with our expectations. Non-interest income grew 4%, slightly less than expected as capital markets saw a few deals pushed to the third quarter. The expenses were broadly stable as expected and credit cost continue to be manageable. One of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent, largely from the First Republic platform to meaningfully augment our Citizens Private Bank and Wealth Management business. While expense investments will lead revenues in 2023, we project the business to be accretive in 2024 and significantly profitable in the medium term. In our presentation this morning, we will highlight this initiative in more detail. And we'll also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong medium-term outperformance. Execution of these initiatives continues to be strong. We're setting up a non-core run-off portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect around $9 billion of loan run-off, largely in auto by the end of 2025. This capacity will be utilized to fund more strategic loan portfolios, to pay down high-cost debt, and to build cash and securities. In parallel, the Private Bank will grow loans over this period by $9 billion, which will be funded by $11 billion of incremental deposits. The net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital, along with the positive impact on earnings per share, ROTCE and liquidity. We've also included more detail on our CRE loan portfolio. Our general office reserve is now at 8%. While we continue to see increases in criticized assets and charge-offs in this particular portfolio, we believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we anticipate that the environment while stabilizing, will continue to be challenging. Our net interest margin will decline again in Q3, given higher funding costs. We expect our terminal beta to reach 49% to 50% at year end. Our fees to continue to grow sequentially. Expenses will be well-controlled and credit should be broadly stable. We will further build our CET1 ratio while continuing to repurchase shares. Overall, we're holding in okay on current-period performance with mid-teens ROTCE in 2023, while making the investments to deliver a stronger franchise, attractive growth and returns, and afforded by balance sheet over the medium-term. We continue to build a great bank and we remain very excited about our future. Our capital strength and our attractive franchise, position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the second quarter, referencing Slide 5. For the second quarter, we generated underlying net income of $531 million and EPS of $1.04. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13.9%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter, and our margin was 3.17%, down 13 basis points with funding costs outpacing the increase in asset yields. We delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of the franchise with spot deposits up 3% or $5.5 billion. Period-end loans and average loans were down 2% quarter-over quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, including our ongoing run-off of auto. These dynamics improved our period end LDR to 85% and our liquidity position remains very strong. We reduced FHLB borrowings by about $7 billion to approximately $5 billion outstanding at quarter-end and we increased our available liquidity by 19% to about $79 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total NCOs of 40 basis points are up 6 basis points linked-quarter as expected, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs, increased general office. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $176 million and a reserve build of $24 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.52% up from 1.47% at the end of the first quarter, with the increase directed to the general office portfolio. We repurchased $256 million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.3%, up from 10% in the first quarter. And our tangible book value per share is down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates. On the next few slides, I'll provide further details related to second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was down 3%, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 13 basis points to 3.17% with the increase in asset yields, more than offset by higher funding costs, given the competitive environment and migration from lower cost categories. With Fed funds increasing 500 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 42% through the second quarter which has been rising in response to the rate and competitive environment and is generally in the pack with peers. Our asset sensitivity at the end of the second quarter is still approximately 1% which is broadly stable with the prior quarter. Our received fixed cash flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter as we held off on adding further protection as rates continued to rise during the quarter. Moving on to Slide 7, we posted a solid fee performance in a challenging market environment. Fees were up 4% linked-quarter with card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes and increases in wealth and mortgage banking fees. FX and derivatives revenue was modestly lower. Capital markets fees were stable with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees, largely offset by increased syndications and M&A advisory fees, despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter. We continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half. Mortgage fees were slightly higher as production fees increased with market volumes, partially offset by lower margins and lower servicing fees. And finally, wealth fees were also up slightly reflecting growth in AUM. On Slide 8, expenses were broadly stable linked-quarter as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were offset by higher equipment and software costs, as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs. On Slide 9, average and period-end loans were both down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting balance sheet optimization actions in C&I, as well as the impact of planned auto runoff. Education was lower given the rate environment, but this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and from equity. Commercial utilization was down a bit as clients look to deleverage, given higher rates and we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment. On Slide 10, period-end deposits were up $5.5 billion or 3% linked-quarter with growth led by consumer up $3 billion and commercial up $2 billion. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 47 basis points, which translates to a 101% sequential beta and a 42% cumulative beta. Strong deposit flows and a very successful auto loan collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing FHLB levels by about $7 billion. Given our BSO objectives, we grew deposits, which drove a favorable mix-shift away from wholesale funding. As a result, our total cost of funds was relatively well-behaved up 38 basis points. Next, I'll move to Slide 11 to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise. With 67% of our deposits skewed toward consumer and highly-diversified across product mix and channels, we are able to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment. We increased the portion of our insured and secured deposits from 68% to 70% linked-quarter and when combined with our available liquidity of $79 billion, our available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about 150% from around 120% in the first quarter. As rates grew another 25 basis points in the second quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories, primarily in commercial with noninterest bearing now representing about 23% of the book. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and should stabilize from here. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw a good credit results in retail again this quarter and higher charge-offs in commercial. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points, up 6 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects an increase in the general office segment of commercial real-estate, partly offset by a slight improvement in retail, primarily due to the strength in used-car values. Nonperforming loans are 79 basis points of total loans, up 15 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting an increase in general office, which tends to be lumpy. It's also worth noting that overall delinquencies were lower sequentially with retail and commercial both improving slightly. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $24 million, which includes a $41 million increase in CRE general office, even after covering charge-offs of $56 million. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.52%, which is a 5 basis points increase in the second quarter. The runoff of the noncore portfolio primarily auto, facilitated the reallocation of reserves to CRE. The reserve coverage in general office was increased to a strong 8%. On Slide 14, you'll see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $313 million this quarter which represents coverage of 8%. In addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the general office portfolio, we continuously perform a detailed loan level analysis that takes into account property-specific details, such as location, building quality, operating performance and maturity. We have a very experienced CRE team more focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work-through the property and borrower-specific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. Our reserves reflect this detailed view of the portfolio as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page. The property value, default rate and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve, are adequate for the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what we've seen in previous CRE downturns. It's worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration behind what we expect would be very manageable, given our strong reserve and capital position. On the following Slide 15, there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail on the type and location of the general office portfolio. You can see out of the $3.9 billion general office portfolio, 94% is Class A or B with the majority in suburban areas, which seem to be performing better than central business districts. On the bottom left-hand side of the page, it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies, as well as the top 10 MSAs, listed on the bottom right-hand side. Broadly for New York MSA, we are starting to see return to office trends picking-up and more than 80% of the portfolio was outside Manhattan where property dynamics tend to be more favorable. Washington DC is 100% class A&D and 95% suburban. Moving to Slide 16, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as we look to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment. We returned a total of $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to Slide 17. You'll see that our CET1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group. This strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the IPO in maintaining robust capital levels. If you incorporate the removal of AOCI opt-out, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 0.5% and we also expect that this replace us near the top of our peer group again this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly 20 basis points of CET1 ratio post-dividend each quarter in 2H '23 before share buybacks. So, as you see, we've been focused for a while and playing really strong defense with a focus on capital, liquidity, funding and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite. And that's the job one. Even long before the turmoil we saw in the first quarter. But we also recognized the need to continue to play offense. We need to be selective, investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win. Over the next few slides, I'll spotlight a few of the exciting things we're doing and ensure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slides 19 and 20, we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we hired about 50 senior private bankers and 100 related support professionals who were with First Republic. As many of you know, for a number of years, we've had an interest in growing our wealth business, both organically and inorganically. So we made a number of investments on the organic side, hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a transactional business to a very customer-centric financial planning approach. That's been a slow and steady build over the years. And then we supplemented that with the Clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago and that's gone incredibly well. So, with our customer-centric culture, our financial strength and the full range of products and services we offer, we were the perfect fit for these bankers. We really admire their approach to delivering the bank to their customers in a unique way with white glove service. This is really a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more like, Florida and California. In fact, we think the overlap with JMP in San Francisco is extremely complementary. These bankers serve the types of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank, high and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families, often the strong connections to middle-market companies with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital firms, serving the innovation economy. We have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and ensure that they are positioned to deliver that bank to their clients. We plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with Clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort. We think this is going to be extremely attractive from a financial perspective. These teams and their staff, about 150 people in total, on-boarded late in the second quarter with revenue begin to ramp in the fourth quarter. Financial impact for the second half will be $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS plus an initial notable cost of about $0.03 for 2023. These bankers have hit the ground running and are out-working to build their book of business and we expect the effort to breakeven around the middle of 2024. By 2025, we expect EPS accretion of roughly 5% with 2025 year end projections of about $9 billion in loans, $11 billion of deposits and $10 billion of assets under management. So overall, a very exciting advance for us. Now let's go to Slide 21, and I'll walk you through how we'll be managing our balance sheet over the next few years. Since the IPO, we're prudently growing our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding with an eye towards maximizing returns. With the increase in rates since the end of 2021, plus the advent of quantitative tightening and more recently, the heightened competition for deposits, we are entering the next stage of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending, while lowering our LDR, which will improve our liquidity profile and benefit returns. In order to make this effort clear and show the benefits we expect, we've established a $14 billion non-core portfolio which is comprised of our $10 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship purchased customer loans - consumer loans. This portfolio will run down fairly quickly with about $9 billion of run-off expected by the end of 2025. Moving to Slides 22 and 23, you'll see that as the non-core loan portfolio runs down, this allows us to pay down higher-cost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio. We will also be growing relationship-based lending to the private bank and raising deposits to self-fund that growth. Despite the size of the run-off portfolio, we expect to see modest loan growth in 2024, picking up in 2025, driven by opportunities across retail and C&I as well as our private bank effort. The net result of these actions is an improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix and higher returns. Next on Slide 24, a quick update on our entry into New York Metro where some really exciting things are happening. With the branch conversions behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities. We continue to be encouraged by our early success. We've seen strong sales in the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in their network. Most importantly, we have seen a steady improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. On the commercial banking side, we've got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from larger firms and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines with middle-market firms. And we are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the market. On Slide 25, we have a great opportunity to build on Citizens Access, our national digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We moved to a modern fully cloud-based core platform and we are trying to add checking capabilities later this year. Down the road, we plan to converge our legacy core system with this modern platform. We are confident that a single integrated platform will be more cost-efficient and flexible in meeting our client's needs. We aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass-affluent market segment. And on the right side of the page is CitizensPay where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. CitizensPay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank with very high promoter scores and this has been a great performer from a credit perspective. We have some fantastic partners on the platform for a while, such as Apple, Microsoft, Best Buy, BJ's and Vivint. And we are always very excited to welcome new partners like Peloton, Tre, The Tile Shop and Wisetack to platform. On Slide 26, I'll highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Over the last several years, private capital fundraising had led - has led to record deal formation, M&A activity and substantial fees. The activity has been relatively muted recently and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity. We have been executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor lead tables, particularly in the middle market. We have made significant investments in talent and capabilities, including five advisory acquisitions since 2017. And our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities. Our success supporting private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years and we are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer. Let's move to Slide 27 for an update on our TOP program. Our latest TOP 8 program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have decided to augment the program to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We have increased our targeted benefit by $15 million to $115 million by accelerating some of our other efforts and to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs. We have also begun planning for our TOP 9 program, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in procurement. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and I'm very confident that we'll continue to deliver these benefits to the bank. Moving to Slide 28, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter for Citizens, which excludes the impact of the Private Bank and I will also provide some comments for the full year. The outlook takes into account another rate increase, followed by Fed on hold for the remainder of this year. For the third quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 4%. Noninterest income to be up by approximately 3%. Net interest expense should be broadly stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly. Our CET1 is expected to rise modestly from 10.3% with additional share repurchases planned, which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Relating to the full year, our liquidity position is quite strong and given the BSO actions I discussed earlier, we will continue to build on this, targeting an LDR of low-to mid-80s by the end of the year, positioning us well for anticipated regulatory changes. Worth noting we are already - we already are fully LDR compliant with Category 3 bank requirements. Based on the forward curve, we are expecting a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta of 49% to 50%. Our net interest margin should begin to stabilize in Q4 as the Fed is expected to reach the end of the rate hike cycle. We are off to a great start of drilling up the private bank, and we expect the EPS impact of this to be $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.02 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter. So we really think of this as a capital investment. To wrap up, our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to navigate a turbulent external environment. We are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead. Our balance sheet strength also positions us very well to focus on our strategic priorities to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive returns. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Van Saun, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the conference call. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is just on the sort of accretion to the margin from the balance sheet optimization. Do you have a sense for what sort of steady-state margin from Citizens might look like after that is completed. I guess, it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific number, but just in your view how powerful is that accretion from these activities? And I appreciate that sort of the backdrop of the 4.2% yield versus the 5.5% funding costs.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think, broadly, we're seeing the impact of the rate environment on our net interest margin. We're managing it quite well as the Fed is continuing on its hiking cycle. And as you get into the end of the year, taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization activities, we see NIM flattening out and kind of holding it around 3% or so, as you get to the end of the year. The tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful and will continue to build into '24 and so those are the big drivers there, I think that also contributing to that NIM stability would be the fact that we think that balance sheet migration is starting to stabilize. And also you can ignore the fact that the Private Bank itself as you get out into '24, would start to deliver accretive NIM. So we're feeling good about the profile after we get through this last hikes from the Fed here in July, watching that NIM starts to stabilize as you get into the end of the year.\nScott Siefers: Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then is it possible to put sort of a finer point on the, I guess 8% to 10% - pardon me, $0.08 to $0.10 of cumulative expected EPS drag from the Private Bank initiatives. Certainly appreciate the sort of the loan and deposit in asset management or assets under management outlooks, but maybe any broad sense dollar value of expected revenues and expenses as we look into the second half.\nJohn Woods: Yes. And it's a little bit front-end loaded as the expenses will come in and drive probably more in the neighborhood of $0.06 of that $0.08 to $0.10 happening in third quarter with $0.02 to $0.04 really into the fourth quarter. And it's primarily expenses in the neighborhood of $40 million or so, as you get into the 3Q and 4Q and but the loan book starts to build later this quarter and into 4Q. So that gives you the front-end loaded of that $0.08 to $0.10 into 3Q.\nBruce Van Saun: The one thing I would say to that, Scott, it's Bruce, is, this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth business. We've been looking for acquisition ideas and it's been very expensive with very long tangible book value earn backs, many times would be over five years, which is beyond our appetite. So to actually do this in a kind of de novo build-up basis, you incur some capital expense in the short run, but it's almost the same as if you kind of equate it to an outlays that ultimately starts to generate revenues. And the nice thing about this is that it's accretive already in the second year and kind of earn-back on this thing is under two years. So we look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the near-term EPS. But look, there is a capital outlay, which we burn some expense dollars to get it off the ground and then all of a sudden, it's making us money and it really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a 5% accretion in 2025, which is kind of within 2.5 years, in the second year of doing a deal If you compare that to some of the other transactions that we've done, including the bank acquisitions, it's pretty darn powerful. So very excited about this opportunity.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. John, I was just wondering if you can help us with lots of moving pieces that's sort of unfurling in front of us. So, just I guess, the first question is, you noted stability in the 3% - at the 3% level. Does that mean that fourth quarter 2024 will be at about the third quarter level? I'm just wondering sort of how those dynamics play out in terms of what you expect to the - how the balance sheet trend for the rest of the year or those sort of the run-off continue to pressure it at that level and what does that fourth quarter NII about look like from a range perspective.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, I think from the NIM standpoint, you're talking about '23, just confirming, Erika, is that - \nErika Najarian: '23. And building out of '24 fund.\nJohn Woods: Yes, no, you referenced '24. But the answer is actually a little bit similar, but what we do see is, after the Fed hikes here in July and that the impact of that burns in in the third quarter that we do see NIM flattening out there between 3Q and 4Q, having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year around 3%. So maybe a touch higher in 3Q net interest margin, but seeing that profile begin to flatten out and I think the key drivers of that, the pieces in parts as I mentioned, we're starting to see the deceleration in deposit migration, the negative deposit migration. So that's a good early green shoot, that's consistent with the fact that our DDA levels are basically where we were back to pre-pandemic. And so that ends up being at an expected landing zone as you get into the end-of-the year. So we'll see that flattening out. You'll see the tailwinds from this - from the runoff block starting to kick in, the reallocation of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending and the ability to pay-down some higher-cost funding as you get into the end of the year. And so that starts to bolster net interest margin, which we do think carries into '24, and we think that there are a number of positive developments in '24 that would allow us to hold that NIM out into even beyond the fourth quarter.\nBruce Van Saun: And I would comment, Erika, that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where we wanted to get the Fed - the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings lower and really take a big step in lowering the LVR. And so we paid up a little bit to achieve that and the impact of that full quarter effects the third quarter guide, but I think at this point, we feel that we don't need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits. We can have a more stable deposit profile. As John indicated, less migration from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing and so there won't be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects Q4 from Q3, because we'll be kind of looking at a more stable profile in Q3.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And so, thank you for that, Bruce. So, as I think about the fourth quarter, is it fair then to say that your guidance implies NII of $1.52 billion for the third quarter, so do we assume that we're at or around that range for the fourth quarter and as we think about the puts and takes of 2024 and John, I have to bring this up because few investors were noting - I think now at Slide 31, where you have some swaps rolling-off that have very heavy weighted-average fixed rate that you're receiving. So as I think about $1.52 billion perhaps is a starting point plus or minus, I assume that the - your guide were down 100 basis points. NII for the full year down 1.2%, it's still valid if we assume rate cuts next year and includes those swap roll-off. So that's sort of the first question. And the second is, how does balance sheet optimization impact that sensitivity? So I'm assuming that's extraordinarily static. So - and I'm assuming that's from - both sides are paying off more debt next year as you were waiting for these loans to come on and then - as you wait for these loans, you're also putting it in higher-yielding in cash. So, if you could just help us think through the moving pieces as it relates to that original disclosure because I think investors are thinking about the potential for rate cuts next year.\nJohn Woods: Yes. Maybe I'll just start off in a couple of areas. Just when you think about NII, similar numbers that you're throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we will see them come out. I think our NII be a little better than that and into fourth quarter, I think we have some opportunities to - if interest earning assets are going to be stabilized, as Bruce indicated and net interest margin stabilized, so we think the NII has also stabilized at that solid levels. So that was I think the first question that you had. I mean I think the - \nBruce Van Saun: Just to put a point on that too is, any swap impacts are in our forward guide, Erika. So we've already contemplated that. So there's nothing and they didn't really move. We didn't do any adjustments in the second quarter, so.\nJohn Woods: Yes, there is a very limited adjustments. Things do roll-off and come on, but broadly, our asset sensitivity profile was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, meaning we are - we were still asset sensitive. So a rate rise, which we're about to get from the Fed does actually contribute to NII and net interest margin for us. So from that perspective, all of that has been built into the commentary that we've been giving you in terms of swap roll-off and our ongoing positive asset sensitivity. Again, when you get - when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters, we have a number of tailwinds. You've got flattening out non-interest-bearing migration. So that's no longer expected to be a big headwind. You've got the run-off book that we talked about and that runoff book is going to be rotated into relationship lending at higher yields. So the runoff - \nBruce Van Saun: Paying off high-cost debt.\nJohn Woods: And paying down high cost funding, right, so which - where we have a negative kind of spread situation there. We already mentioned the fact that the Private Bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year and that the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank. I think, throughout there is that, just front book back book dynamics, where you basically have originations in the front book. Just in the securities portfolio alone, there's 300 basis points positive front book, back book in terms of - we're actually creating a bigger security stock, but we're doing at the right time where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable. And so we're putting a lot of way from that standpoint. And we're seeing back into the loan book, spreads on our front book originations are higher than they were. And for example in C&I, spreads are up 50 basis points over the last year, year-over-year. So that's also a tailwind and all those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that - manage the rate environment and the other items that we have -- \nBruce Van Saun: So I think what John described, Erika, is a number of tailwinds that should be positive. So if the Fed is cutting next year, that potentially is a negative, but we have these positive things to offset that, which gives us kind of that stable view on the NIM into '24.\nErika Najarian: Got it. And just to wrap it up, just because I got a few emails to clarify and I'll step aside. It sounds like you're sensitivity hasn't changed or whatever that fourth quarter number is, which is stable to the third quarter, that down 1.2% on down 100 is still valid, but then the balance sheet optimization will get you closer to stable despite Fed cuts.\nJohn Woods: Yes, agree. So balance sheet optimization plus the fact that when if rates were - rates begin to fall, if they do, we don't have that happening in the fourth quarter by the way. We have that happening in '24. We have the Fed on-hold for the rest of the year and we have the Fed just based on the forward curve, right, having the Fed ending around 4% in '24. So it's really until '24, where you see those down rate scenarios. And in the down rate scenario, I mean, that's where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you. And so, then you start getting some of that coming in as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when rates start to fall and so I would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds I already articulated as to why we feel like we could hold the stable NIM.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, I'll just close and you got an extended period of time here, Erika, and we're very interested in NII and NIM, which I'm sure is on a lot of investors' minds. But, kind of bigger picture is, we're kind of transitioning the loan book to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital and better opportunities for cross-selling deepening with customers. And so we're kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next year. It's a little hard to give you full guidance at this point, given a lot of uncertainty still in the market. We're giving you our best instincts at this point on that. But I feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through '24 and then even look out to '25, that - kind of, with the lift-off of this Private Bank effort and the kind of run-down of these less strategic portfolios that we're going to get a lot of benefit from this and we're really poised to do quite well, I think looking out into kind of back-half of '24 into '25.\nErika Najarian: Yes, Bruce that Private Bank lift-out is a bold move. I think everybody just wanted to figure out what that run rate look like and I think this conversation we just had, clarified that run rate. So, thank you.\nBruce Van Saun: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nNathan Stein: Hi, good morning. This is Nate Stein on behalf of Matt O'Connor. Just one question from me. So the capital build was good this quarter with the CET1 rising to 10.3% from 10% and guidance calls for this increase again in 3Q. Just wanted to ask how high are you willing to let the ratio get to?\nBruce Van Saun: I think - it's Bruce. I think, by the end of the year, we could see it getting to 10.5% which is a bit above our stated range have been 9.5% to 10%. I think given all the uncertainty that's out there in the economy plus direction of travel from regulators, that managing it up like that is sensible. Having said that, we're still generating quite good returns, which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio, but also repurchase our stock, which we think is great value at the current pricing. So that's how we're looking at it. And then, as we go through 2024 at this point, our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same that we can at least hold that 10.5% and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators. But we have the wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further.\nNathan Stein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy: Bruce and John, can you guys share with us, obviously, Vice Chair Barr came out with a speech last week talking about RWA increases that will lead to higher capital levels for all banks over $100 billion in assets. Have you guys given some thought on where this could be - where you could be most impacted by the new Basel 3 Endgame that maybe will come out next week. And then second, as part of this, this week Bloomberg reported that there may even be some RWA increases for residential mortgages which really hasn't been discussed. And how are you guys approaching, what could be coming possibly as soon as next week?\nBruce Van Saun: Let me start up. Quickly flip it to John. But, clearly, I would say there's mixed views on whether that's - sound proposal at this point and I think the industry itself - liquidity itself very well through the pandemic, through this period of turmoil in the first half of the year and I think many folks have commented that the industry has strong capital and so in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures, is it appropriate that the thing that needs to be fixed is more capital in the banking system.  I don't know. I question whether that's appropriate, and we'll see how it plays out. I think there'll be lots of dialogue around that. I think from our standpoint, by moving our capital position higher, we're anticipating any of what could come down the pike is something that we can absorb. We're in a very strong position relative to our SCB, which, by the way, we still have some questions about how it landed where it did but nonetheless we're well above that. And we're well above if the AOCI filter goes away, we already have sufficient capital to meet our new propose SCB. So we're in a position of strength, Gerard. I think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as we get through this transition period and hit our medium-term financial targets. But I would kind of at least comment that I'm not sure that that's the answer when we had a series of management supervisory failures and poor asset liability management. That really was the problem that caused this term off, not a lack of capital in the banking system. So I'll get off my soapbox and I'll pass it over to John.\nJohnWoods: Yes, I agree with all of that. And I think the issue is in credit RWA versus operational risk RWA, Gerard. So, I think there was the view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk RWA and maybe it wouldn't be much of an increase expected at the regional bank level, but I did see - we did see those reports on residential mortgages. We'll see how it all plays out. But on the operational risk side of things, with a complex fee-based sort of businesses are where a lot of that is directed and it's not just - we don't have much of exposure - as much of exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry do. So broadly we felt like that we would be impacted possibly a little less than most and we're sitting with capital a little more than most. So from that perspective, we feel pretty well-positioned for the uncertainty of the regulatory. We are making process and as you heard from Bruce, we're growing capital into the end of the year and I think a 10 - something in the neighborhood of 10.5% CET1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come down the road from the Fed.\nGerard Cassidy: Great, thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Hi, thanks, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the strategic remixing and wondering, can you give us some color on the types of loans and deposits that you think will come over as part of that - those new hires in the Private Bank. I mean, obviously, the First Republic mix have been kind of low-rate mortgages and high-rate CDs. I would expect that not the type of NIM you're looking to be adding. So just wondering just - what those producers you are expecting to bring over and also kind of we could see it in your AUM expectation, but it looks like it will be more NII delivering as opposed to fees.\nBruce Van Saun: Turn that over to Brendan.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, so, we are really excited obviously about this initiative and it's a very strategic acceleration of our Wealth Management business. But to your point, it does come with scaling up the bank as well while we are aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models. We're going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive at the top of the house. So what you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that while will be competitive, we're not going to kind of lead with undercutting the market and pricing to make sure we have the right margin. We will have an incredibly disciplined credit appetite. We don't expect to take a step forward or step in the wrong direction in terms of credit risk profile. In fact, we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low-risk loan generation. We are going to ensure that we're driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the Private Bank that we're getting core operating deposits, whether that's from individuals or from businesses. It's really important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth. And lastly, from a compensation perspective, we're going to rationalize the compensation model the best we can within the confines of a private bank to ensure that those - the combination of those factors give us a return profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall ROE, but also on things like NIM. So the balance sheet on the deposit side, certainly we have the mix of cash management operating deposits as well as interest-bearing. But we are going to heather all relationships to being primary banking, whether it's corporate or whether it's personal. So you could expect low cost DDA to be mixed in with interest-bearing for a healthy profile primary banking relationships. On the asset side, I'd say we're expecting about a 50/50 mix, what I would call sort of consumer personal retail lending and small-business and corporate lending. And on the personal lending side, really the large asset classes are going to be mortgage, home equity, and eventually partner loan program, where we are putting capital to individuals to engage as a partner and a higher-end consulting firm or private-equity firm, very traditional low-risk assets. But this lodges the operating deposits and ultimately lead you to AUM. And on the business side, as mentioned earlier, the profile of the team we got over, does have a bent towards the innovation economy. So we're expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships with private equity and venture. And small segment where it's appropriate relationship-wise on potentially multifamily in a very-high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship. All of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full end-to-end customer relationships that include deposits and ultimately AUM growth. So it's a very integrated end-to-end business model and we feel like we've got the right recreation of the service strategy, married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get better profitability and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of time. If that - we think we can get a really good growth around this, but we will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul.\nKen Usdin: Great color. Thank you, Brendan. And just one more question on the other side of the BSO. John, obviously talking a lot about the consumer side of the non-core portfolio here. Can you just dig and just let us know, you previously had done a lot on the commercial portfolio. And I'm just wondering, have you done any key currently deep diving into the CRE book, as you've talked about on the credit side. What might there still be to do on the commercial side of the portfolio in terms of BSO from that perspective. Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, I think, and as you know in this portfolio that we set up, that's - it's entirely a retail portfolio in terms of that $14 billion, but there are nevertheless in parallel BSO activity is continuing in the commercial side, and let Don talk about that.\nDonMcCree: Yes, so we've been at this for probably three or four years now as we just grown out relationships where we haven't been able to achieve across all that we've thought we have been achieved when we were going into the credit, several years ago. So it's really an ongoing effort. It's been running about $1 billion a year, and we probably will be running about that same pace. The good news is we've been able to replace some of that with growth in places like New York Metro, where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis, particularly in the middle market, as we bring on these new hires. On the CRE side, as everybody knows, there is not a lot of liquidity, but there is some liquidity and we're actually moving some of our exposures after the agencies and then do some private capital also. So we'll try to liquefy CRE, particularly multifamily over the next couple of quarters, couple of years to the best we can bring those overall exposures down, even though they're performing pretty well.\nKen Usdin: Good. Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. Just on the capital side, I heard you in terms of the CET1 trajectory from here, and that it does still allow for some repurchases. Maybe could you help us frame out what's a reasonable pace of buybacks we should assume which is similar to $250 million that you did this quarter?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say that is something we felt comfortable with in Q3. We were going through the Q2. We were going through the CCAR process at the time, but we saw the opportunity to build kind of have our cake and needed to build the ratio while also repurchasing shares and I think we'll still be in that position. So we still have noncore kind of rundown working for us, which is releasing RWAs. So you should again have a chance to somewhat - have your cake and needed to both in Q3 and Q4.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, thank you, Bruce. And then on the non-interest bearing mix stabilizing at the 23% near the 2Q level. Now what gives you confidence in the stabilization? I know you mentioned that you're not pushing as aggressively. You don't see the need to now on competition on pricing, is there anything that will beyond that in terms of depositor behavior that you're beginning to see that gives you that confidence that this is where it's bottoming?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I think there's two items that we look at. One is just the - as we are getting back to the historical place that the platform generated noninterest-bearing pre-pandemic, and so that's been sort of a foundational spot that we think creates some solidify of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer. So that's one really important spot. So around that 23% level is about how we see it. And then the second item is that, in the second quarter, we started to see some deceleration for the first time in several quarters. We started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating. And then we have a number of, I would say activities on the product and low-cost strategy front that we're seeing some really positive uptick on in retail, in particular, and so - \nBruce Van Saun: Let's ask Brendan to pick up and add some color.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, couple of quick points, just a quick recall, as we've talked over the last bunch of quarters. The consumer portfolio has been under a five-six year transformation for quite some time and it's in a very, very different starting points through the beginning of the cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in things like customer primary - primacy growth and households, or mass-affluent mix has improved and low-cost deposit profile has moved up. So coming into the cycle, we were very confident that we'd be more pure like or maybe outperform and data that we're seeing with benchmarking suggested in the consumer bank, we are indeed better-than-average versus peers right now on all the mentions interest-bearing cost, beta, as well as low-cost control. So we feel pretty good how we're performing against peers, it is starting to stabilize. So the excess surge deposits have burned down maybe by about 60%, so there's still a little bit out there. But a lot of those are starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation. If you dissect the various different segments, the wealthier segment is still having some modest outflows of rotation into interest-bearing as well as rotation outside of the banking industry. So year-over-year the wealthier segment is down about 10%. We're seeing the mass-affluent segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat and the mass-market portfolio has actually increased in net deposits and that's a function of a lot of our strategies that we put in place to really drive primacy and activity and engagement. And so we've seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of DDA balances. What we have done to drive that is a lot of product innovation. So we did things like get your paycheck two days early. It doesn't seem like a big deal, it's actually an incredibly big deal. That's driving a lot of primary banking behavior. We've got technology we put in place that when you open a new DDA, you're automatically porting over your direct deposit that seems very operationally oriented. But it actually is a dramatic improvement that things like primary banking behavior which drives low-cost deposits. We've made overdraft perform through our Peace of Mind 24-Hour Grace program and a variety of other things, which has also driven a lot of primacy and we're starting to really rev up the engines on household growth. Overall, all of those things contribute to some controllable. So we're - I think we're outperforming peers on the market, given our starting point in the cycle and we're continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these different initiatives and strategies. It is the long game. These are driving primacy in low-cost deposits. It takes a while to build up scale, but I feel like we've got a lot of the right things in place in addition to outperforming on our back-book to win the game uncontrollable where we're at right now.\nJohn Pancari: So, well, your two-thirds of the deposit base and have all these great strategies you have done. You've also been investing in payments capabilities and some new products like sustainable deposits. Maybe you could just offer a brief comment.\nDon McCree: Yes, that's right. I mean, we've been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely and as Bruce said, it's a combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall and bringing on more clients on the cash management side. As I said, in New York Metro, the things that we're adding are really full wallet for cash management relationships and those bring really nice deposits. And then on the product side, we've done a lot around green deposits and carbon offsets deposits in our ESG strategy that was approved to be quite profitable. We've built out escrow products and bankruptcy products. So there's a variety of product development things which are attracting nice operating deposits with some nice breadth for them.\nBruce Van Saun: Right. Thank you.\nJohn Pancari: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\nManan Gosalia: Hi, good morning, I appreciate all the detail on the office book. It looks like you have a pretty conservative assumption baked into your CRE office reserve levels of 8%. What - I guess the question is, what would you need to see to take that up even more. Or over the next few quarters, as some of your office portfolio comes up for renewal, should we expect the reserve levels go down as you have more normalized NCOs in that portfolio?\nBruce Van Saun: Let me start. And John or Don can add. But we feel quite good about A), the overall nature of what we have, and B) then - so there's good diversification, good quality characteristics. We have some really good people that are really focused hard on this and they are monitoring this loan-by-loan. They see the upcoming maturities to get way in front of those. So we're having good dialog with borrowers. And I'd say, we did a good job - relatively good job in the first half of absorbing some of maturities. Probably about 30 loans, I think came up for maturity, which is about the number that we're going to have in the second half and it's about the number that we're going to have in the first half of next year. It's about the number that we're going to have in the fourth quarter and next year. And if you look at the net result of that, while we have an increase in criticized, we have an increase this quarter was a little lumpy in NPAs in this sector and that probably levels off. I'd say, we were able to build our reserve and absorb charge-offs. So we took $56 million in charge-offs. So that's another kind of 1.5% loss content. If you look at the 8%, it's effectively higher while what we just absorbed. And so, could we go for another few quarters with absorbing charge-offs on a pay-as-you-go basis with what we're providing and hold the reserve flat? Yes, possibly, that could happen. And then at some point, does that tip over and then you don't need as much reserves because you burned some of those losses through your charge-off line. So anybody, that's just a little color about how we think about it, John. I don't know if you want to add anything to go direct to Don.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I'll just reiterate the fact that, as you mentioned, we took $56 million, that's a 1.5%. So that - we've got 8.5% - we got 8% set-aside, so that implies a 9.5% coverage for the losses through the cycle and we think that's pretty darn adequate, matter of fact, very strong. And so, I think that - as you also mentioned NPLs flattening out and charge-offs kind of getting in the run-rate rather than step-change from here which I think is important to reemphasize. And maybe just turn it over to Don.\nDon McCree: I think you guys have said it was 26 loans, so you're pretty close to the 30. That's pretty good that you know that. But I think the thing I'd emphasize is we've literally gone through every single loan one by one. Everyone is different. It's property-specific, it's MSA-specific, it's rental-specific, its sponsor-specific. And we're just seeing - we're starting to see outcomes. And outcomes are a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor. You might have a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry, and you might charge it off. So - and I think that we have a pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward. And things could always change, but I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've been very conservative based on what we see. And I will emphasize, I mean, we're not originating anything really of any scale and origination. So our whole origination team, in addition to our credit team, in addition to our work path team, is focused on working with our sponsors to basically - \nBruce Van Saun: In the office sector.\nDon McCree: In the office sector, yes. And the rest - by the way, the rest of the real estate, both multifamily and industrial data centers, I think, it looks like it's holding up extremely well. We're really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of those slip up.\nManan Gosalia: That's very helpful. Thanks for the fulsome answer. Just to move on to capital. Is there any color you can share on what drove the increase in the stress capital buffer this year? I know that mortgage was something that was a little bit of a headwind for the whole group, but any other information you glean from your conversations with the Fed. And then maybe what you need to do to bring that down in future years?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I - we haven't really had the full debrief. So we are getting that set up so we can go through and kind of understand their models better. I think that's been one of the concerns of the industry that it's not that transparent to us. But kind of when we look at the results, there's a couple of things that could have been a factor. So one is the build of the allowance when we took relatively high charge-offs we had a significant build was built into their models, which we didn't have in our models. And that alone probably cost us 30 basis points of a 60% increase or something like that. So that's one thing that we'll want to talk about and understand better. And then questions about we did a deal and did the onetime expenses get incorporated or we've done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario are our hedges getting full benefit. So we just have some questions that we want to poke at. But in any case, I think the bigger point here is that we can roll with this 8.5% and we have plenty of capital, and we have an appreciable buffer versus that capital. So it really doesn't affect kind of our capital management strategies. But we would like to see it get kind of back into line. We think it's a bit elevated relative to where it should be, and we'll be having those conversations with the Fed in the coming weeks.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I think that as you get past this year, where we have those integration expenses, and there's a hypothesis that, but that will roll off as you get into next year. And we'll have another bite at the apple next year given the fact that we're going to be doing this again. And in the end, the SCB is not our constraint. Our constraint is our own view of what capital we need to be prudent to support our business. And frankly, where the Fed and the regulators are headed with required kind of levels outside of the SCB is going to be our constraint. So we're going to be, as Bruce mentioned earlier, about 200 basis points over the SCB by the end of the year and probably heading towards earlier compliance with whatever the Fed comes out within most. So we're feeling pretty darn good about the capital position, notwithstanding the SCB.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. And the BSO should have a positive impact on your risk-weighted assets. Should that also have a positive impact on the SCB?\nJohn Woods: No, it will - it might. I mean, I think more importantly, it will - it gives us flexibility to rotate RWA capital into relationship lending and return that capital. To the extent that those front book opportunities are not there, we probably have the opportunity to do both, where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy back. It doesn't have a direct impact on the SCB.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead.\nVivek Juneja: Hi, thank you. Just a follow-up on the First Republic banker question. Bruce, Brendon, would requirements do you - what are your pricing assumptions? You said you're trying to bring the pricing to yours, but then what are the assumptions for what the bankers need to deliver to be able to recoup their - or earn their guarantees? And secondly, given that this was a white glove service, which is obviously very expensive, what changes are you planning to make to that to be able to get to your hurdle profitability targets?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. We already, prior to the lift-out of the private bankers, had a relationship-based pricing in play in all of our asset classes, including mortgage. So when you bring heavy levels of deposits in AUM, we price down modestly for that. So we don't have any intention of changing what we already do. And so our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that we've had in play for a while. So as you think about pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business commercial lending, we're not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy Citizens in how we operate the business to make sure that we're considering the full relationship and that we're really competitive in pricing. But we're not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either lending return - \nBruce Van Saun: And I think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that.\nBrendan Coughlin: They do.\nBruce Van Saun: So I'd say the one thing that they won't have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages. But I think they come in with their eyes wide open on that. And quite honestly, the deeply discounted mortgages are probably now back on your balance sheet because people aren't refinancing those at a good clip. So they'll probably sit there for a long time. But anyway, we will kind of do business in a commercial way. And again, the bigger the relationship, the better the pricing generally. And so I think the team coming over is very comfortable with that.\nBrendan Coughlin: And another question around expenses, implied in the comments that John and Bruce both made around breakevens inside of 2024 is the team's production covering kind of TOP guarantees to come over. So we've been really thoughtful about how we do that. But obviously, we've got the way these folks get paid is on a book of business model. And they're going to go out and develop a lot of business, and we're going to give them the runway to do that. We had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen and make sure the operations excellence is available here at Citizens. The cost of that is considered in all of our guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business. And we're already well underway on tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure we're creating the conditions for them.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I'd say there, we probably had the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you kind of get one shot with some of these customers. And so we've got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need. I would say one other silver lining from that also is that, that will help us up our game in customer experience more broadly, the kind of initiatives that we're taking to make sure that we make this a great experience. There'll be some things that spin off from that, that we can move to other parts of the bank, without a question.\nVivek Juneja: Okay. Thank you. And for a follow-up, just Don. Don, what are you seeing on the whole sponsor side given with high rates in the market? When - what level do you expect it to come back to even in '24, say, just given if rates stay high, yes, some cuts, but I don't think anybody is expecting it to go back to where we were 1.5 years ago? So any thoughts on what level of activity do you think we get back?\nDon McCree: We'll see. High level, our pipelines are about 30% higher than they were at this time last quarter. So we're seeing the pipelines build. Sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations whether they can get to actual transactions or not, although there have been. Some there was a Worldpay transaction that was announced a few weeks ago. So we're beginning to see some transactions. Remember, one of the things that we benefit from, and I've said this a couple of quarters, is we tend to play in smaller deals, right? So we're $100 million to $750 million to $1 billion in terms of deal size, whether it be advisory or financing. We were number one in the middle-market leveraged finance league tables in the last quarter. Volumes were down, but we were the number one institution playing. So we're gaining share for what's available. So do I think we're going to be back to 2021 levels? No. But I think if you get stability in rates, it's the beginning of deal formation will happen, and it will just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers. And there's just a lot of companies in our portfolio that just need to sell. They want to sell for generational leases. So there are things that are available, deals make it over-equitized just to keep the interest burden down if value doesn't come down. But we're starting to see a lot of conversations going. So I don't think we're going to be off to the races, but I think it's going to continually build. And I think '24 could be a pretty good year.\nVivek Juneja: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\nBruce Van Saun: All right. Thanks, Alan, and thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the second quarter, referencing Slide 5. For the second quarter, we generated underlying net income of $531 million and EPS of $1.04. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13.9%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter, and our margin was 3.17%, down 13 basis points with funding costs outpacing the increase in asset yields. We delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of the franchise with spot deposits up 3% or $5.5 billion. Period-end loans and average loans were down 2% quarter-over quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, including our ongoing run-off of auto. These dynamics improved our period end LDR to 85% and our liquidity position remains very strong. We reduced FHLB borrowings by about $7 billion to approximately $5 billion outstanding at quarter-end and we increased our available liquidity by 19% to about $79 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total NCOs of 40 basis points are up 6 basis points linked-quarter as expected, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs, increased general office. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $176 million and a reserve build of $24 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.52% up from 1.47% at the end of the first quarter, with the increase directed to the general office portfolio. We repurchased $256 million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.3%, up from 10% in the first quarter. And our tangible book value per share is down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates. On the next few slides, I'll provide further details related to second quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was down 3%, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 13 basis points to 3.17% with the increase in asset yields, more than offset by higher funding costs, given the competitive environment and migration from lower cost categories. With Fed funds increasing 500 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 42% through the second quarter which has been rising in response to the rate and competitive environment and is generally in the pack with peers. Our asset sensitivity at the end of the second quarter is still approximately 1% which is broadly stable with the prior quarter. Our received fixed cash flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter as we held off on adding further protection as rates continued to rise during the quarter. Moving on to Slide 7, we posted a solid fee performance in a challenging market environment. Fees were up 4% linked-quarter with card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes and increases in wealth and mortgage banking fees. FX and derivatives revenue was modestly lower. Capital markets fees were stable with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees, largely offset by increased syndications and M&A advisory fees, despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter. We continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half. Mortgage fees were slightly higher as production fees increased with market volumes, partially offset by lower margins and lower servicing fees. And finally, wealth fees were also up slightly reflecting growth in AUM. On Slide 8, expenses were broadly stable linked-quarter as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were offset by higher equipment and software costs, as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs. On Slide 9, average and period-end loans were both down 2% linked-quarter, reflecting balance sheet optimization actions in C&I, as well as the impact of planned auto runoff. Education was lower given the rate environment, but this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and from equity. Commercial utilization was down a bit as clients look to deleverage, given higher rates and we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment. On Slide 10, period-end deposits were up $5.5 billion or 3% linked-quarter with growth led by consumer up $3 billion and commercial up $2 billion. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 47 basis points, which translates to a 101% sequential beta and a 42% cumulative beta. Strong deposit flows and a very successful auto loan collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing FHLB levels by about $7 billion. Given our BSO objectives, we grew deposits, which drove a favorable mix-shift away from wholesale funding. As a result, our total cost of funds was relatively well-behaved up 38 basis points. Next, I'll move to Slide 11 to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise. With 67% of our deposits skewed toward consumer and highly-diversified across product mix and channels, we are able to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment. We increased the portion of our insured and secured deposits from 68% to 70% linked-quarter and when combined with our available liquidity of $79 billion, our available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about 150% from around 120% in the first quarter. As rates grew another 25 basis points in the second quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher-yielding categories, primarily in commercial with noninterest bearing now representing about 23% of the book. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and should stabilize from here. Moving on to Slide 12. We saw a good credit results in retail again this quarter and higher charge-offs in commercial. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points, up 6 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects an increase in the general office segment of commercial real-estate, partly offset by a slight improvement in retail, primarily due to the strength in used-car values. Nonperforming loans are 79 basis points of total loans, up 15 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting an increase in general office, which tends to be lumpy. It's also worth noting that overall delinquencies were lower sequentially with retail and commercial both improving slightly. Retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to Slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $24 million, which includes a $41 million increase in CRE general office, even after covering charge-offs of $56 million. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.52%, which is a 5 basis points increase in the second quarter. The runoff of the noncore portfolio primarily auto, facilitated the reallocation of reserves to CRE. The reserve coverage in general office was increased to a strong 8%. On Slide 14, you'll see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $313 million this quarter which represents coverage of 8%. In addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the general office portfolio, we continuously perform a detailed loan level analysis that takes into account property-specific details, such as location, building quality, operating performance and maturity. We have a very experienced CRE team more focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work-through the property and borrower-specific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. Our reserves reflect this detailed view of the portfolio as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page. The property value, default rate and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve, are adequate for the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what we've seen in previous CRE downturns. It's worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration behind what we expect would be very manageable, given our strong reserve and capital position. On the following Slide 15, there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail on the type and location of the general office portfolio. You can see out of the $3.9 billion general office portfolio, 94% is Class A or B with the majority in suburban areas, which seem to be performing better than central business districts. On the bottom left-hand side of the page, it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies, as well as the top 10 MSAs, listed on the bottom right-hand side. Broadly for New York MSA, we are starting to see return to office trends picking-up and more than 80% of the portfolio was outside Manhattan where property dynamics tend to be more favorable. Washington DC is 100% class A&D and 95% suburban. Moving to Slide 16, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as we look to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment. We returned a total of $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to Slide 17. You'll see that our CET1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group. This strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the IPO in maintaining robust capital levels. If you incorporate the removal of AOCI opt-out, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 0.5% and we also expect that this replace us near the top of our peer group again this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly 20 basis points of CET1 ratio post-dividend each quarter in 2H '23 before share buybacks. So, as you see, we've been focused for a while and playing really strong defense with a focus on capital, liquidity, funding and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite. And that's the job one. Even long before the turmoil we saw in the first quarter. But we also recognized the need to continue to play offense. We need to be selective, investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win. Over the next few slides, I'll spotlight a few of the exciting things we're doing and ensure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on Slides 19 and 20, we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we hired about 50 senior private bankers and 100 related support professionals who were with First Republic. As many of you know, for a number of years, we've had an interest in growing our wealth business, both organically and inorganically. So we made a number of investments on the organic side, hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a transactional business to a very customer-centric financial planning approach. That's been a slow and steady build over the years. And then we supplemented that with the Clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago and that's gone incredibly well. So, with our customer-centric culture, our financial strength and the full range of products and services we offer, we were the perfect fit for these bankers. We really admire their approach to delivering the bank to their customers in a unique way with white glove service. This is really a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more like, Florida and California. In fact, we think the overlap with JMP in San Francisco is extremely complementary. These bankers serve the types of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank, high and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families, often the strong connections to middle-market companies with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital firms, serving the innovation economy. We have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and ensure that they are positioned to deliver that bank to their clients. We plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business with Clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort. We think this is going to be extremely attractive from a financial perspective. These teams and their staff, about 150 people in total, on-boarded late in the second quarter with revenue begin to ramp in the fourth quarter. Financial impact for the second half will be $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS plus an initial notable cost of about $0.03 for 2023. These bankers have hit the ground running and are out-working to build their book of business and we expect the effort to breakeven around the middle of 2024. By 2025, we expect EPS accretion of roughly 5% with 2025 year end projections of about $9 billion in loans, $11 billion of deposits and $10 billion of assets under management. So overall, a very exciting advance for us. Now let's go to Slide 21, and I'll walk you through how we'll be managing our balance sheet over the next few years. Since the IPO, we're prudently growing our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding with an eye towards maximizing returns. With the increase in rates since the end of 2021, plus the advent of quantitative tightening and more recently, the heightened competition for deposits, we are entering the next stage of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending, while lowering our LDR, which will improve our liquidity profile and benefit returns. In order to make this effort clear and show the benefits we expect, we've established a $14 billion non-core portfolio which is comprised of our $10 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship purchased customer loans - consumer loans. This portfolio will run down fairly quickly with about $9 billion of run-off expected by the end of 2025. Moving to Slides 22 and 23, you'll see that as the non-core loan portfolio runs down, this allows us to pay down higher-cost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio. We will also be growing relationship-based lending to the private bank and raising deposits to self-fund that growth. Despite the size of the run-off portfolio, we expect to see modest loan growth in 2024, picking up in 2025, driven by opportunities across retail and C&I as well as our private bank effort. The net result of these actions is an improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix and higher returns. Next on Slide 24, a quick update on our entry into New York Metro where some really exciting things are happening. With the branch conversions behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities. We continue to be encouraged by our early success. We've seen strong sales in the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in their network. Most importantly, we have seen a steady improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. On the commercial banking side, we've got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from larger firms and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines with middle-market firms. And we are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the market. On Slide 25, we have a great opportunity to build on Citizens Access, our national digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We moved to a modern fully cloud-based core platform and we are trying to add checking capabilities later this year. Down the road, we plan to converge our legacy core system with this modern platform. We are confident that a single integrated platform will be more cost-efficient and flexible in meeting our client's needs. We aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass-affluent market segment. And on the right side of the page is CitizensPay where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. CitizensPay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank with very high promoter scores and this has been a great performer from a credit perspective. We have some fantastic partners on the platform for a while, such as Apple, Microsoft, Best Buy, BJ's and Vivint. And we are always very excited to welcome new partners like Peloton, Tre, The Tile Shop and Wisetack to platform. On Slide 26, I'll highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Over the last several years, private capital fundraising had led - has led to record deal formation, M&A activity and substantial fees. The activity has been relatively muted recently and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital. So there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity. We have been executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years and we've done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor lead tables, particularly in the middle market. We have made significant investments in talent and capabilities, including five advisory acquisitions since 2017. And our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities. Our success supporting private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years and we are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer. Let's move to Slide 27 for an update on our TOP program. Our latest TOP 8 program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have decided to augment the program to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We have increased our targeted benefit by $15 million to $115 million by accelerating some of our other efforts and to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs. We have also begun planning for our TOP 9 program, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in procurement. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA and I'm very confident that we'll continue to deliver these benefits to the bank. Moving to Slide 28, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter for Citizens, which excludes the impact of the Private Bank and I will also provide some comments for the full year. The outlook takes into account another rate increase, followed by Fed on hold for the remainder of this year. For the third quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 4%. Noninterest income to be up by approximately 3%. Net interest expense should be broadly stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly. Our CET1 is expected to rise modestly from 10.3% with additional share repurchases planned, which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment. Relating to the full year, our liquidity position is quite strong and given the BSO actions I discussed earlier, we will continue to build on this, targeting an LDR of low-to mid-80s by the end of the year, positioning us well for anticipated regulatory changes. Worth noting we are already - we already are fully LDR compliant with Category 3 bank requirements. Based on the forward curve, we are expecting a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta of 49% to 50%. Our net interest margin should begin to stabilize in Q4 as the Fed is expected to reach the end of the rate hike cycle. We are off to a great start of drilling up the private bank, and we expect the EPS impact of this to be $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.02 to $0.04 in the fourth quarter. So we really think of this as a capital investment. To wrap up, our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to navigate a turbulent external environment. We are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, which will serve us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead. Our balance sheet strength also positions us very well to focus on our strategic priorities to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive returns. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce. Yes, I'll go ahead and start off. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think, broadly, we're seeing the impact of the rate environment on our net interest margin. We're managing it quite well as the Fed is continuing on its hiking cycle. And as you get into the end of the year, taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization activities, we see NIM flattening out and kind of holding it around 3% or so, as you get to the end of the year. The tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful and will continue to build into '24 and so those are the big drivers there, I think that also contributing to that NIM stability would be the fact that we think that balance sheet migration is starting to stabilize. And also you can ignore the fact that the Private Bank itself as you get out into '24, would start to deliver accretive NIM. So we're feeling good about the profile after we get through this last hikes from the Fed here in July, watching that NIM starts to stabilize as you get into the end of the year. Yes. And it's a little bit front-end loaded as the expenses will come in and drive probably more in the neighborhood of $0.06 of that $0.08 to $0.10 happening in third quarter with $0.02 to $0.04 really into the fourth quarter. And it's primarily expenses in the neighborhood of $40 million or so, as you get into the 3Q and 4Q and but the loan book starts to build later this quarter and into 4Q. So that gives you the front-end loaded of that $0.08 to $0.10 into 3Q. Yes. I mean, I think from the NIM standpoint, you're talking about '23, just confirming, Erika, is that - Yes, no, you referenced '24. But the answer is actually a little bit similar, but what we do see is, after the Fed hikes here in July and that the impact of that burns in in the third quarter that we do see NIM flattening out there between 3Q and 4Q, having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year around 3%. So maybe a touch higher in 3Q net interest margin, but seeing that profile begin to flatten out and I think the key drivers of that, the pieces in parts as I mentioned, we're starting to see the deceleration in deposit migration, the negative deposit migration. So that's a good early green shoot, that's consistent with the fact that our DDA levels are basically where we were back to pre-pandemic. And so that ends up being at an expected landing zone as you get into the end-of-the year. So we'll see that flattening out. You'll see the tailwinds from this - from the runoff block starting to kick in, the reallocation of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending and the ability to pay-down some higher-cost funding as you get into the end of the year. And so that starts to bolster net interest margin, which we do think carries into '24, and we think that there are a number of positive developments in '24 that would allow us to hold that NIM out into even beyond the fourth quarter. Yes. Maybe I'll just start off in a couple of areas. Just when you think about NII, similar numbers that you're throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we will see them come out. I think our NII be a little better than that and into fourth quarter, I think we have some opportunities to - if interest earning assets are going to be stabilized, as Bruce indicated and net interest margin stabilized, so we think the NII has also stabilized at that solid levels. So that was I think the first question that you had. I mean I think the - Yes, there is a very limited adjustments. Things do roll-off and come on, but broadly, our asset sensitivity profile was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, meaning we are - we were still asset sensitive. So a rate rise, which we're about to get from the Fed does actually contribute to NII and net interest margin for us. So from that perspective, all of that has been built into the commentary that we've been giving you in terms of swap roll-off and our ongoing positive asset sensitivity. Again, when you get - when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters, we have a number of tailwinds. You've got flattening out non-interest-bearing migration. So that's no longer expected to be a big headwind. You've got the run-off book that we talked about and that runoff book is going to be rotated into relationship lending at higher yields. So the runoff - And paying down high cost funding, right, so which - where we have a negative kind of spread situation there. We already mentioned the fact that the Private Bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year and that the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank. I think, throughout there is that, just front book back book dynamics, where you basically have originations in the front book. Just in the securities portfolio alone, there's 300 basis points positive front book, back book in terms of - we're actually creating a bigger security stock, but we're doing at the right time where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable. And so we're putting a lot of way from that standpoint. And we're seeing back into the loan book, spreads on our front book originations are higher than they were. And for example in C&I, spreads are up 50 basis points over the last year, year-over-year. So that's also a tailwind and all those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that - manage the rate environment and the other items that we have -- Yes, agree. So balance sheet optimization plus the fact that when if rates were - rates begin to fall, if they do, we don't have that happening in the fourth quarter by the way. We have that happening in '24. We have the Fed on-hold for the rest of the year and we have the Fed just based on the forward curve, right, having the Fed ending around 4% in '24. So it's really until '24, where you see those down rate scenarios. And in the down rate scenario, I mean, that's where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you. And so, then you start getting some of that coming in as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when rates start to fall and so I would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds I already articulated as to why we feel like we could hold the stable NIM. Yes, I agree with all of that. And I think the issue is in credit RWA versus operational risk RWA, Gerard. So, I think there was the view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk RWA and maybe it wouldn't be much of an increase expected at the regional bank level, but I did see - we did see those reports on residential mortgages. We'll see how it all plays out. But on the operational risk side of things, with a complex fee-based sort of businesses are where a lot of that is directed and it's not just - we don't have much of exposure - as much of exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry do. So broadly we felt like that we would be impacted possibly a little less than most and we're sitting with capital a little more than most. So from that perspective, we feel pretty well-positioned for the uncertainty of the regulatory. We are making process and as you heard from Bruce, we're growing capital into the end of the year and I think a 10 - something in the neighborhood of 10.5% CET1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come down the road from the Fed. Yes. I mean, I think, and as you know in this portfolio that we set up, that's - it's entirely a retail portfolio in terms of that $14 billion, but there are nevertheless in parallel BSO activity is continuing in the commercial side, and let Don talk about that. Yes, I think there's two items that we look at. One is just the - as we are getting back to the historical place that the platform generated noninterest-bearing pre-pandemic, and so that's been sort of a foundational spot that we think creates some solidify of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer. So that's one really important spot. So around that 23% level is about how we see it. And then the second item is that, in the second quarter, we started to see some deceleration for the first time in several quarters. We started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating. And then we have a number of, I would say activities on the product and low-cost strategy front that we're seeing some really positive uptick on in retail, in particular, and so - Yes. I'll just reiterate the fact that, as you mentioned, we took $56 million, that's a 1.5%. So that - we've got 8.5% - we got 8% set-aside, so that implies a 9.5% coverage for the losses through the cycle and we think that's pretty darn adequate, matter of fact, very strong. And so, I think that - as you also mentioned NPLs flattening out and charge-offs kind of getting in the run-rate rather than step-change from here which I think is important to reemphasize. And maybe just turn it over to Don. Yes. I think that as you get past this year, where we have those integration expenses, and there's a hypothesis that, but that will roll off as you get into next year. And we'll have another bite at the apple next year given the fact that we're going to be doing this again. And in the end, the SCB is not our constraint. Our constraint is our own view of what capital we need to be prudent to support our business. And frankly, where the Fed and the regulators are headed with required kind of levels outside of the SCB is going to be our constraint. So we're going to be, as Bruce mentioned earlier, about 200 basis points over the SCB by the end of the year and probably heading towards earlier compliance with whatever the Fed comes out within most. So we're feeling pretty darn good about the capital position, notwithstanding the SCB. No, it will - it might. I mean, I think more importantly, it will - it gives us flexibility to rotate RWA capital into relationship lending and return that capital. To the extent that those front book opportunities are not there, we probably have the opportunity to do both, where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy back. It doesn't have a direct impact on the SCB."

            "content": "Yes, so we've been at this for probably three or four years now as we just grown out relationships where we haven't been able to achieve across all that we've thought we have been achieved when we were going into the credit, several years ago. So it's really an ongoing effort. It's been running about $1 billion a year, and we probably will be running about that same pace. The good news is we've been able to replace some of that with growth in places like New York Metro, where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis, particularly in the middle market, as we bring on these new hires. On the CRE side, as everybody knows, there is not a lot of liquidity, but there is some liquidity and we're actually moving some of our exposures after the agencies and then do some private capital also. So we'll try to liquefy CRE, particularly multifamily over the next couple of quarters, couple of years to the best we can bring those overall exposures down, even though they're performing pretty well. Yes, that's right. I mean, we've been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely and as Bruce said, it's a combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall and bringing on more clients on the cash management side. As I said, in New York Metro, the things that we're adding are really full wallet for cash management relationships and those bring really nice deposits. And then on the product side, we've done a lot around green deposits and carbon offsets deposits in our ESG strategy that was approved to be quite profitable. We've built out escrow products and bankruptcy products. So there's a variety of product development things which are attracting nice operating deposits with some nice breadth for them. I think you guys have said it was 26 loans, so you're pretty close to the 30. That's pretty good that you know that. But I think the thing I'd emphasize is we've literally gone through every single loan one by one. Everyone is different. It's property-specific, it's MSA-specific, it's rental-specific, its sponsor-specific. And we're just seeing - we're starting to see outcomes. And outcomes are a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor. You might have a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry, and you might charge it off. So - and I think that we have a pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward. And things could always change, but I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've been very conservative based on what we see. And I will emphasize, I mean, we're not originating anything really of any scale and origination. So our whole origination team, in addition to our credit team, in addition to our work path team, is focused on working with our sponsors to basically - In the office sector, yes. And the rest - by the way, the rest of the real estate, both multifamily and industrial data centers, I think, it looks like it's holding up extremely well. We're really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of those slip up. We'll see. High level, our pipelines are about 30% higher than they were at this time last quarter. So we're seeing the pipelines build. Sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations whether they can get to actual transactions or not, although there have been. Some there was a Worldpay transaction that was announced a few weeks ago. So we're beginning to see some transactions. Remember, one of the things that we benefit from, and I've said this a couple of quarters, is we tend to play in smaller deals, right? So we're $100 million to $750 million to $1 billion in terms of deal size, whether it be advisory or financing. We were number one in the middle-market leveraged finance league tables in the last quarter. Volumes were down, but we were the number one institution playing. So we're gaining share for what's available. So do I think we're going to be back to 2021 levels? No. But I think if you get stability in rates, it's the beginning of deal formation will happen, and it will just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers. And there's just a lot of companies in our portfolio that just need to sell. They want to sell for generational leases. So there are things that are available, deals make it over-equitized just to keep the interest burden down if value doesn't come down. But we're starting to see a lot of conversations going. So I don't think we're going to be off to the races, but I think it's going to continually build. And I think '24 could be a pretty good year."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. The turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter, but we continue to navigate well and we delivered solid financial performance. In particular, we're pleased with the strong results we achieved around capital, liquidity and funding. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points to 10.3% in the quarter and we were able to repurchase in excess of $250 million in stock. We grew spot deposits by 3% or $5.5 billion and our spot loan-to-deposit ratio improved to 85%. Our federal home loan bank borrowings dropped by $7 billion to $5 billion and contingent liquidity grew by 20% to $79 billion. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.04 an ROTCE of 13.9%. NII was down 3% reflecting higher funding costs, in line with our expectations. Non-interest income grew 4%, slightly less than expected as capital markets saw a few deals pushed to the third quarter. The expenses were broadly stable as expected and credit cost continue to be manageable. One of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent, largely from the First Republic platform to meaningfully augment our Citizens Private Bank and Wealth Management business. While expense investments will lead revenues in 2023, we project the business to be accretive in 2024 and significantly profitable in the medium term. In our presentation this morning, we will highlight this initiative in more detail. And we'll also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong medium-term outperformance. Execution of these initiatives continues to be strong. We're setting up a non-core run-off portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect around $9 billion of loan run-off, largely in auto by the end of 2025. This capacity will be utilized to fund more strategic loan portfolios, to pay down high-cost debt, and to build cash and securities. In parallel, the Private Bank will grow loans over this period by $9 billion, which will be funded by $11 billion of incremental deposits. The net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital, along with the positive impact on earnings per share, ROTCE and liquidity. We've also included more detail on our CRE loan portfolio. Our general office reserve is now at 8%. While we continue to see increases in criticized assets and charge-offs in this particular portfolio, we believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we anticipate that the environment while stabilizing, will continue to be challenging. Our net interest margin will decline again in Q3, given higher funding costs. We expect our terminal beta to reach 49% to 50% at year end. Our fees to continue to grow sequentially. Expenses will be well-controlled and credit should be broadly stable. We will further build our CET1 ratio while continuing to repurchase shares. Overall, we're holding in okay on current-period performance with mid-teens ROTCE in 2023, while making the investments to deliver a stronger franchise, attractive growth and returns, and afforded by balance sheet over the medium-term. We continue to build a great bank and we remain very excited about our future. Our capital strength and our attractive franchise, position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John? Okay. Thanks, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A. The one thing I would say to that, Scott, it's Bruce, is, this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth business. We've been looking for acquisition ideas and it's been very expensive with very long tangible book value earn backs, many times would be over five years, which is beyond our appetite. So to actually do this in a kind of de novo build-up basis, you incur some capital expense in the short run, but it's almost the same as if you kind of equate it to an outlays that ultimately starts to generate revenues. And the nice thing about this is that it's accretive already in the second year and kind of earn-back on this thing is under two years. So we look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the near-term EPS. But look, there is a capital outlay, which we burn some expense dollars to get it off the ground and then all of a sudden, it's making us money and it really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a 5% accretion in 2025, which is kind of within 2.5 years, in the second year of doing a deal If you compare that to some of the other transactions that we've done, including the bank acquisitions, it's pretty darn powerful. So very excited about this opportunity. And I would comment, Erika, that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where we wanted to get the Fed - the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings lower and really take a big step in lowering the LVR. And so we paid up a little bit to achieve that and the impact of that full quarter effects the third quarter guide, but I think at this point, we feel that we don't need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits. We can have a more stable deposit profile. As John indicated, less migration from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing and so there won't be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects Q4 from Q3, because we'll be kind of looking at a more stable profile in Q3. Just to put a point on that too is, any swap impacts are in our forward guide, Erika. So we've already contemplated that. So there's nothing and they didn't really move. We didn't do any adjustments in the second quarter, so. Paying off high-cost debt. So I think what John described, Erika, is a number of tailwinds that should be positive. So if the Fed is cutting next year, that potentially is a negative, but we have these positive things to offset that, which gives us kind of that stable view on the NIM into '24. Yes, I'll just close and you got an extended period of time here, Erika, and we're very interested in NII and NIM, which I'm sure is on a lot of investors' minds. But, kind of bigger picture is, we're kind of transitioning the loan book to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital and better opportunities for cross-selling deepening with customers. And so we're kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next year. It's a little hard to give you full guidance at this point, given a lot of uncertainty still in the market. We're giving you our best instincts at this point on that. But I feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through '24 and then even look out to '25, that - kind of, with the lift-off of this Private Bank effort and the kind of run-down of these less strategic portfolios that we're going to get a lot of benefit from this and we're really poised to do quite well, I think looking out into kind of back-half of '24 into '25. Sure. I think - it's Bruce. I think, by the end of the year, we could see it getting to 10.5% which is a bit above our stated range have been 9.5% to 10%. I think given all the uncertainty that's out there in the economy plus direction of travel from regulators, that managing it up like that is sensible. Having said that, we're still generating quite good returns, which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio, but also repurchase our stock, which we think is great value at the current pricing. So that's how we're looking at it. And then, as we go through 2024 at this point, our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same that we can at least hold that 10.5% and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators. But we have the wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further. Hi, Gerard. Let me start up. Quickly flip it to John. But, clearly, I would say there's mixed views on whether that's - sound proposal at this point and I think the industry itself - liquidity itself very well through the pandemic, through this period of turmoil in the first half of the year and I think many folks have commented that the industry has strong capital and so in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures, is it appropriate that the thing that needs to be fixed is more capital in the banking system.  I don't know. I question whether that's appropriate, and we'll see how it plays out. I think there'll be lots of dialogue around that. I think from our standpoint, by moving our capital position higher, we're anticipating any of what could come down the pike is something that we can absorb. We're in a very strong position relative to our SCB, which, by the way, we still have some questions about how it landed where it did but nonetheless we're well above that. And we're well above if the AOCI filter goes away, we already have sufficient capital to meet our new propose SCB. So we're in a position of strength, Gerard. I think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as we get through this transition period and hit our medium-term financial targets. But I would kind of at least comment that I'm not sure that that's the answer when we had a series of management supervisory failures and poor asset liability management. That really was the problem that caused this term off, not a lack of capital in the banking system. So I'll get off my soapbox and I'll pass it over to John. Turn that over to Brendan. Yes. I would say that is something we felt comfortable with in Q3. We were going through the Q2. We were going through the CCAR process at the time, but we saw the opportunity to build kind of have our cake and needed to build the ratio while also repurchasing shares and I think we'll still be in that position. So we still have noncore kind of rundown working for us, which is releasing RWAs. So you should again have a chance to somewhat - have your cake and needed to both in Q3 and Q4. Let's ask Brendan to pick up and add some color. Right. Thank you. Let me start. And John or Don can add. But we feel quite good about A), the overall nature of what we have, and B) then - so there's good diversification, good quality characteristics. We have some really good people that are really focused hard on this and they are monitoring this loan-by-loan. They see the upcoming maturities to get way in front of those. So we're having good dialog with borrowers. And I'd say, we did a good job - relatively good job in the first half of absorbing some of maturities. Probably about 30 loans, I think came up for maturity, which is about the number that we're going to have in the second half and it's about the number that we're going to have in the first half of next year. It's about the number that we're going to have in the fourth quarter and next year. And if you look at the net result of that, while we have an increase in criticized, we have an increase this quarter was a little lumpy in NPAs in this sector and that probably levels off. I'd say, we were able to build our reserve and absorb charge-offs. So we took $56 million in charge-offs. So that's another kind of 1.5% loss content. If you look at the 8%, it's effectively higher while what we just absorbed. And so, could we go for another few quarters with absorbing charge-offs on a pay-as-you-go basis with what we're providing and hold the reserve flat? Yes, possibly, that could happen. And then at some point, does that tip over and then you don't need as much reserves because you burned some of those losses through your charge-off line. So anybody, that's just a little color about how we think about it, John. I don't know if you want to add anything to go direct to Don. In the office sector. Yes. I - we haven't really had the full debrief. So we are getting that set up so we can go through and kind of understand their models better. I think that's been one of the concerns of the industry that it's not that transparent to us. But kind of when we look at the results, there's a couple of things that could have been a factor. So one is the build of the allowance when we took relatively high charge-offs we had a significant build was built into their models, which we didn't have in our models. And that alone probably cost us 30 basis points of a 60% increase or something like that. So that's one thing that we'll want to talk about and understand better. And then questions about we did a deal and did the onetime expenses get incorporated or we've done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario are our hedges getting full benefit. So we just have some questions that we want to poke at. But in any case, I think the bigger point here is that we can roll with this 8.5% and we have plenty of capital, and we have an appreciable buffer versus that capital. So it really doesn't affect kind of our capital management strategies. But we would like to see it get kind of back into line. We think it's a bit elevated relative to where it should be, and we'll be having those conversations with the Fed in the coming weeks. And I think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that. So I'd say the one thing that they won't have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages. But I think they come in with their eyes wide open on that. And quite honestly, the deeply discounted mortgages are probably now back on your balance sheet because people aren't refinancing those at a good clip. So they'll probably sit there for a long time. But anyway, we will kind of do business in a commercial way. And again, the bigger the relationship, the better the pricing generally. And so I think the team coming over is very comfortable with that. Yes. And I'd say there, we probably had the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you kind of get one shot with some of these customers. And so we've got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need. I would say one other silver lining from that also is that, that will help us up our game in customer experience more broadly, the kind of initiatives that we're taking to make sure that we make this a great experience. There'll be some things that spin off from that, that we can move to other parts of the bank, without a question. All right. Thanks, Alan, and thanks again, everyone, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes, so, we are really excited obviously about this initiative and it's a very strategic acceleration of our Wealth Management business. But to your point, it does come with scaling up the bank as well while we are aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models. We're going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive at the top of the house. So what you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that while will be competitive, we're not going to kind of lead with undercutting the market and pricing to make sure we have the right margin. We will have an incredibly disciplined credit appetite. We don't expect to take a step forward or step in the wrong direction in terms of credit risk profile. In fact, we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low-risk loan generation. We are going to ensure that we're driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the Private Bank that we're getting core operating deposits, whether that's from individuals or from businesses. It's really important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth. And lastly, from a compensation perspective, we're going to rationalize the compensation model the best we can within the confines of a private bank to ensure that those - the combination of those factors give us a return profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall ROE, but also on things like NIM. So the balance sheet on the deposit side, certainly we have the mix of cash management operating deposits as well as interest-bearing. But we are going to heather all relationships to being primary banking, whether it's corporate or whether it's personal. So you could expect low cost DDA to be mixed in with interest-bearing for a healthy profile primary banking relationships. On the asset side, I'd say we're expecting about a 50/50 mix, what I would call sort of consumer personal retail lending and small-business and corporate lending. And on the personal lending side, really the large asset classes are going to be mortgage, home equity, and eventually partner loan program, where we are putting capital to individuals to engage as a partner and a higher-end consulting firm or private-equity firm, very traditional low-risk assets. But this lodges the operating deposits and ultimately lead you to AUM. And on the business side, as mentioned earlier, the profile of the team we got over, does have a bent towards the innovation economy. So we're expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships with private equity and venture. And small segment where it's appropriate relationship-wise on potentially multifamily in a very-high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship. All of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full end-to-end customer relationships that include deposits and ultimately AUM growth. So it's a very integrated end-to-end business model and we feel like we've got the right recreation of the service strategy, married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get better profitability and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of time. If that - we think we can get a really good growth around this, but we will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul. Yes, couple of quick points, just a quick recall, as we've talked over the last bunch of quarters. The consumer portfolio has been under a five-six year transformation for quite some time and it's in a very, very different starting points through the beginning of the cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in things like customer primary - primacy growth and households, or mass-affluent mix has improved and low-cost deposit profile has moved up. So coming into the cycle, we were very confident that we'd be more pure like or maybe outperform and data that we're seeing with benchmarking suggested in the consumer bank, we are indeed better-than-average versus peers right now on all the mentions interest-bearing cost, beta, as well as low-cost control. So we feel pretty good how we're performing against peers, it is starting to stabilize. So the excess surge deposits have burned down maybe by about 60%, so there's still a little bit out there. But a lot of those are starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation. If you dissect the various different segments, the wealthier segment is still having some modest outflows of rotation into interest-bearing as well as rotation outside of the banking industry. So year-over-year the wealthier segment is down about 10%. We're seeing the mass-affluent segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat and the mass-market portfolio has actually increased in net deposits and that's a function of a lot of our strategies that we put in place to really drive primacy and activity and engagement. And so we've seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of DDA balances. What we have done to drive that is a lot of product innovation. So we did things like get your paycheck two days early. It doesn't seem like a big deal, it's actually an incredibly big deal. That's driving a lot of primary banking behavior. We've got technology we put in place that when you open a new DDA, you're automatically porting over your direct deposit that seems very operationally oriented. But it actually is a dramatic improvement that things like primary banking behavior which drives low-cost deposits. We've made overdraft perform through our Peace of Mind 24-Hour Grace program and a variety of other things, which has also driven a lot of primacy and we're starting to really rev up the engines on household growth. Overall, all of those things contribute to some controllable. So we're - I think we're outperforming peers on the market, given our starting point in the cycle and we're continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these different initiatives and strategies. It is the long game. These are driving primacy in low-cost deposits. It takes a while to build up scale, but I feel like we've got a lot of the right things in place in addition to outperforming on our back-book to win the game uncontrollable where we're at right now. Yes. Yes, thanks for the question. We already, prior to the lift-out of the private bankers, had a relationship-based pricing in play in all of our asset classes, including mortgage. So when you bring heavy levels of deposits in AUM, we price down modestly for that. So we don't have any intention of changing what we already do. And so our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that we've had in play for a while. So as you think about pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business commercial lending, we're not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy Citizens in how we operate the business to make sure that we're considering the full relationship and that we're really competitive in pricing. But we're not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either lending return - They do. And another question around expenses, implied in the comments that John and Bruce both made around breakevens inside of 2024 is the team's production covering kind of TOP guarantees to come over. So we've been really thoughtful about how we do that. But obviously, we've got the way these folks get paid is on a book of business model. And they're going to go out and develop a lot of business, and we're going to give them the runway to do that. We had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen and make sure the operations excellence is available here at Citizens. The cost of that is considered in all of our guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business. And we're already well underway on tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure we're creating the conditions for them."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Allan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it\u2019s important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Hey. Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. First quarter many unexpected challenges in the environment. Nonetheless, we proved resilient and adaptable and we delivered a solid quarter for our stakeholders. We maintained a strong capital, liquidity and funding position with our CET1 ratio at 10%, our TCE ratio at 6.6% and a solid deposit franchise that skews two-thirds consumer. We have seen the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the month of March. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.10 and return on tangible equity of 15.8%. Our NII was down 3%, reflecting day count impact, slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of 3.3%. Non-interest income and non-interest expense came in broadly as expected, both impacted by seasonality. Our credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our ACL to loans ratio to 1.47%, which was up 4 basis points during the quarter and it\u2019s 17 basis points higher than our pro forma day one CECL ACL ratio. We repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter, which reduced our share count by 1.7%. In our slide deck, we tackle head on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about. I will let John run through the details, but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital, liquidity and funding position. We have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group in focusing on a stable consumer oriented and granular deposit base, and in establishing a prudent credit risk appetite and reserve level. While we had some commercial real estate exposure, we feel good about our diversification, the asset characteristics and the borrower quality. CRE criticized assets and workouts will increase during the cycle, but we currently expect losses to be manageable and we have already set aside meaningful reserves. On the regulatory front, it is clear that some changes will occur. Our hope is that the response is thoughtful and appropriate, leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before. In any case, we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process with any provisions likely to be phased in gradually. While much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense, we continue to play prudent offense by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives. We will clearly prioritize deposits, deepening and efficiency initiatives for the balance of 2023. Our New York City Metro integration is progressing extremely well with a successful core conversion of Investors Bank in February and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan. Our outlook for 2023 still shows attractive ROTCE for the full year despite the challenging environment. There\u2019s still a great deal of uncertainty, which makes forecasting more difficult, but we remain confident in the strength of our franchise and the ability to weather the storm. We are building a great bank and we remain excited about our future. Our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing slide five. Big picture, first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment. We continue to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives, including the well-executed conversion of the Investor platform in February. For the first quarter, we generated underlying net income of $560 million and EPS of $1.10. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.8%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter given the lower day count and lower interest-earning assets. Our margin was stable at 3.3%. Period-end loans and average loans were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, such as our ongoing runoff of auto. Deposit levels declined in the quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors, the compounding impact of the rate environment and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter. Importantly, our deposit levels were broadly stable during the market turbulence in March. Our quarter end LDR is 89.8% and our liquidity position remains very strong with current available liquidity as of today of about $66 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total net charge-offs of 34 basis points are up 12 basis points linked-quarter, in line with ongoing normalization trends. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $168 million and a reserve build of $35 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.47% up from 1.43% at the end of the fourth quarter, with most of the increase directed to the general office portfolio. Our current coverage ratio is about 17 basis points stronger than our pro forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3%. We repurchased $400 million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio at the top of our target range at 10% and our tangible book value per share is up 6% linked-quarter. Before I walk through the details of the results for the quarter, let me address some of the industry issues that are top of mind on slide six. First, we have a very strong capital base, which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer group, even if one were to include the rate driven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities. We have a quality deposit franchise, which has performed very well since the turbulence, which began in early March. We continue to see the benefit from all of the investments we have made since the IPO with 67% of total deposits from Consumer and a well-diversified Commercial portfolio with about 66% of our clients using us as their primary bank. Finally, 68% of deposits are insured or secured. Our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base, ample available liquidity and strong risk management capabilities. In fact, our LCR level exceeds what would be required as a Category 3 bank at March 31, 2023. Looking at credit, our metrics continue to look solid. Retail is normalizing, but is still performing quite well as the employment picture remains strong. On the Commercial side, our focus is on the CRE portfolio and on general office in particular, which is impacted by back-to-work trends and rising interest rates. We have a very strong reserve coverage of 6.7% on the general office portfolio and I will go through some of the details later. And lastly, the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in March, which in our view, was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader in regulation or management lapses. We will watch closely how things develop, but in any case, we think the process will be thoughtful and deliberate. Finally, we believe we are well positioned for any increase in regulatory requirements, given our diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios. Let\u2019s drill into the details on the next few slides, starting with capital on slide seven. We ended the quarter with one of the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group with a CET1 ratio at the top of our target range of 10%. This strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved returns over the medium-term. If you include the rate-driven unrealized loss on debt securities and AOCI, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.7%. If you remove the unrealized losses in HTM, our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by 20 basis points to 6.4%. All of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group again in this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels growing -- going forward with the ability to generate roughly 25 basis points of capital post dividend each quarter and before share buybacks. We have $1.6 billion of repurchase capacity remaining under our current Board authorization, timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external conditions. Next, I will move to slide eight to discuss our deposit franchise. As you can see, our deposit franchise is skewed towards Consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap. About 67% of our total deposits are Consumer, up from 60% at December 31st, which puts us in the top quartile of our peer group and roughly 68% of our deposits are insured by the FDIC or secured, which is up from 60% at year-end. Demand deposits represent about 26% of the book, down slightly from 27% at year-end as customers have naturally rotated towards higher yielding alternatives. On slide nine, the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear 2022 following the Investors acquisition and the commencement of QT [ph] has been in line with industry performance. We outgrew both the industry and peer average in the second half of 2022. We entered 2023 expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment and we saw a little more of that than we had forecast by about 1% and but most of that happened in January and February. Given our rundown in auto, we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter trying to hold the line on betas. In March, we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry can look to diversify their deposits in the wake of bank failures, but overall, our deposits were broadly stable during the month. This strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the IPO and this will remain a focus as we continue to build a top performing bank franchise. On slide 10, we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our customers. In Consumer, we have developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us. We have strong analytics capabilities and compelling offerings such as Citizens Plus in our Private Client Group, as well as Citizens Access, our digital bank to leverage. And with the final conversion complete at Investors, we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the New York Metro market. On the Commercial side, we have invested heavily in our treasury solutions capabilities with a state-of-the-art platform and strong talent to serve client needs. We continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their cash and drive higher operational deposits, as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits. Moving to slide 11. We are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely given the softening macro environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs. The general office sector is a particular concern as tenants rethink their space needs given the remote work trends. Given these pressures, we are evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that near 100% of our borrowers are current on their obligations with NPLs under 50 basis points. We are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and have added workout resources, but given the diversity and quality of the portfolio, we feel the credit costs will be manageable. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 2% includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of 6.7%. On slide 12, we drilled down a bit on the $6.3 billion office portfolio, which includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform quite well. The remaining $4.1 billion relates to the general office segment, which we feel is reasonably well positioned across type, geography and suburban areas and central business districts. About 90% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas and the majority is Class A. Next, I will provide further details related to first quarter results. On slide 13, net interest income was down 3%, given lower day count, which was worth about $29 million and slightly lower interest-earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.3% was stable with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs. With debt funds increasing 475 basis points at the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 36% through the end of the quarter. We continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position so that we have down rate protection in the second half of 2023 and through 2026. As we approach the height of the rate cycle, we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly 3% at the end of last year to a more neutral 1.1% at the end of the first quarter. Moving on to slide 14. We posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and higher rates. These showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 4% linked-quarter with seasonal impacts in capital markets and service charges, partly offset by strength in FX and derivatives revenue and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter and syndications and M&A advisory fees were seasonally lower. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines and signs that deal flow should pick up as the year progresses. Mortgage fees were slightly better with higher production fees as we are seeing volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity. This should continue to benefit margins over time. And finally, card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter. On slide 15, expenses came in better than expected, up only 2.8% linked-quarter, given seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits, as well as the impact of an industrywide FDIC surcharge implemented at the beginning of the year. On slide 16, average loans were down slightly a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of reduced economic activity. Average retail loans are down slightly, reflecting the planned runoff in auto, which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity. On slide 17, average deposits were down $4.7 billion or 2.6% linked-quarter, driven by seasonal and rate-related outflows. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in January and February, with balances broadly stable in March. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 51 basis points, which translates to a 73% sequential beta and a 36% cumulative beta. Moving on to slide 18. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and Commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 12 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects continued normalization. Non-performing loans are 64 basis points of total loans, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in Commercial was offset by improvements in retail. Retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter and continue to remain favorable to historical levels, but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is faring. Turning to slide 19, I will walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $35 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the Commercial portfolio, particularly general office. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.4%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the fourth quarter. The current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as CRE. Moving to slide 20. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our target range. Tangible book value per share was up 6% in the quarter and the tangible common equity ratio has improved to 6.6%. We returned a total of $605 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Shifting gears a bit, on slide 21, we continue to make good progress with our push into the New York Metro market. We were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at Investors in February, which went very smoothly. With that behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities to capture market share. We continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches where customer satisfaction has been improving significantly and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network across the legacy HSBC and Investors branches. We have also seen some good early client wins and a growing pipeline in Commercial. We look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customer focused Retail and Small Business model across the New York market. Moving to slide 22 for a quick update on our TOP 8 program. Our latest TOP program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our TOP 8 program in order to protect returns, as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We will have more to say about this in the coming months. Moving to slide 23. I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown with the Fed expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in May and then begin easing late in the year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 3%. Non-interest income is up mid-to-high single digits. Non-interest expense should be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs should remain in the mid-30s basis points. Our CET1 is expected to come in above 10% with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment. Moving to slide 24. As we think about the full year, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and funding position, while sustaining attractive returns. Of course, there is a continued level of uncertainty in the current environment. For the full year 2023, we expect NII to be up 5% to 7%. We are focused on initiatives that will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year. Non-interest income is expected to be up mid-single digits. Non-interest expense is expected to be up about 5%. Net charge-offs are expected to be in the mid-to-high 30s basis points. Our current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and known risks and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down and our CET1 ratio is expected to be above the upper end of our 9.5% to 10% target range. At 10% to 10.25% assuming stable market conditions, our share repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year. To sum up on slide 25, we delivered a solid quarter despite expected -- unexpected challenges and are ready for the uncertainty that lies ahead in 2023. Our strong capital, liquidity and funding position will serve us well to move forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future. Even as we navigate through the current challenging environment, we reaffirm our commitment to our medium-term financial targets. With that, I will hand back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. Allan, let\u2019s open it up for some Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead please.\nErika Najarian: Hi. Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nErika Najarian: As we contemplate your original net interest income guide of 11% to 14%, now up 5% to 7%. Could you walk us through what the major changes are in assumptions and how much of it was cyclical, such as the deposit runoff, higher beta and how much of it could be a little bit more structural as you anticipate the different rules such as carrying higher liquidity funded by wholesale funding?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. Let me start and I will quickly flip it to John. But I would say, Erika, that really we are just recognizing what we have seen on -- in the deposit markets and the cost of deposits is going up. I think that was partly a response to kind of the Fed rapid rises and money funds becoming alternatives. So there was, I think, a greater sensitivity around earning a return on cash that kicked in and then that was, I think, further exacerbated by the bank failures in March. And so I think there was kind of heightened velocity of deposits moving around the system and so to retain those deposits, folks had to increase rate paid. We feel that we did a pretty good job here. We came into the year expecting that there would be some seasonal outflows in Q1, and since we had built deposits in the second half of the year and then we had auto running down, so less volume on the asset side, we were prepared to let those run down by about 3.5% in the quarter. We actually saw about 1% higher than that in the runoff, but in any case, we tried to hold the line on betas and I think the betas that we posted are slightly better than peers that have reported at this point. So, but if you kind of play out the rest of the year, we are going to be paying more for our funding than we thought coming into the year and that\u2019s pretty much the big driver. I would say there might be kind of a little more disciplined in terms of who we are extending credit to, given I think probably a higher likelihood that we could see a shortened shallow recession. So there might be a little volume impact there from slightly lower earning assets and maybe there\u2019s a little mix where we are holding a little precautionary cash. But if I had to kind of put it in order, I would say, number one is the cost of deposits, and maybe slightly the volume on assets, and then thirdly, would be composition. So, John, I will flip it to you.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. Those are the right points to focus on. I\u2019d say you break it down, Erika, between rate and volume. On the rate side, as you heard from, Bruce, we have the migration from a deposit standpoint, you are going to see the full year effect of that, of what\u2019s happened over the last quarter or two and the drivers of that are well documented. We have got the cycle with higher rates and quantitative tightening going on that\u2019s causing those forces to kind of hit us. I would also say that beta move up a bit more than maybe we had planned given the outlook. So we were, I think, in the high 30s prior, maybe we are in the low 40s through the cycle. So we are building that in. You also mentioned that from a liquidity standpoint, I think, we feel very good about that. From that, we are already compliant. If we had -- if we were a Category 3 bank, we are already compliant on the LCR. But from a volume standpoint, we are in rundown in auto, we are looking at some balance sheet optimization initiatives in Commercial and so you will see the LDR fall throughout the rest of the year. And then, finally, I would say that, the other things I look at on the positive side, I mean, our loan betas are from a cumulative standpoint will still exceed cumulatively where we are coming out on deposits. So you will see that mid-to-upper 40s on loans versus the low 40s on deposits. You got front book, back book when the Fed finally kind of pauses and starts to cut. You will see a lot of the balance sheet continue to contribute over the quarters post maybe a possible pause and cut that the Fed may kind of engage in. So lots to...\nBruce Van Saun: Right. You might have add too John about the swaps that we continue to dynamically recalibrate the swaps to provide protection for the event that the Fed ultimately moves lower.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a really good point. I mean when you think that\u2019s that what we are just talking about is the 2023 sort of story. I mean when you get into the end of 2023 into 2024, this cycle compared to last cycle, we have a lot more down rate protection in place for the second half of 2023 and into 2024 than we might have had in prior cycles, Bruce notice.\nBruce Van Saun: This will help support a good guide for 2024.\nJohn Woods: Yeah.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah.\nJohn Woods: Yeah.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. And I guess just to close this off, Erika, I would say, if you look at the outlook for the year, kind of the one thing that got marked down was really NII. We still feel pretty good about the fee outlook. We are going to work a little harder on expenses and probably bring that in below where we thought coming into the year. I\u2019d say credit provisioning should be about kind of where we thought coming into the year. We are still angling to repurchase shares over the course of the year. So our expectation is that we can continue to deliver return on tangible equity in the kind of mid-teen area and just reflective that it won\u2019t make quite as much net interest income this year, but still investing in the things to position us to have a good kind of runway into 2024.\nErika Najarian: Thank you. I will let one of my peers ask more detail on the swap fee calibration, because I think that\u2019s important as we think about NII for 2024, but since we have you, Bruce, I want to ask you about how you are thinking about these anticipated regulatory changes for regional banks. I think that -- I am glad that you said in the prepared remarks that it takes time, right? You have the NPR, which could come out end of the year or a year from now, a year common period has been a phase-in. So as we think about what the market is anticipating, whether it\u2019s TLAC or getting rid of opt out on AOCI, and of course, you said you are already LCR compliant. How are you thinking about managing your capital relative to your stock down at time, right? So it seems like banks can ever buy back as much at the time when they should be buying back and the potential in 2024 for some non-banks to be in bigger trouble and potentially taking market share, but balancing that with what\u2019s going to be potentially tighter requirements on capital and liquidity. How much are you front-loading that versus thinking about the opportunities that can come your way if you remain as profitable as you say you are going to remain?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. Great question. And I guess just to set the big picture, Erika, that I would say, first off, I don\u2019t believe that the answer to the two bank failures is more regulation on regional banks. I think those were idiosyncratic situations and there was sufficient regulation. So you basically had business models that were not well diversified and the banks grew too fast and stretch management capabilities, the supervisors didn\u2019t really do their job and so I think there will be a thoughtful review of what were the issues and then how to address them. I think it\u2019s probable that there will be some tightening around liquidity and capital, and probably, closer reviews of how banks are handling their asset liability management. There may be other aspects of this in terms of the overnight repo facility and creating a kind of viable drain on bank deposits in the money funds and should they change that and deposit insurance and should they take a look at that. So there\u2019s a bunch of things that I think will come under review. Specifically, with respect to us, I think, the good news is that we have managed our capital at the high end of our peer group and so we are already compliant. We would be if we ended up having the AOCI filter removed, we would be in compliance today. The same thing John pointed out, the LCR. We have run that at a high level. We won very rigorous internal liquidity stress testing regimen that we would already be in compliance with the Category 3 bank as well. So the fact that we have managed the balance sheet conservatively, we are already in compliance if they go kind of heavier regulation if it ends up going down that path, I think, we are in good position. So I think we will have and the fact that these will be phased in over kind of, I\u2019d say, two years or three years gives us lots of capital flexibility to be buying back our stock or taking advantage of other situations where that could arise. And if it\u2019s strategically and financially compelling, I think, we have the capability to go on offense. So anyway, that\u2019s kind of my thoughts on that, it was good to kind of stay conservative even when we had lots of questions as to why aren\u2019t you leveraging your capital structure more where you are keeping your CET1 target so high. Guess what? We keep it that way, and we run conservative for precisely these air pockets that you are always going to experience turbulence and high capital and high liquidity is your best friend in these circumstances.\nErika Najarian: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nPeter Winter: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to just follow up on Erika\u2019s question on the NII guide. I was wondering could you be a little bit more specific on the outlook for margin and loan trends going forward?\nJohn Woods: Yeah. I will go ahead and get started on that. So the guide being up 5% to 7%. What we built into that, as we mentioned, is the fact that we are going to have some downward kind of impact on margin coming from the deposit migration, as well as increased beta assumptions that we are building in. So it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty here and a lot of things to play out. But to try to frame it a little bit, go out to -- if you think about where we may end -- 4Q 2023 where we may end the year, we are starting the year at 330. We may end the year, call it, in a wide range, maybe 310 to 320 and if things kind of if there\u2019s good execution and some trends maybe end up going our way, we will end up at the high end of that range, and vice versa on the lower end. And then so I\u2019d say that when you think about playing it out throughout the year, there will be a step down as you work through the year with maybe a little bit of weighting into 2Q and things basically flattening out into the second half of the year. But like I said, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty there and -- but that helps -- hopefully, that will help give you a frame. And then you have got, as we mentioned, on the volume side of things, we do have the auto rundown, which we began last year that will be -- is built into that guide, as well as the ongoing work that we are doing in Commercial and balance sheet optimization. So you put all that together then that gives you the NII guide.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, a good answer, John, that this is an opportunity. We have always been on a balance sheet optimization path. But I think we are really intensifying our focus there. So businesses like indirect auto where it was a good place to kind of part liquidity and we run the business well. We service it very well. But it\u2019s not really that strategically important to us. It doesn\u2019t have direct customers that we cross-sell to, because those customers, frankly, are customers of the dealerships. So looking hard at those business and say, if deposits are more dear, what do we have on the left side of our balance sheet where we don\u2019t have deep relationships and we are not making the best risk adjusted returns. And so during this year, I think we are going to really focus on making sure that the right side of the balance sheet in terms of deposit quality is as strong as it possibly can be and that where we are lending money we are doing that to true customers that we have deep relationships, whether they are Consumer, Small Business or Commercial and so we will take the opportunity this year to potentially have a little bit of a reset and even intensify those efforts. So we will really love our balance sheet going into 2024.\nPeter Winter: Got it. And if I could just ask about deposits, the outlook. I recognize deposits stabilized in March and you have done a lot of work to improve the deposit franchise. But it just seems like in this environment to keep deposits stable to growing deposits from here could be a little bit of a challenge, not only for you. And I was wondering if you could just give some color on some of the deposit opportunities?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. Why don\u2019t I stop at the start at the top and then maybe I will turn it to Brendan and Don to talk about what we are doing in Consumer and Commercial. We did put a slide in their Peter about some of those opportunities. And so, I think that, right now we just need to kind of get through this earnings season and see the cards turned over and continue to trend, hopefully, of less and less turbulence and getting back to a more comp situation. So that\u2019s where kind of stability comes in. And by the way, through -- halfway through April, we are still kind of trending stable to even slightly up. But then the initiatives that we have long invested in and the value propositions that we have both for Consumer and some of the new innovation we have on the Commercial side, we think should start to play out and then we can start to build back deposits. But why don\u2019t I first turn it to Brendan to talk about Consumer.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah. Thanks. So the Consumer -- in the Consumer business have got sort of kind of three segments of deposits, the Traditional Retail, Wealth Management and then Small Business. And it\u2019s kind of progressing as expected, has been chatting mode over the last couple of quarters. We certainly have customers coming into the cycle that have excess deposits and liquidity from pre-COVID. We are seeing very, very small earn down rates, but nothing that is unexpected. And broadly right in line with trends from mid-summer last year through this quarter. As John pointed out, through March, on all three of those portfolios, we saw 60% to 75% increase in inflows, but the same sort of increase on outflows broadly just moving money around it. So we were very stable on net balances across those businesses through the month of March. We feel really good about the underlying health. Over the last eight years, we have invested a lot of time and energy in making our Consumer deposit base much more granular. Our primacy rates, so whether customers consider us a primary bank or not is up dramatically to above peer levels. That\u2019s a good thing. That means stability in low cost deposits when payroll is coming in. We have done things like added benefits like early pay for consumers, which is an encouragement to bring payroll and direct deposit over that\u2019s going quite well adds more granularity and stability of the deposit base. So when I look at levers to continue to have strong deposit performance for the rest of the year. There\u2019s a couple of things in the Consumer Bank that we are really, really focused on. One, John mentioned New York City, New Jersey, household growth, getting more customers. That is going well. We are performing at the top end of our peer set in terms of net market share gain and household growth. We expect that to continue in all of our markets and supported by the really early momentum in New York City and New Jersey that we expect to continue. We have also made a pretty meaningful pivot into customer relationship deepening. So we have rolled out program, as Bruce mentioned, Citizens Plus, which the simple concept is you do more with us, you get more, really encouraging customers to bring more of their wallet to us. We have seen very, very strong take up on that, a 300% plus improvement in customers going into these relationship propositions, encouraged by the breadth of the offering and bringing more to us and profitability of those customers almost doubles when they migrate up. So we think that will give us a shot in the arm as customers look at us to consolidate relationships over. And then maybe last would be Citizens Access. So and it gives us a great lever to raise deposits as we need it, but it also gives us a great lever to cost contain interest-bearing deposits in the Consumer Bank, which will allow us to have much more manageable betas in the core bank where we can focus on relationship banking and not deposit raising for the sake of deposit raising and when we need to contain deposit growth, we can do it in a very targeted way through Citizens Access. That\u2019s proven to be exceptionally effective for us and we had a great quarter in growing Citizens Access here in Q1.\nBruce Van Saun: Don?\nDon McCree: Yeah. So on our side, I think, a lot of it surrounds the Payments and Treasury Services business. You have heard us talk for the last couple of years about the investment we are making in that business. It has not only been around the core operating services, but also a lot of work around deposit franchises and liquidity franchises, frankly. One of the things we haven\u2019t talked about is we have a liquidity advisory service and the liquidity portal, which goes beyond deposits, but allows us to capture customer funds even if they are on balance sheet. And then on the deposit side, over the last couple of years, we have introduced five or six new products. We have talked about the green deposits, talked about carbon offset deposits, we have talked about escrow deposits. So the product sets quite broad. The other thing we saw during the disruptions is we added about 300 new deposit clients, a lot of which interestingly came out of the JMP franchise as they referred some of the technology customers onto our platform. Some of those are funded up. Some of those aren\u2019t funded up. But like Brendan said, the core of our franchise is really the primary core relationships and the operating relationships and about 66% of our deposit base is really with core primary relationships. And the last thing we are doing is we have turned the deposit business into a primary thrust sell. So where we were asking for capital markets business, when the capital markets were, we are now asking for deposits and we are framing the deposit raise in the context and overall relationship and have gotten a very good response from a lot of our clients.\nBruce Van Saun: Great.\nPeter Winter: That\u2019s great.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks.\nPeter Winter: Thank you for the detailed answer.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers: Good everyone. Thanks for taking the question.\nBruce Van Saun: Thanks,\nScott Siefers: I was hoping you might be able to speak at sort of a top level about how Commercial customers are behaving now with their operational deposits, like are they keeping less in operational deposits than they would have previously and then just spreading that money across several banks, which would imply maybe you lose some, but gain on, in other words, higher churn.\nDon McCree: Yeah.\nScott Siefers: Maybe thought what Commercial account openings have looked like over the past month or so?\nDon McCree: Yeah. As I mentioned, we have opened about 300 new accounts over the last month, which has been encouraging. I\u2019d say at the top end of the client base we have seen more diversification activity. So the public companies, which had excess deposits kicking around the system, some of which were search deposits, some of those flowed out and went to other banks and then on the flip side, some of them flowed into us as customers balance their deposit accounts, so kind of net neutral on that. And then the other thing we have seen, frankly, and this is far before SVB and some of the disruption is clients are, because the capital markets are kind of quiet and the lending markets are kind of required, clients are using some of their cash to fund their operations and fund CapEx. So we have seen a little bit of a drift out in terms of just utilization of excess cash balances. And then the -- I\u2019d say, the core operating deposits have stayed pretty flat. I mean people are basically toggling between ECR and deposits, if there\u2019s a toggle, but I\u2019d say, the kind of core funding of operational activities is relatively flat.\nScott Siefers: Okay. Perfect. Sorry, I had missed that 300 accounts over the last month, but I appreciate all that color. And then maybe separately, it sounds like you had some fairly constructive comments about the possibility for investment banking to recover over the course of the year, maybe in the second half. Just maybe a little more color on how you are expecting things to traject from here, please?\nDon McCree: Yeah. I think we will see. It\u2019s going to depend on what happens in the marketplace. I will say that over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a pretty strong bid in a lot of different asset classes, particularly the syndicated loan underlying asset class. So there\u2019s some signs of life in the market, whereas it was dead quiet at the beginning of the year. We are starting to see some transactions actually clear the market some and kind of and some get restructured in ways that are, I would say, not more aggressive, but more regular way from various structured transactions that were happening over the last couple of months. So good signs of life. I\u2019d say our pitch activity and our pipelines are extremely robust. And I would come back to what I said a couple of times is in things like our M&A business, we are a middle-market investment bank and so we play in smaller-sized transactions, say, $250 million to $1 billion, not the $5 billion to $10 billion transactions. So the financing dependency that\u2019s in a lot of our pipelines is not as difficult as it is for the mega transaction. So we think as things begin to stabilize and recover and the rate cycle begins to come to an end, we will see activity in the second half of the year and we are seeing that in our pipeline. And then remember, we also have a very diverse set of capabilities now. So we are doing a lot around private equity, we are doing -- placing equity for clients into, for example, a family office or a lot of pitch activity around convertible bonds. So while some traditional full market products might not be fully back yet, we have a wide arsenal that we are actually deploying on behalf of that.\nBruce Van Saun: And let me just add to that as well and maybe flip it to John. But, Scott, the fee guide is supported, I think, broadly not reliant just on capital markets coming back. So we have a positive outlook across card, across wealth, the cash management business, mortgage, at market. So it\u2019s fairly broad.\nDon McCree: Yeah. Let me just add one more thing, Bruce. So if the first quarter is an indication we were down about $14 million quarter-on-quarter in syndicated finance. We were up about $13 million in our interest rate products and commodities hedging businesses. So diversification of those fee streams to Bruce\u2019s point is quite important.\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah.\nJohn Woods: Yeah. Just picking up on that, so I was going to make that exact point just in terms of the bond and equity diversification along with M&A and cap markets. But in terms of cards, I mean, we do see some positive outlook in card as well, primarily in the credit card space. In mortgage production volumes and margins starting to recover a bit and that\u2019s really good to see after quite a few quarters with headwinds there. And so -- and then on the wealth side of things, that has just been steady for us and is continuing even early April activity has been quite strong and so we are feeling good in the wealth space. So it\u2019s sort of diversified across four, five categories in terms of what we are seeing for the 2023 outlook.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. One moment, please. We are having a technical difficulty. Mr. Cassidy, your line is open. You may proceed.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Hi, Bruce and John.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi.\nJohn Woods: Hi.\nGerard Cassidy: John, you talked about lowering the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet. Can you share with us how quickly you could take -- can take that to neutral if you want -- wanted to as the rate environment shifts possibly towards the second half of the year and then also the cost or the strategies you would use to do that?\nJohn Woods: Yeah. I mean, the way to think about that is, we are pretty close to neutral now and when you are down around 1%, there are a number of assumptions that go into that calculation, including deposit migration, et cetera. And so if your models are off one way or the other, you could easily be neutral. When we think about that when we consider the fact that we have a view that the Fed may hike one more time and may be on hold. But inflation -- if inflation is more persistent and stubborn, things could rise, right, from here. So we nevertheless don\u2019t try to overcook things one way or the other, but gradually getting back to neutral has served us well and so you have to think about that 1% split between what\u2019s typically hedgeable and what is a little less hedgeable and the short end is more hedgeable. So the construct of what short rate exposure is, is actually less than 100%, I am sorry, less than 1%. We are actually 60-40 skewed towards the short end. So to close that down would not take very much at all, would be typically a shift in balance sheet outlook and/or additional resi fixed swaps. But more broadly, we basically layered on a number of transactions to basically get our coverage for the rest of 2023. We have got about $20 billion of coverage in resi fixed swaps for the rest of 2023 and more like $26 million or so for 2024 and so we are sort of thinking of ourselves around neutral with protection to the downside. And I would offer up that, that will result if, in fact, the Fed does at the lower rates by a lot. We have a view that we will end up with a trough NIM that\u2019s well above what we saw in our last cycle. So much more stable and a much more narrow corridor of net interest margin than you might have seen from us in the past.\nGerard Cassidy: Very good. And Bruce, I like the branding you are doing in New York with the Giants, looking forward to the day that Citizens becomes the bank of the Yankees. But with that as a follow-up on retail, this is maybe for Brendan. You guys gave us really good detail on slide 31 on the FICO scores. And a theory out there, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, that the FICO scores have been inflated, because of what we came through during the pandemic, some people claim as much as 70 points. Do you guys buy into that theory, and if so, would you then expect maybe the behaviors of your customers to be different than what the actual FICO scores are?\nBrendan Coughlin: Yeah. Great question. There is a theory out there that FICO scores were inflated with all the stimulus and delinquency going down really fast. The good news is our credit underwriting is fairly sophisticated and while FICO is an input, it tends to be one of about 100 things that we look at, including free cash flow and a whole bunch of other different metrics in all of our businesses. And so we have taken that into account in our underwriting that the range of real FICOs versus actual printed FICOs during COVID was incorporated into all of our credit metrics as we kind of made new loans over the last three years or four years. So we feel really good about that and I think the performance is showing that we think so far, at least we got that right. And as John pointed out, we are seeing the Consumer book normalize, but both delinquency and charge-offs are still south of where they were pre-COVID and we are not seeing an unexpected acceleration of delinquency or charge-offs given the environment really across any of the asset classes. So I know over the years have been questions about some of the businesses that were faster growing in Consumer and unsecured like students that are Citizens Pay business, those are well under control despite the great clubs surrounding us. So we feel really good about where we stand right now for Consumer credit, given the health of the Consumer and the quality of our underwriting standards. And lastly, yeah, we have tightened a bunch in the last six months to nine months just as a cautionary measure. So as we are kind of tightening up on things like auto on just size of balance sheet around the fringes in almost every single one of our asset classes, we have made credit tightenings, not because we are seeing anything we don\u2019t like just in an abundance of caution to make sure that we don\u2019t have any tail risk in any of the portfolios. So as everything we can see right now, we feel pretty good.\nGerard Cassidy: Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open. Go ahead.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Hi.\nJohn Pancari: On the expense side, I think, Bruce, you had alluded to potentially being able to come in below the expense expectation, the 5% expectation may be for the year as you are focusing on that given the topline pressures. Can you maybe give us a little more color there what you are looking at and how material of a potential benefit you could have on that front as you see the topline pressure building on the NII side?\nBruce Van Saun: Yeah. I will start and flip to John. But we had -- coming into the year we were going with a 7% guide, some of that was reflective of the HSBC and ISBC full year effects and then some was the higher FDIC premiums. We have marked that down to 5%. So clearly in recognition that will have some compression in the net interest income. We are going to work really hard to try to protect the bottomline and so I think that\u2019s what we have circled at this point. Clearly, TOP remains an open program and we have lots of ideas in terms of are there other things that we can kind of get working on and actually have a benefit this year. Some of them may actually have a benefit for next year. But, certainly, we have got our folks taking a hard look at what else we can do on the expense side. But at the same time, we are trying to make sure that we protect all of the investments in our future, the important strategic initiatives across Consumer and Commercial, across technology and our overall client experience organization so that when the storm clouds pass we are growing faster than peers and we are in a good position to grow both customer base, as well as our revenues. So that\u2019s the balancing act is to keep looking for efficiencies, while making sure that we are prioritizing the things that really are important to future positioning, John?\nJohn Woods: Yeah. I think that\u2019s well said. I would just add that we are take -- we try to calibrate our expense base along with the revenue base that\u2019s being projected here. And so I think you could very well see an upside in TOP 8 in the coming months. We are working on that. The couple of areas that we are thinking about expanding on is the further simplification of our operating models all of our -- we have taken a look at -- a harder look at all of our third-party spend, reimagining how we operate from an automation perspective is something that structurally we have been making investments in and we can double down on that going forward. And just making sure everything we are doing is absolutely focused on our core objectives of growing a top performing bank, generating low moderate cost deposits and investing in our customers and clients. And so when you put a sharp eye on all of that, you often come up with opportunities to basically create additional efficiencies and we have demonstrated that over the years and then we are going to intensify those efforts here in the coming months.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just secondly, on the commercial real estate front, can you give us a couple of stats that you might you have -- you may have on that in terms of, as you are looking at refreshing or reappraising some of the properties in office. Can you give us what you are seeing in terms of some of the value declines, we had a peer of yours indicate 15% to 20% value decline in some of the office reappraisals? And then, separately, I know you indicated that you are seeing some pressure, you expect pressure on commercial real estate criticized loans. Do you have what the percentage increase was in commercial real estate criticized and what\u2019s the ratio?\nDon McCree: All right. General criticized is running at about 24% for the office space. I don\u2019t have it for the overall real estate book at the time, but office is what we are very focused on. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of appraisals yet, because we are not really in the restructuring mode, the ones we have seen have actually been modestly better than we expected. I don\u2019t have the exact downdraft. But our entry LTVs are around 60%. So there\u2019s a lot of cushion in our underwriting of commercial real estate. As Bruce and John said, we have really staffed up our workout teams and we are really putting each individual property, each individual MSA under the microscope. We are focused on maturities. In the office book, we have about 60% of the book maturing by the end of 2024. So it\u2019s not a huge amount and we have a majority of the risk in the book swapped or fixed in terms of interest rate protection. So while we are beginning to engage client-by-client, remember the way -- we are very kind of focused on who we are doing business with. So client selection is very important. MSA is very important, suburban versus urban is very important and so we think we will have some trouble in the book and we are going to have to restructure a lot of the transactions, it\u2019s going to be very manageable in terms of the overall loss content.\nJohn Pancari: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Due to time constraints, we will now turn the call back over to Mr. Van Saun.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. So, again, thanks everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing slide five. Big picture, first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment. We continue to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives, including the well-executed conversion of the Investor platform in February. For the first quarter, we generated underlying net income of $560 million and EPS of $1.10. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.8%. Net interest income was down 3% linked-quarter given the lower day count and lower interest-earning assets. Our margin was stable at 3.3%. Period-end loans and average loans were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, such as our ongoing runoff of auto. Deposit levels declined in the quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors, the compounding impact of the rate environment and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter. Importantly, our deposit levels were broadly stable during the market turbulence in March. Our quarter end LDR is 89.8% and our liquidity position remains very strong with current available liquidity as of today of about $66 billion. Our credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total net charge-offs of 34 basis points are up 12 basis points linked-quarter, in line with ongoing normalization trends. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $168 million and a reserve build of $35 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.47% up from 1.43% at the end of the fourth quarter, with most of the increase directed to the general office portfolio. Our current coverage ratio is about 17 basis points stronger than our pro forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3%. We repurchased $400 million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio at the top of our target range at 10% and our tangible book value per share is up 6% linked-quarter. Before I walk through the details of the results for the quarter, let me address some of the industry issues that are top of mind on slide six. First, we have a very strong capital base, which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer group, even if one were to include the rate driven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities. We have a quality deposit franchise, which has performed very well since the turbulence, which began in early March. We continue to see the benefit from all of the investments we have made since the IPO with 67% of total deposits from Consumer and a well-diversified Commercial portfolio with about 66% of our clients using us as their primary bank. Finally, 68% of deposits are insured or secured. Our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base, ample available liquidity and strong risk management capabilities. In fact, our LCR level exceeds what would be required as a Category 3 bank at March 31, 2023. Looking at credit, our metrics continue to look solid. Retail is normalizing, but is still performing quite well as the employment picture remains strong. On the Commercial side, our focus is on the CRE portfolio and on general office in particular, which is impacted by back-to-work trends and rising interest rates. We have a very strong reserve coverage of 6.7% on the general office portfolio and I will go through some of the details later. And lastly, the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in March, which in our view, was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader in regulation or management lapses. We will watch closely how things develop, but in any case, we think the process will be thoughtful and deliberate. Finally, we believe we are well positioned for any increase in regulatory requirements, given our diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios. Let's drill into the details on the next few slides, starting with capital on slide seven. We ended the quarter with one of the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group with a CET1 ratio at the top of our target range of 10%. This strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved returns over the medium-term. If you include the rate-driven unrealized loss on debt securities and AOCI, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.7%. If you remove the unrealized losses in HTM, our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by 20 basis points to 6.4%. All of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group again in this quarter. We expect to maintain very strong capital levels growing -- going forward with the ability to generate roughly 25 basis points of capital post dividend each quarter and before share buybacks. We have $1.6 billion of repurchase capacity remaining under our current Board authorization, timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external conditions. Next, I will move to slide eight to discuss our deposit franchise. As you can see, our deposit franchise is skewed towards Consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap. About 67% of our total deposits are Consumer, up from 60% at December 31st, which puts us in the top quartile of our peer group and roughly 68% of our deposits are insured by the FDIC or secured, which is up from 60% at year-end. Demand deposits represent about 26% of the book, down slightly from 27% at year-end as customers have naturally rotated towards higher yielding alternatives. On slide nine, the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear 2022 following the Investors acquisition and the commencement of QT [ph] has been in line with industry performance. We outgrew both the industry and peer average in the second half of 2022. We entered 2023 expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment and we saw a little more of that than we had forecast by about 1% and but most of that happened in January and February. Given our rundown in auto, we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter trying to hold the line on betas. In March, we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry can look to diversify their deposits in the wake of bank failures, but overall, our deposits were broadly stable during the month. This strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the IPO and this will remain a focus as we continue to build a top performing bank franchise. On slide 10, we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our customers. In Consumer, we have developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us. We have strong analytics capabilities and compelling offerings such as Citizens Plus in our Private Client Group, as well as Citizens Access, our digital bank to leverage. And with the final conversion complete at Investors, we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the New York Metro market. On the Commercial side, we have invested heavily in our treasury solutions capabilities with a state-of-the-art platform and strong talent to serve client needs. We continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their cash and drive higher operational deposits, as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits. Moving to slide 11. We are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely given the softening macro environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs. The general office sector is a particular concern as tenants rethink their space needs given the remote work trends. Given these pressures, we are evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. It's worth noting, however, that near 100% of our borrowers are current on their obligations with NPLs under 50 basis points. We are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and have added workout resources, but given the diversity and quality of the portfolio, we feel the credit costs will be manageable. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 2% includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of 6.7%. On slide 12, we drilled down a bit on the $6.3 billion office portfolio, which includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform quite well. The remaining $4.1 billion relates to the general office segment, which we feel is reasonably well positioned across type, geography and suburban areas and central business districts. About 90% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas and the majority is Class A. Next, I will provide further details related to first quarter results. On slide 13, net interest income was down 3%, given lower day count, which was worth about $29 million and slightly lower interest-earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.3% was stable with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs. With debt funds increasing 475 basis points at the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 36% through the end of the quarter. We continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position so that we have down rate protection in the second half of 2023 and through 2026. As we approach the height of the rate cycle, we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly 3% at the end of last year to a more neutral 1.1% at the end of the first quarter. Moving on to slide 14. We posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and higher rates. These showed some resilience in a challenging environment, down 4% linked-quarter with seasonal impacts in capital markets and service charges, partly offset by strength in FX and derivatives revenue and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter and syndications and M&A advisory fees were seasonally lower. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines and signs that deal flow should pick up as the year progresses. Mortgage fees were slightly better with higher production fees as we are seeing volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity. This should continue to benefit margins over time. And finally, card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter. On slide 15, expenses came in better than expected, up only 2.8% linked-quarter, given seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits, as well as the impact of an industrywide FDIC surcharge implemented at the beginning of the year. On slide 16, average loans were down slightly a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of reduced economic activity. Average retail loans are down slightly, reflecting the planned runoff in auto, which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity. On slide 17, average deposits were down $4.7 billion or 2.6% linked-quarter, driven by seasonal and rate-related outflows. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in January and February, with balances broadly stable in March. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 51 basis points, which translates to a 73% sequential beta and a 36% cumulative beta. Moving on to slide 18. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and Commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 12 basis points linked-quarter, which reflects continued normalization. Non-performing loans are 64 basis points of total loans, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in Commercial was offset by improvements in retail. Retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter and continue to remain favorable to historical levels, but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is faring. Turning to slide 19, I will walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $35 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the Commercial portfolio, particularly general office. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.4%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the fourth quarter. The current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as CRE. Moving to slide 20. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our target range. Tangible book value per share was up 6% in the quarter and the tangible common equity ratio has improved to 6.6%. We returned a total of $605 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Shifting gears a bit, on slide 21, we continue to make good progress with our push into the New York Metro market. We were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at Investors in February, which went very smoothly. With that behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities to capture market share. We continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches where customer satisfaction has been improving significantly and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network across the legacy HSBC and Investors branches. We have also seen some good early client wins and a growing pipeline in Commercial. We look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customer focused Retail and Small Business model across the New York market. Moving to slide 22 for a quick update on our TOP 8 program. Our latest TOP program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our TOP 8 program in order to protect returns, as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We will have more to say about this in the coming months. Moving to slide 23. I will walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown with the Fed expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in May and then begin easing late in the year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 3%. Non-interest income is up mid-to-high single digits. Non-interest expense should be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs should remain in the mid-30s basis points. Our CET1 is expected to come in above 10% with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment. Moving to slide 24. As we think about the full year, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and funding position, while sustaining attractive returns. Of course, there is a continued level of uncertainty in the current environment. For the full year 2023, we expect NII to be up 5% to 7%. We are focused on initiatives that will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year. Non-interest income is expected to be up mid-single digits. Non-interest expense is expected to be up about 5%. Net charge-offs are expected to be in the mid-to-high 30s basis points. Our current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and known risks and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down and our CET1 ratio is expected to be above the upper end of our 9.5% to 10% target range. At 10% to 10.25% assuming stable market conditions, our share repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year. To sum up on slide 25, we delivered a solid quarter despite expected -- unexpected challenges and are ready for the uncertainty that lies ahead in 2023. Our strong capital, liquidity and funding position will serve us well to move forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future. Even as we navigate through the current challenging environment, we reaffirm our commitment to our medium-term financial targets. With that, I will hand back over to Bruce. Yeah. Those are the right points to focus on. I'd say you break it down, Erika, between rate and volume. On the rate side, as you heard from, Bruce, we have the migration from a deposit standpoint, you are going to see the full year effect of that, of what's happened over the last quarter or two and the drivers of that are well documented. We have got the cycle with higher rates and quantitative tightening going on that's causing those forces to kind of hit us. I would also say that beta move up a bit more than maybe we had planned given the outlook. So we were, I think, in the high 30s prior, maybe we are in the low 40s through the cycle. So we are building that in. You also mentioned that from a liquidity standpoint, I think, we feel very good about that. From that, we are already compliant. If we had -- if we were a Category 3 bank, we are already compliant on the LCR. But from a volume standpoint, we are in rundown in auto, we are looking at some balance sheet optimization initiatives in Commercial and so you will see the LDR fall throughout the rest of the year. And then, finally, I would say that, the other things I look at on the positive side, I mean, our loan betas are from a cumulative standpoint will still exceed cumulatively where we are coming out on deposits. So you will see that mid-to-upper 40s on loans versus the low 40s on deposits. You got front book, back book when the Fed finally kind of pauses and starts to cut. You will see a lot of the balance sheet continue to contribute over the quarters post maybe a possible pause and cut that the Fed may kind of engage in. So lots to... Yeah. I think it's a really good point. I mean when you think that's that what we are just talking about is the 2023 sort of story. I mean when you get into the end of 2023 into 2024, this cycle compared to last cycle, we have a lot more down rate protection in place for the second half of 2023 and into 2024 than we might have had in prior cycles, Bruce notice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I will go ahead and get started on that. So the guide being up 5% to 7%. What we built into that, as we mentioned, is the fact that we are going to have some downward kind of impact on margin coming from the deposit migration, as well as increased beta assumptions that we are building in. So it's -- there's a lot of uncertainty here and a lot of things to play out. But to try to frame it a little bit, go out to -- if you think about where we may end -- 4Q 2023 where we may end the year, we are starting the year at 330. We may end the year, call it, in a wide range, maybe 310 to 320 and if things kind of if there's good execution and some trends maybe end up going our way, we will end up at the high end of that range, and vice versa on the lower end. And then so I'd say that when you think about playing it out throughout the year, there will be a step down as you work through the year with maybe a little bit of weighting into 2Q and things basically flattening out into the second half of the year. But like I said, there's a lot of uncertainty there and -- but that helps -- hopefully, that will help give you a frame. And then you have got, as we mentioned, on the volume side of things, we do have the auto rundown, which we began last year that will be -- is built into that guide, as well as the ongoing work that we are doing in Commercial and balance sheet optimization. So you put all that together then that gives you the NII guide. Yeah. Just picking up on that, so I was going to make that exact point just in terms of the bond and equity diversification along with M&A and cap markets. But in terms of cards, I mean, we do see some positive outlook in card as well, primarily in the credit card space. In mortgage production volumes and margins starting to recover a bit and that's really good to see after quite a few quarters with headwinds there. And so -- and then on the wealth side of things, that has just been steady for us and is continuing even early April activity has been quite strong and so we are feeling good in the wealth space. So it's sort of diversified across four, five categories in terms of what we are seeing for the 2023 outlook. Hi. Yeah. I mean, the way to think about that is, we are pretty close to neutral now and when you are down around 1%, there are a number of assumptions that go into that calculation, including deposit migration, et cetera. And so if your models are off one way or the other, you could easily be neutral. When we think about that when we consider the fact that we have a view that the Fed may hike one more time and may be on hold. But inflation -- if inflation is more persistent and stubborn, things could rise, right, from here. So we nevertheless don't try to overcook things one way or the other, but gradually getting back to neutral has served us well and so you have to think about that 1% split between what's typically hedgeable and what is a little less hedgeable and the short end is more hedgeable. So the construct of what short rate exposure is, is actually less than 100%, I am sorry, less than 1%. We are actually 60-40 skewed towards the short end. So to close that down would not take very much at all, would be typically a shift in balance sheet outlook and/or additional resi fixed swaps. But more broadly, we basically layered on a number of transactions to basically get our coverage for the rest of 2023. We have got about $20 billion of coverage in resi fixed swaps for the rest of 2023 and more like $26 million or so for 2024 and so we are sort of thinking of ourselves around neutral with protection to the downside. And I would offer up that, that will result if, in fact, the Fed does at the lower rates by a lot. We have a view that we will end up with a trough NIM that's well above what we saw in our last cycle. So much more stable and a much more narrow corridor of net interest margin than you might have seen from us in the past. Yeah. I think that's well said. I would just add that we are take -- we try to calibrate our expense base along with the revenue base that's being projected here. And so I think you could very well see an upside in TOP 8 in the coming months. We are working on that. The couple of areas that we are thinking about expanding on is the further simplification of our operating models all of our -- we have taken a look at -- a harder look at all of our third-party spend, reimagining how we operate from an automation perspective is something that structurally we have been making investments in and we can double down on that going forward. And just making sure everything we are doing is absolutely focused on our core objectives of growing a top performing bank, generating low moderate cost deposits and investing in our customers and clients. And so when you put a sharp eye on all of that, you often come up with opportunities to basically create additional efficiencies and we have demonstrated that over the years and then we are going to intensify those efforts here in the coming months."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yeah. So on our side, I think, a lot of it surrounds the Payments and Treasury Services business. You have heard us talk for the last couple of years about the investment we are making in that business. It has not only been around the core operating services, but also a lot of work around deposit franchises and liquidity franchises, frankly. One of the things we haven't talked about is we have a liquidity advisory service and the liquidity portal, which goes beyond deposits, but allows us to capture customer funds even if they are on balance sheet. And then on the deposit side, over the last couple of years, we have introduced five or six new products. We have talked about the green deposits, talked about carbon offset deposits, we have talked about escrow deposits. So the product sets quite broad. The other thing we saw during the disruptions is we added about 300 new deposit clients, a lot of which interestingly came out of the JMP franchise as they referred some of the technology customers onto our platform. Some of those are funded up. Some of those aren't funded up. But like Brendan said, the core of our franchise is really the primary core relationships and the operating relationships and about 66% of our deposit base is really with core primary relationships. And the last thing we are doing is we have turned the deposit business into a primary thrust sell. So where we were asking for capital markets business, when the capital markets were, we are now asking for deposits and we are framing the deposit raise in the context and overall relationship and have gotten a very good response from a lot of our clients. Yeah. Yeah. As I mentioned, we have opened about 300 new accounts over the last month, which has been encouraging. I'd say at the top end of the client base we have seen more diversification activity. So the public companies, which had excess deposits kicking around the system, some of which were search deposits, some of those flowed out and went to other banks and then on the flip side, some of them flowed into us as customers balance their deposit accounts, so kind of net neutral on that. And then the other thing we have seen, frankly, and this is far before SVB and some of the disruption is clients are, because the capital markets are kind of quiet and the lending markets are kind of required, clients are using some of their cash to fund their operations and fund CapEx. So we have seen a little bit of a drift out in terms of just utilization of excess cash balances. And then the -- I'd say, the core operating deposits have stayed pretty flat. I mean people are basically toggling between ECR and deposits, if there's a toggle, but I'd say, the kind of core funding of operational activities is relatively flat. Yeah. I think we will see. It's going to depend on what happens in the marketplace. I will say that over the last couple of weeks, we have seen a pretty strong bid in a lot of different asset classes, particularly the syndicated loan underlying asset class. So there's some signs of life in the market, whereas it was dead quiet at the beginning of the year. We are starting to see some transactions actually clear the market some and kind of and some get restructured in ways that are, I would say, not more aggressive, but more regular way from various structured transactions that were happening over the last couple of months. So good signs of life. I'd say our pitch activity and our pipelines are extremely robust. And I would come back to what I said a couple of times is in things like our M&A business, we are a middle-market investment bank and so we play in smaller-sized transactions, say, $250 million to $1 billion, not the $5 billion to $10 billion transactions. So the financing dependency that's in a lot of our pipelines is not as difficult as it is for the mega transaction. So we think as things begin to stabilize and recover and the rate cycle begins to come to an end, we will see activity in the second half of the year and we are seeing that in our pipeline. And then remember, we also have a very diverse set of capabilities now. So we are doing a lot around private equity, we are doing -- placing equity for clients into, for example, a family office or a lot of pitch activity around convertible bonds. So while some traditional full market products might not be fully back yet, we have a wide arsenal that we are actually deploying on behalf of that. Yeah. Let me just add one more thing, Bruce. So if the first quarter is an indication we were down about $14 million quarter-on-quarter in syndicated finance. We were up about $13 million in our interest rate products and commodities hedging businesses. So diversification of those fee streams to Bruce's point is quite important. All right. General criticized is running at about 24% for the office space. I don't have it for the overall real estate book at the time, but office is what we are very focused on. We haven't seen a lot of appraisals yet, because we are not really in the restructuring mode, the ones we have seen have actually been modestly better than we expected. I don't have the exact downdraft. But our entry LTVs are around 60%. So there's a lot of cushion in our underwriting of commercial real estate. As Bruce and John said, we have really staffed up our workout teams and we are really putting each individual property, each individual MSA under the microscope. We are focused on maturities. In the office book, we have about 60% of the book maturing by the end of 2024. So it's not a huge amount and we have a majority of the risk in the book swapped or fixed in terms of interest rate protection. So while we are beginning to engage client-by-client, remember the way -- we are very kind of focused on who we are doing business with. So client selection is very important. MSA is very important, suburban versus urban is very important and so we think we will have some trouble in the book and we are going to have to restructure a lot of the transactions, it's going to be very manageable in terms of the overall loss content."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Hey. Thanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. First quarter many unexpected challenges in the environment. Nonetheless, we proved resilient and adaptable and we delivered a solid quarter for our stakeholders. We maintained a strong capital, liquidity and funding position with our CET1 ratio at 10%, our TCE ratio at 6.6% and a solid deposit franchise that skews two-thirds consumer. We have seen the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the month of March. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.10 and return on tangible equity of 15.8%. Our NII was down 3%, reflecting day count impact, slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of 3.3%. Non-interest income and non-interest expense came in broadly as expected, both impacted by seasonality. Our credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our ACL to loans ratio to 1.47%, which was up 4 basis points during the quarter and it's 17 basis points higher than our pro forma day one CECL ACL ratio. We repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter, which reduced our share count by 1.7%. In our slide deck, we tackle head on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about. I will let John run through the details, but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital, liquidity and funding position. We have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group in focusing on a stable consumer oriented and granular deposit base, and in establishing a prudent credit risk appetite and reserve level. While we had some commercial real estate exposure, we feel good about our diversification, the asset characteristics and the borrower quality. CRE criticized assets and workouts will increase during the cycle, but we currently expect losses to be manageable and we have already set aside meaningful reserves. On the regulatory front, it is clear that some changes will occur. Our hope is that the response is thoughtful and appropriate, leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before. In any case, we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process with any provisions likely to be phased in gradually. While much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense, we continue to play prudent offense by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives. We will clearly prioritize deposits, deepening and efficiency initiatives for the balance of 2023. Our New York City Metro integration is progressing extremely well with a successful core conversion of Investors Bank in February and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan. Our outlook for 2023 still shows attractive ROTCE for the full year despite the challenging environment. There's still a great deal of uncertainty, which makes forecasting more difficult, but we remain confident in the strength of our franchise and the ability to weather the storm. We are building a great bank and we remain excited about our future. Our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John? Okay. Thank you, John. Allan, let's open it up for some Q&A. Good morning. Yeah. Let me start and I will quickly flip it to John. But I would say, Erika, that really we are just recognizing what we have seen on -- in the deposit markets and the cost of deposits is going up. I think that was partly a response to kind of the Fed rapid rises and money funds becoming alternatives. So there was, I think, a greater sensitivity around earning a return on cash that kicked in and then that was, I think, further exacerbated by the bank failures in March. And so I think there was kind of heightened velocity of deposits moving around the system and so to retain those deposits, folks had to increase rate paid. We feel that we did a pretty good job here. We came into the year expecting that there would be some seasonal outflows in Q1, and since we had built deposits in the second half of the year and then we had auto running down, so less volume on the asset side, we were prepared to let those run down by about 3.5% in the quarter. We actually saw about 1% higher than that in the runoff, but in any case, we tried to hold the line on betas and I think the betas that we posted are slightly better than peers that have reported at this point. So, but if you kind of play out the rest of the year, we are going to be paying more for our funding than we thought coming into the year and that's pretty much the big driver. I would say there might be kind of a little more disciplined in terms of who we are extending credit to, given I think probably a higher likelihood that we could see a shortened shallow recession. So there might be a little volume impact there from slightly lower earning assets and maybe there's a little mix where we are holding a little precautionary cash. But if I had to kind of put it in order, I would say, number one is the cost of deposits, and maybe slightly the volume on assets, and then thirdly, would be composition. So, John, I will flip it to you. Right. You might have add too John about the swaps that we continue to dynamically recalibrate the swaps to provide protection for the event that the Fed ultimately moves lower. This will help support a good guide for 2024. Yeah. Yeah. And I guess just to close this off, Erika, I would say, if you look at the outlook for the year, kind of the one thing that got marked down was really NII. We still feel pretty good about the fee outlook. We are going to work a little harder on expenses and probably bring that in below where we thought coming into the year. I'd say credit provisioning should be about kind of where we thought coming into the year. We are still angling to repurchase shares over the course of the year. So our expectation is that we can continue to deliver return on tangible equity in the kind of mid-teen area and just reflective that it won't make quite as much net interest income this year, but still investing in the things to position us to have a good kind of runway into 2024. Yeah. Great question. And I guess just to set the big picture, Erika, that I would say, first off, I don't believe that the answer to the two bank failures is more regulation on regional banks. I think those were idiosyncratic situations and there was sufficient regulation. So you basically had business models that were not well diversified and the banks grew too fast and stretch management capabilities, the supervisors didn't really do their job and so I think there will be a thoughtful review of what were the issues and then how to address them. I think it's probable that there will be some tightening around liquidity and capital, and probably, closer reviews of how banks are handling their asset liability management. There may be other aspects of this in terms of the overnight repo facility and creating a kind of viable drain on bank deposits in the money funds and should they change that and deposit insurance and should they take a look at that. So there's a bunch of things that I think will come under review. Specifically, with respect to us, I think, the good news is that we have managed our capital at the high end of our peer group and so we are already compliant. We would be if we ended up having the AOCI filter removed, we would be in compliance today. The same thing John pointed out, the LCR. We have run that at a high level. We won very rigorous internal liquidity stress testing regimen that we would already be in compliance with the Category 3 bank as well. So the fact that we have managed the balance sheet conservatively, we are already in compliance if they go kind of heavier regulation if it ends up going down that path, I think, we are in good position. So I think we will have and the fact that these will be phased in over kind of, I'd say, two years or three years gives us lots of capital flexibility to be buying back our stock or taking advantage of other situations where that could arise. And if it's strategically and financially compelling, I think, we have the capability to go on offense. So anyway, that's kind of my thoughts on that, it was good to kind of stay conservative even when we had lots of questions as to why aren't you leveraging your capital structure more where you are keeping your CET1 target so high. Guess what? We keep it that way, and we run conservative for precisely these air pockets that you are always going to experience turbulence and high capital and high liquidity is your best friend in these circumstances. I would just add to that, a good answer, John, that this is an opportunity. We have always been on a balance sheet optimization path. But I think we are really intensifying our focus there. So businesses like indirect auto where it was a good place to kind of part liquidity and we run the business well. We service it very well. But it's not really that strategically important to us. It doesn't have direct customers that we cross-sell to, because those customers, frankly, are customers of the dealerships. So looking hard at those business and say, if deposits are more dear, what do we have on the left side of our balance sheet where we don't have deep relationships and we are not making the best risk adjusted returns. And so during this year, I think we are going to really focus on making sure that the right side of the balance sheet in terms of deposit quality is as strong as it possibly can be and that where we are lending money we are doing that to true customers that we have deep relationships, whether they are Consumer, Small Business or Commercial and so we will take the opportunity this year to potentially have a little bit of a reset and even intensify those efforts. So we will really love our balance sheet going into 2024. Yeah. Why don't I stop at the start at the top and then maybe I will turn it to Brendan and Don to talk about what we are doing in Consumer and Commercial. We did put a slide in their Peter about some of those opportunities. And so, I think that, right now we just need to kind of get through this earnings season and see the cards turned over and continue to trend, hopefully, of less and less turbulence and getting back to a more comp situation. So that's where kind of stability comes in. And by the way, through -- halfway through April, we are still kind of trending stable to even slightly up. But then the initiatives that we have long invested in and the value propositions that we have both for Consumer and some of the new innovation we have on the Commercial side, we think should start to play out and then we can start to build back deposits. But why don't I first turn it to Brendan to talk about Consumer. Don? Great. Thanks. Okay. Thanks, And let me just add to that as well and maybe flip it to John. But, Scott, the fee guide is supported, I think, broadly not reliant just on capital markets coming back. So we have a positive outlook across card, across wealth, the cash management business, mortgage, at market. So it's fairly broad. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Yeah. I will start and flip to John. But we had -- coming into the year we were going with a 7% guide, some of that was reflective of the HSBC and ISBC full year effects and then some was the higher FDIC premiums. We have marked that down to 5%. So clearly in recognition that will have some compression in the net interest income. We are going to work really hard to try to protect the bottomline and so I think that's what we have circled at this point. Clearly, TOP remains an open program and we have lots of ideas in terms of are there other things that we can kind of get working on and actually have a benefit this year. Some of them may actually have a benefit for next year. But, certainly, we have got our folks taking a hard look at what else we can do on the expense side. But at the same time, we are trying to make sure that we protect all of the investments in our future, the important strategic initiatives across Consumer and Commercial, across technology and our overall client experience organization so that when the storm clouds pass we are growing faster than peers and we are in a good position to grow both customer base, as well as our revenues. So that's the balancing act is to keep looking for efficiencies, while making sure that we are prioritizing the things that really are important to future positioning, John? Okay. So, again, thanks everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks. So the Consumer -- in the Consumer business have got sort of kind of three segments of deposits, the Traditional Retail, Wealth Management and then Small Business. And it's kind of progressing as expected, has been chatting mode over the last couple of quarters. We certainly have customers coming into the cycle that have excess deposits and liquidity from pre-COVID. We are seeing very, very small earn down rates, but nothing that is unexpected. And broadly right in line with trends from mid-summer last year through this quarter. As John pointed out, through March, on all three of those portfolios, we saw 60% to 75% increase in inflows, but the same sort of increase on outflows broadly just moving money around it. So we were very stable on net balances across those businesses through the month of March. We feel really good about the underlying health. Over the last eight years, we have invested a lot of time and energy in making our Consumer deposit base much more granular. Our primacy rates, so whether customers consider us a primary bank or not is up dramatically to above peer levels. That's a good thing. That means stability in low cost deposits when payroll is coming in. We have done things like added benefits like early pay for consumers, which is an encouragement to bring payroll and direct deposit over that's going quite well adds more granularity and stability of the deposit base. So when I look at levers to continue to have strong deposit performance for the rest of the year. There's a couple of things in the Consumer Bank that we are really, really focused on. One, John mentioned New York City, New Jersey, household growth, getting more customers. That is going well. We are performing at the top end of our peer set in terms of net market share gain and household growth. We expect that to continue in all of our markets and supported by the really early momentum in New York City and New Jersey that we expect to continue. We have also made a pretty meaningful pivot into customer relationship deepening. So we have rolled out program, as Bruce mentioned, Citizens Plus, which the simple concept is you do more with us, you get more, really encouraging customers to bring more of their wallet to us. We have seen very, very strong take up on that, a 300% plus improvement in customers going into these relationship propositions, encouraged by the breadth of the offering and bringing more to us and profitability of those customers almost doubles when they migrate up. So we think that will give us a shot in the arm as customers look at us to consolidate relationships over. And then maybe last would be Citizens Access. So and it gives us a great lever to raise deposits as we need it, but it also gives us a great lever to cost contain interest-bearing deposits in the Consumer Bank, which will allow us to have much more manageable betas in the core bank where we can focus on relationship banking and not deposit raising for the sake of deposit raising and when we need to contain deposit growth, we can do it in a very targeted way through Citizens Access. That's proven to be exceptionally effective for us and we had a great quarter in growing Citizens Access here in Q1. Yeah. Great question. There is a theory out there that FICO scores were inflated with all the stimulus and delinquency going down really fast. The good news is our credit underwriting is fairly sophisticated and while FICO is an input, it tends to be one of about 100 things that we look at, including free cash flow and a whole bunch of other different metrics in all of our businesses. And so we have taken that into account in our underwriting that the range of real FICOs versus actual printed FICOs during COVID was incorporated into all of our credit metrics as we kind of made new loans over the last three years or four years. So we feel really good about that and I think the performance is showing that we think so far, at least we got that right. And as John pointed out, we are seeing the Consumer book normalize, but both delinquency and charge-offs are still south of where they were pre-COVID and we are not seeing an unexpected acceleration of delinquency or charge-offs given the environment really across any of the asset classes. So I know over the years have been questions about some of the businesses that were faster growing in Consumer and unsecured like students that are Citizens Pay business, those are well under control despite the great clubs surrounding us. So we feel really good about where we stand right now for Consumer credit, given the health of the Consumer and the quality of our underwriting standards. And lastly, yeah, we have tightened a bunch in the last six months to nine months just as a cautionary measure. So as we are kind of tightening up on things like auto on just size of balance sheet around the fringes in almost every single one of our asset classes, we have made credit tightenings, not because we are seeing anything we don't like just in an abundance of caution to make sure that we don't have any tail risk in any of the portfolios. So as everything we can see right now, we feel pretty good."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg : Thank you, Alan.

And with that, I will hand over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun : Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. We've made good progress on our strategic initiatives, our balance sheet remains strong across capital, liquidity, funding and loan reserves and our profitability has stabilized and is poised to move higher. Let me start with an update on our initiatives. First, the private bank delivered another terrific quarter. We reached $5.6 billion in deposits, up from $4 billion in Q2, and our assets under management reached $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we opened two new private bank offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we added a new private banking team to cover Southern California. We reached breakeven in August and September and expect to be profitable in Q4 with good momentum entering 2025. Next, our commercial bank continues to demonstrate its capacity to serve private capital well. For the quarter, we were number two in the league tables for sponsor leveraged loan arrangements and we remain number one over the past 12 months. We continue to add quality talent to our coverage and our capital markets teams. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to show nice growth. We had 5% year-on-year growth in households and 7% growth in deposits. We look forward to being a key sponsor of the upcoming New York City Marathon as we continue to raise our brand profile in the market. We've executed well on TOP 9, achieving a Q4 run rate benefit of $135 million and we're finalizing the details of TOP 10, which should have a $100 million plus run rate benefit by end of 2025. Our BSO actions continue to proceed as planned. Non-core reduced by $1 billion in the quarter and we continue to use the liquidity generated to pay down higher cost funding like brokered CDs. We continue to execute actions in commercial to exit lending-only relationships and we're focused on our medium-term plan to reduce CRE exposure. With respect to our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio is at 10.6%. Adjusting for AOCI puts us at 9.2%. We repurchased $325 million in stock during the quarter. Our spot LDR was 80.8%, and our Federal Home Loan Bank advances remained low at well under $1 billion. We are not seeing much loan demand, but we remain hopeful this should start to pick up in coming quarters. Our P&L was impacted by the drag from forward starting swaps, which commenced in July as well as some fees that pushed out to Q4. Nonetheless, we did a good job managing expenses and credit is performing broadly as expected. Our Q4 guide shows a nice rebound in both NII and fees, leading to positive operating leverage in the quarter. We expect credit to remain broadly stable and we will continue to repurchase shares. For the full year, we will hit most of our beginning of year guide with the exception of balance sheet volume impacting NII and a modestly higher ACL build. We continue to have strong confidence in our medium-term outlook and we've added to the materials in the appendix to show more detail on our NIM progression. Lots of uncertainty in the environment remains, but we feel good about our capacity to manage through that and continue to execute on our broad strategy. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you've come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods : Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, third quarter saw continued strong execution of our initiatives. And importantly, we believe the third quarter represents a trough in earnings as NIM tailwinds, strengthening fees and continued expense discipline will result in positive operating leverage prospectively. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and capital levels and a healthy credit reserve. This positions us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, which should help drive strong momentum in 2025 and performance over the medium-term. First, I'll start with some highlights of the third quarter financial results, referencing Slides 5 and 6. We generated underlying net income of $392 million for the third quarter, EPS of $0.79 and ROTCE of 9.7%. This includes a negative $0.11 impact from the non-core portfolio, which will continue to steadily run off, creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. The private bank is making strong progress towards profitability reaching breakeven mid-third quarter and we expect it to start being accretive to earnings in the fourth quarter. Our capital position remained strong with CET1 at 10.6% at September 30 and/or 9.2% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and we executed $325 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. We also maintained a strong funding and liquidity profile. Our pro-forma LCR is 122%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100% and our period end LDR is 80.8%. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is down 2 basis points from the prior quarter, given an improved macroeconomic outlook and ongoing front book activity driving a mix shift, which lowered expected loss content in the loan portfolio. We increased our general office reserve to 12.1%, up from 11.1% in the prior quarter. Now I'll talk through the third quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. NII is down 2.9% linked quarter, primarily reflecting lower NIM and slightly lower interest earning assets. With respect to NIM, our margin was down 10 basis points to 2.77%, largely reflecting the impact from the increase in hedge costs as forward starting swaps kicked in during the quarter. Other NIM impacts were largely offsetting. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were down 2.7% linked quarter with seasonality in capital markets and solid card and wealth results. On the heels of a very strong second quarter, our capital markets fees decreased 30% as deal activity slowed given seasonal trends and some M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter. Year-on-year, however, capital markets fees were up 40%, led by bond underwriting and M&A advisory fees. Our client hedging revenue was down slightly as some clients delayed their interest rate hedging plans, given the potential for a faster pace of rate cuts after the Fed eased aggressively in September. Mortgage banking fees are down modestly given the decline in MSR results net of hedging. This was offset by securities gains we took in making adjustments of the investment portfolio. Our wealth fees were up slightly given growth in AUM from the private bank, which was somewhat offset by lower transactional sales activity. We continue to focus on building out our wealth business in both our branch based financial advisory activity as well as in private wealth, where we are adding teams in our private bank office geographies. Total assets under management now approximately $30 billion. On Slide 9, we did a nice job on expenses, which were down 1.3% linked quarter notwithstanding continued investment in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is on target to deliver $135 million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year. And we are planning to launch our TOP 10 program, which will target more than $100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. We will provide more details for you on our next earnings call. On Slide 10. Period-end loans are broadly stable and average loans are down 1% linked quarter, reflecting limited loan demand as well as continued balance sheet optimization. We continue to run down the non-core portfolio to the tune of about $1 billion in the quarter. The core loan portfolio was up about $800 million with solid contributions from the private bank and growth in retail mortgage and home equity. On a period-end basis, the private bank is making good progress with loans up about $630 million to $2 billion. Excluding the private bank, retail loans were up about $750 million, reflecting growth in mortgage and home equity, while commercial loans were down about $580 million, reflecting paydowns driven by corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets, exits of lower returning credit-only relationships and generally lower client loan demand. Next on Slide 11 and 12, we continue to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment. Average deposits are broadly stable with period-end deposits down 1%, driven by the paydown of higher cost treasury deposits tied primarily to non-core rundown. This was partially offset by $1.6 billion of attractive growth in private bank deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 4 basis points linked quarter. However, total deposit costs were up only 2 basis points, while total cost of funds was stable. DDA balances were effectively flat linked quarter with growth in the private bank being offset by lower commercial. We anticipate that migration of lower to higher cost categories will drop off now that the Fed has commenced the cutting cycle. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. Our estimates indicate we ended the upgrade cycle with a terminal interest bearing deposit beta better than the peer average. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 70% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and roughly 68% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. Moving to credit on Slide 13. The net charge-offs rose 2 basis points to 54 basis points, primarily reflecting seasonal impacts in auto. A decline in commercial real estate charge-offs was offset by the resolution of several non-performing credits in C&I. Non-accrual loans increased 10% linked quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in CRE general office, as we proceed with workout actions on a handful of loans. We believe we are near the peak of NPAs as criticized classified loans have been broadly stable for four quarters and loans and workout get resolved. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior quarter, reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and better loan mix given the runoff of the non-core auto portfolio and lower loss content originations in retail, real estate secured and commercial categories. The general office portfolio was down $150 million to $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter and our reserve of $382 million represents 12.1% coverage, up from 11.1% in the second quarter. On the right side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. While rate cuts may be beneficial at the margin, we continue to expect this sector to be challenged. We believe our current reserve represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. So we feel the current coverage is very strong. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $364 million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserve outstanding, this represents an almost 20% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, we have continued to work down the exposure to general office, with the portfolio down roughly $1 billion over the last 18 months to $3.2 billion at September 30, given paydowns of about $600 million in addition to the charge-offs I just mentioned. Moving to Slides 15 and 16. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6%, which compares with 10.7% in the prior quarter. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.2%. Both CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been above the average of our peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $325 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $516 million to shareholders in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 17. Our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank that best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers and our aspiration to build a premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with substantial wealth revenue potential that is set to drive further deposit growth while efficiently managing costs and we are well positioned to continue gaining market share in the important New York metro market. Next, we believe we have built a leading commercial bank among the super-regional banks. We are focused on serving sponsors and middle market companies and high growth sectors of the economy. Our investments over the years in capital markets capabilities and coverage of the private capital space have positioned us well to take advantage when market activity picks up. With the Fed beginning to ease and fears of a recession subsiding, the movement in our commercial client base is decidedly more positive, which has us optimistic that we'll see a strong finish to the year and good momentum into 2025. And we are pleased to report that for the third quarter in a row, our capital markets business sits the top of middle-market lead tables, holding the number one sponsor middle market book runner position on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the private bank. I'm pleased to report that the effort is going very well and continues to gain momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $5.6 billion of attractive deposits. This is a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly 34% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $2 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently announced the addition of a top private banking team in Southern California and we have plans to add new offices in the Bay area, which adds to the offices we've already opened in San Francisco and Mill Valley, California, Palm Beach and Boston. You should expect to see us opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities. Notably, our private bank revenue rose 64% to $49.7 million in the third quarter breaking even by mid-quarter. We are on track for the private bank to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and add meaningfully to EPS next year. Moving to Slide 18. We provide a guide for the fourth quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of November and December. We expect NII to be up about 1.5% to 2.5%, driven primarily by a 5 basis point improvement in net interest margin, reflecting the benefit of swaps given lower rates, deposit repricing, non-core runoff and favorable front book back book dynamics, partially offset by lower asset yields. Spot loans should be up slightly paced by private bank and commercial sponsor activity. Non-interest income should be up mid- to high-single-digits reflecting expected seasonal strength in capital markets. Our deal pipelines are robust and we expect to see a strong finish to the year. We also expect modest improvements across other key categories. Non-interest expense is projected to be up about 2%, and we expect to achieve positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, while the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff and improving loan mix. Our CET1 ratio is expected to be broadly stable with about $200 million to $250 million of share repurchases. I called your attention to an updated slide in the appendix on our medium-term NIM walk, which projects us to be in the 3.25% to 3.4% range in 2027. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic environment with strong results in capital markets, wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We are playing strong defense maintaining a robust capital and reserve position, a high level of liquidity and a more structural long-term funding profile, as we prepare for potential regulatory changes and any challenges the environment may bring. Importantly, we are also playing offense as we pursue our unique multiyear strategic initiatives, which will drive improving performance over the medium-term. We remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun : Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers : I wanted to start off with a couple of questions both related to the margin progression and that medium-term walk to which you alluded on Slide 23, as we kind of start to march upward. Maybe first, in the immediate term, can you sort of walk through the puts and takes that allow for the 5 basis points or so of margin expansion into the fourth quarter? And then, I guess, more importantly, as we sort of start the journey upward and think about that next year or so, it looks like that 18 basis points of time based benefits is largely programmatic, which all else equal would get us to like a 2.95.But of course, the wild cards are like the timing of the ebbs and flows of the swaps and the rate based impact. So maybe if you could sort of help, I guess, narrow the cone on the moving parts as we think about the next few quarters, please?\nJohn Woods : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. I'd say starting off with the fourth quarter. I mean, I think when you think about the progression there, one of the drivers -- several drivers of tailwinds that we're seeing. First off, I would highlight non-core, which continues to contribute about 2 basis points a quarter. And so that's the starting point. I think the second big driver is broadly the active balance sheet management, fixed asset repricing and front book back book that continues to play out on -- will continue to play out every quarter going forward. And that's a huge contributor. I'll offer up one of the highlights of the balance sheet transition as you get into the fourth quarter also relates to deposit migration. We've had negative deposit migration throughout the cycle. That's been kind of declining over time. And we're seeing late third quarter, early fourth quarter trends that tell us that, that's going to flip around to be more of a neutral, maybe a slightly positive going into the fourth quarter. And that's really significant for that to become less of a headwind than it's been. And given what's been going on in the past.\nBruce Van Saun : Just on the color on that let me just jump in here, John. But we have the private bank continuing to generate very attractive deposits and they've been growing well over $1 billion in $1.5 billion range the last two quarters. So that will be positively benefiting that mix. And then typically, seasonally, in the fourth quarter, we'll see an uptick in both commercial and consumer in terms of demand deposits. So we're counting on that as part of the equation.\nJohn Woods : Absolutely. And I think just playing on that a little further. I mean, I think we are -- the other big category, we are slightly asset sensitive, but based on the non-core and those balance sheet trends that we just talked about those are more powerful. And are -- you got to keep in mind that the receipt swaps, which have been a headwind are going to flip over to a tailwind and be a mitigant to our asset sensitivity going forward. So they'll actually contribute into the fourth quarter. And so one of the important things we're also doing is being extremely proactive on down betas. Just taking all the learnings from prior cycles and what you've seen from our deposit portfolio, where our deposit betas on the up are now better than peer average from what we can tell. We're flipping all of that energy and capability into the down beta management being highly proactive in the consumer side of things. And on the commercial side, most of our deposits there are -- the majority of them are 100% beta anyway. But we're feeling really good about how we're really pouncing on this transition to a downgrade cycle. And all of that, when you add all that up, that gives us confidence that we're going to achieve that 5 basis points. And as I may mentioned earlier, the late 3Q trends and the early 4Q trends are very consistent with that trajectory. So that's the 4Q. I think the second -- there are similar themes, but the second question was taken me out to the fourth quarter of 25%. And you're right. If you look at the $277 million in 3Q, you're at the 18 basis points that's really time based, and it's just really baked in. We'll get to $295 million. And there's another, call it, I'd say in the neighborhood of 5-ish basis points of benefit that we can really expect such that we can get in that neighborhood of 3% NIM in the fourth quarter of '25 and the drivers are very similar. The tailwinds related to the growing front book back book. And when you think about our fixed loan portfolio and securities as that turns over under a wide range of rate scenarios, which is more kind of focused on longer end rates where the 10 year is going to end up in five year rates. We end up with anywhere from 200 basis points to 300 basis points of front book back book benefit for as that turns over every quarter, so over the next five quarters, that's a driver that we feel very good about. Our strategic initiatives on the deposit side with respect to private bank at New York Metro continue to contribute. And when you add all that up, we end up with what we think is something nearing 3% by the end of '25 and we still have a lot of down rate protection on. Keep in mind, we've got our swap portfolio is largely intact through the middle of 2026. So, we remain pretty well protected and slightly asset sensitive. But all those other factors offset it and give us a net positive as you get into the end of '25.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes, the one other thing is to the fourth quarter lift and then would add to that target as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor : I guess just to drill down on the net interest income coming in weaker than kind of your thought maybe a month ago. Was that a bigger Fed cut and a little bit less loan growth? And kind of and then all the positive trends that you said is what we should expect from here? Or was there something help to throw out there, too?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'd say we are slightly asset sensitive. So 50, maybe a little bit more kind of than we expected. But I'd say that the deposit trends 3Q, in the trajectory of low-cost migration came down during the quarter, but they may be a little bit than we expected. And so, I think we got to the end of the quarter where we expected, but the average for the quarter in terms of migration was a little higher than we were thinking. But as I mentioned, that is now flipping around and as you look at the late September, early October trends that it was almost -- the bell went off there when the Fed pull the 50 basis point lever, we really are seeing that low-cost migration really flip to more of a neutral to slight positive. And so that's really what you can see going into 4Q.\nBruce Van Saun : And then on volume, too, I think we anticipated a little more loan growth that, I'd say, we had nice loan growth in the private bank, but not maybe quite as much as we thought. I think that's really just timing. And as rates come down that will continue to pick up similarly on commercial bank. We thought we'd see a little faster rebound in line utilization, particularly on the sponsor side. We're starting to see that. So again, I think that's kind of on the come and should -- that's why we have an outlook in the guide that fourth quarter, we should start to see slight growth in our spot loans, even comprehending the non-core rundown.\nMatt O'Connor : And then separately, how do you think about operating leverage kind of more medium-term? Obviously, like net just income could be a bigger driver dollar-wise, if we just look at fourth quarter to kind frame it, you're guiding to revenues up about 3.5% versus costs up to 150 bps of operating leverage, but that's more driven by fees. Just thoughts on medium-term, how much operating leverage would you envision?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean I think we'll talk more about this in January. But I mean, I think we have significant opportunity for operating leverage. When you look at the net interest margin reflating to that $3.25 to $3.40 range provides significant tailwinds and consistent operating leverage over time. We'll come back in January and frame that for you a little more in terms of what we expect in 2025.\nBruce Van Saun : The best thing about the NIM reflation is that there's no real cost of goods sold in terms of the impact on expenses. So that pretty much drops straight through. I think there's clearly going to be continued growth in fees led by capital markets, some of the things we're doing in the payments business, some of the exciting developments in our wealth business but those usually come with payouts and investments on the expense side. But nonetheless, I think the operating leverage should be quite positive when we look out over that 25 to 27 period. Brendan, maybe you could add couple comments.\nBrendan Coughlin : One other comment I mentioned on the private bank is just remember that the cost base that we're working our way through right now is fixed on the short-term basis with the comp guarantees that we've given to the team. So as the revenue grows, we're kind of earning our way through the comp guarantees. So that's all straight positive operating leverage linked quarter where the revenue is coming without necessarily incremental expenses because we've essentially put that in. And then over time, that will work their way through the guarantee and we get the right scale, they'll grow with further linkage together. But right now, it's just straight revenue growth on top of the fixed expense base.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Good point.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.\nJohn Pancari : Bruce, you just talked about the loan growth dynamics a bit. And maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in that you're seeing this inflection in demand here that should drive a modest growth in the fourth quarter. What is the bigger catalyst? Is it the rate cut? Is it clarity you expect around the election? And then -- can you maybe help us think about where like the type of acceleration in overall loan growth that you expect you could see going into -- or as you look at 2025?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Let me start, and then I'm going to pass it to Don and Brendan to talk about their segments and their outlooks. But we're not calling for any heroics here in fourth quarter. So I think the guide is pretty much derisked from meeting significant step up in loan growth. But it is, I think worth noting that we're starting to see things build a bit. We said our biggest quarterly increase in the private bank and the pipeline is looking pretty good. So I think that will continue. And I think there, as rates come down, folks are willing to transact and borrow. I think it's a similar thing in the commercial bank, where there's lots of interest in private equity kind of starting to realize some exits and put some money to work -- that's -- so we see it by the amount of conversations that we're privy to with clients, but it's starting to build. But really, the dam has not broken yet. And so, I think we'll see that trend continue to flex up. But let me start first with Don and then maybe, Brendan, you could pick up a second.\nDon McCree: Yes. I think you said it, Bruce. The leader in the clubhouse is subscription lines, where we saw some very strong growth late quarter and we're continuing to see it into the fourth quarter. And that's not really leveraged by us that we're doing. It's just activity in the private equity space that we're seeing build and we've seen a pretty nice utilization bump in that business. We haven't really seen it in C&I yet, but the conversations we're having with our core C&I clients, particularly in the middle market, with the economy kind of stabilizing rates coming down, it's just a general level of confidence that the business environment is going to be better as we get into '25, and that will result in more working capital utilization, more investment in their businesses. And remember, one of the things John said, one of the downdrafts we've had against kind of core loan growth has been a lot of activity where companies have been refinancing in the public securities markets. So we've seen stuff that's been on our balance sheet being refinanced and good for our fee lines. But it's put a little bit pressure on core asset levels. So -- we think a lot of that is behind us now. So the net growth we'll see in the core book should begin to grow as we get into '25.\nBruce Van Saun : Brendan?\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes, I'll quickly hit on consumer and then private banking. On the consumer side, I just would remind folks at the pace of rundown on non-core is turning into a net positive. So last year, at this time, we were running off $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a quarter and now we're in the consumer book and now we're in the $800 million to $900 million. So that's -- the linked quarter rundown is slowing a bit and that will continue into the future. And when we look at the growth portfolios, we're seeing decent growth in mortgage and home equity. And as rates pull back a little bit, we expect to see a modest pickup in mortgage originations activity. But as everybody knows, the majority of the country is locked into 3%-ish mortgage rates. And so our HELOC business is incredibly well positioned. We've got a real strength in that business where we're the very top of the league tables and national HELOC originations in the super prime space and you'll continue to see that grow. And I believe that product, it will be a main lever for U.S. consumers as the economy gets more confidence in footing for consumers to borrow against record equity in their homes that's been built up over the last five or six years. So we expect that to continue. The other tailwind -- headwind moving to a tailwind is likely student in a modest way with high rates student loan refinance product has been all that sidelined. And now with the federal government not collecting payments again on that portfolio and rates coming back down, we should see more late 20s, early 30 year olds who have great credit coming back in the money that see value in restructuring their student loan debt. So we're expecting that to modestly pick up, as we get into next year. On the private bank side, it's a little bit of the same story. Rates pulling back should really put more customers an attractive place to use credit. And right now, we're seeing a lot of cash transactions, whether it's on the resi side or business is sitting on the sidelines and we're hearing very strong feedback. But as rates pull back, they'll be more comfortable using credit versus just going cash temporarily on whether it's an investment home or facilitating business growth given that high net worth and ultrahigh net profile of that customer base. So we've got good confidence that the rate dynamic should drive a decent amount of embedded demand. And as everybody knows, we've also went to market very strong on the deposit side. We've been very focused on getting the operations up. There's a progression here on earning the customer's full wallet of do the day-to-day banking really well. Now they'll come from borrowing needs and then we'll build a dislodge well. So there's a natural sort of earned wallet share gain that we anticipate getting as we get into next year on the private banking side that will be supported by the rate environment.\nJohn Pancari : And then a quick second one on credit. Can you just talk about the confidence that I believe you indicated that you've seen, you believe NPAs are peaking here this quarter. Maybe your confidence there, what gives you that? And then also on the confidence in the broadly stable charge-offs with the third quarter as you look at fourth quarter. I know your auto delinquencies were up pretty sharply year-over-year. So that would be beyond the seasonality. So I'm interested in what drove that and then thoughts on the reserve going forward?\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then we'll pass it around whoever wants to jump in, feel free. But yes, I'd say the big issue that's well known that we've been managing through is the general office portfolio. And that one is going to -- it's a multi-quarter workout that has commenced in '23, it's with us all through '24. It will be with us for a good chunk of 25%. And we think we've got our arms fully around that. We've got very heavy reserves there. We've got our best people working with borrowers to try to come up with mutually satisfactory outcomes. But the timing of when you recognize the charge-offs and when something might go NPA moves around a bit and it's not always in our control. If a borrower decides to put a property up for sale then there are certain actions we have to take in terms of NPA recognition or charge-off recognition. So this quarter, we were on the low end of CRE charge-offs and we had a blip in CRE NPAs. But having said that the problem loan population that we're managing is pretty consistent. And so one of the things we take comfort in is when we look at criticized and classified loans across the board in commercial, they've been pretty stable now for four quarters. So that's the big thing. I'll see, Don, if you want to add any color on the CRE and then Brendan, if anything on the delinquencies.\nDon McCree : I think that's exactly right, Bruce. I think that we've seen like zero surprises in our credit book for the last four quarters, and it's playing out exactly as we thought it was going to play out. And as Bruce said, we'll have charge-offs going through the general office portfolio for the next several quarters, but it's pretty much playing out as we expected. We had a little bit of a blip in C&I charge-off this quarter, which was things that have been in the workout teams for literally five, six, seven years, and they just happened to resolve this quarter. So I don't worry a lot about NPA moves, what I focus on is the class levels and the fact that those have been stable. The other thing we're seeing in the general real estate area is not in general office, but in general real estate. There's a lot of liquidity coming back into the marketplace. So it's accelerating our ability to move down the overall exposures in the book, which you know is a strategic matter or something that I want to do. And we're seeing nothing in the C&I book and broadly that is disturbing to us at all, that's quite healthy from an overall credit standpoint.\nBrendan Coughlin : Yes. Consumer is broadly normalized and pre-COVID we're between 50 basis points and 55 basis points in net charge-offs. And that's where we are now. And while there's always a little bit of puts and takes. There's nothing that we're observing in the portfolio that's making me lose any sleep. And your question on auto, a couple of comments. One would be -- last quarter was -- on the charge-off side was very low, seasonally impacted, but also we had a very strong recovery month in used value. So this quarter was much more just a reversion to the mean. The other dynamic I would mention in auto, it's tough to read into published delinquency numbers, even though delinquency is relatively in check. But when you're not originating anymore, it takes 12 months to 18 months for a vintage curve to build up to its appropriate steady state and delinquency. So when you shut the pick it off on new originations, it's just a denominator issue that you've got other origination vintages that are normally progressing along their lines to our ultimate expected loss number and you're not getting the denominator benefit of a bunch of new flow coming in that has zero delinquencies. So when you decompose all that there's really nothing that we're worried about whatsoever in the auto portfolio. It's performing exactly as we priced it and exactly as we've expected it to.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.\nErika Najarian : My first question is for you, John. On the 10-Q, you had $30 billion of notional received fixed peso for swaps for both 3Q and 4Q and $30.9 billion for 2025. Obviously, Slide 24 would indicate lower notionals. Could you give us an update on whether you terminated those swaps. And maybe confirm the accounting for the swaps and that you would just -- those losses are crystallized and they would be in your NII for the duration of the swap life and then just as a follow-up, you mentioned a 3% NIM by 4Q '25. How many rate cuts would you need to ensure yourself of getting to that 3% level?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I'll take those. So yes, I think during the third quarter, as you may recall, there was a period of time when the yield curve was discounting as many as seven or eight cuts over -- through the second quarter of next year was pretty aggressive, expectation of the pace of Fed rate cuts. We happen to have about $4 billion of short-dated receive-fixed swaps that were maturing in May of '25. And so what we opportunistically chose to do was to terminate $4 billion of swaps during the third quarter in an environment where there was approximately seven or eight cuts that we locked in that benefit, given the swaps are very short dated and really, we're only providing down rate protection through May, we felt like that was a good risk reward to lock in that benefit and lock in the contribution and protection against lower rates that the swaps were there to cover in the first place. Out the window, there are fewer cuts through May. So at least at this point, that was a round trip positive for us to move on from those swaps and they did exactly what they were intended to do, was to create that protection. The accounting aspects of it are that we amortize the impact of that over the remaining life of the swaps through May. So that will be amortized through but that impact will be, again, a lower impact or a more favorable impact than otherwise would be the case that we were to have held the swaps. And so that was the point of the terminations. So that's that one. And I think the second question was about 3% -- how many cuts. And the rate environment that we would -- there's a range of rate environments that would still be consistent. With that I mean I would say that we have a slightly asset sensitive position. So net interest margin is stable across a range of rate environments into '25 given the swap portfolio, it doesn't begin to drop off until mid-2026. So I mean, the forward curve out the window implies getting to around 350 by the end of '25, but we would be able to achieve that 3% at rate environments that would be below that level as well.\nErika Najarian : And my follow-up question is two-fold. First, could you explain the more favorable impact? I think I was thinking that as I amortize that impact of the terminated swap, it would just be the difference between the SOFR and received fixed rate through May 2025. So John, maybe give us some insight on what the more favorable treatment would be? And then just secondly, I just wanted to follow-up. I think that there are a lot of questions over being able to achieve that NIM expansion for next quarter, which you've explained well. I just wanted to sort of nail down what kind of deposit beta you are assuming in that 2.82% number for next quarter?\nJohn Woods : Yes. So again, so when you terminate the swap, you basically terminate based upon the forward curve that's assumed at the time. And so the forward curve at that.\nErika Najarian : That's the difference. Got it.\nJohn Woods : And then on the NIM expansion into the fourth quarter, highly proactive focus on this is going to get our deposit beta to be up to around nearing 40% by the end of the quarter. You've got all of the 100% beta stuff in commercial leading the way, but we're being highly proactive in consumer as well and just really taking all the learnings over the cycle over the last many years and applying that to how we continue to be able to drive solid deposit growth at a really attractive cost of funds. So that's the number that's baked in about 40% deposit beta in 4Q.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley.\nManan Gosalia : I wanted to follow-up on the deposit beta question. Do you have any more specifics on what your spot deposit rates are now that we're a month past the Fed rate cut how you expect that deposit beta to traject as we get further into the Fed rate cut cycle, right? So as we get -- as we get as more Fed rate cuts are behind us, does that make it easier or more difficult to continue to drop your deposit rates going forward?\nJohn Woods : I mean I think if you kind of do the math there, if you -- based on the forward -- from the forward curve that we'll have two more Fed cuts in 4Q and we're using a curve that was after non-farm payrolls from a week or two ago. But after non-farm payrolls, you've got the 2 cuts. Based on that curve, and if you apply a 40% beta to what you think the average SOFR rate would be in 4Q versus 3Q, you can come up with the decline in net interest-bearing deposit costs on that basis. And second question, what was the second part of that question?\nManan Gosalia : The second part of the question was just as we get into -- as we get into, say, the middle of next year and we have a series of Fed rate cuts behind us. Does that make it easier to continue to drop deposit rates? Or does it make it harder to drop deposit rates because there's fewer cuts in the forward curve front there?\nJohn Woods : I think the way to think about that is the longer the down cycle lasts, the more you can continue to contribute to ongoing lowering of deposit costs, but broadly, I think what we've said in the past was that our down cycle betas are going to approximate our cycle, so around 50% to 55%. And so we're going to be around 40% by the end of the fourth quarter, and it will gradually migrate to that 50% to 55% over the cutting cycle that's going to proceed over the -- in the coming years. And so you can kind of think about that gradual improvement in that way, I think.\nBruce Van Saun : Yes. But there was acceleration in the up cycle towards the later part of the cycle, which I think you mirror that on the downside.\nManan Gosalia : That's what I was getting to. That's really helpful. And then maybe just on the front book back book, I think you noted the 200 basis point to 300 basis point spread benefit. Can you talk about what balances we should apply that to? What are the fixed rate securities and loans coming due over the next year or so? And is there any room to use some of the excess capital for any securities positioning from here?\nJohn Woods : Yes. I mean I think that's a good metric to use that this will be growing over time. So when you see when you see the activity and loan growth picking up over time, you're going to see this being a contributor over the next couple of years. I mean, I'd say that the what turns over in the back book quarterly basis in resi mortgage, call it around $750 million a quarter and that's a similar number for securities as well. When you talk about what turns over those are the balances that you would apply it to is the front book, back book, but that will continue to contribute and build on itself over the next couple of years.\nManan Gosalia : That's right. And would you do as securities repositioning from here? Is there any room to that?\nJohn Woods : I mean that's not in our plans. I mean we'll look at -- we actively manage the securities portfolio and we -- on an ongoing basis but we don't have a large single repositioning.\nBruce Van Saun : And I would also just point to Slide 23 and some of the built-in momentum that we have to raise NIM, so that the need to expend capital to shift the timing on that NIM walk is not something that we need to avail ourselves of.\nOperator: And at this time, you have no further questions in queue.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Great. Well, thanks again, folks for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support in Citizens. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, third quarter saw continued strong execution of our initiatives. And importantly, we believe the third quarter represents a trough in earnings as NIM tailwinds, strengthening fees and continued expense discipline will result in positive operating leverage prospectively. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with excellent liquidity and capital levels and a healthy credit reserve. This positions us well to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives, which should help drive strong momentum in 2025 and performance over the medium-term. First, I'll start with some highlights of the third quarter financial results, referencing Slides 5 and 6. We generated underlying net income of $392 million for the third quarter, EPS of $0.79 and ROTCE of 9.7%. This includes a negative $0.11 impact from the non-core portfolio, which will continue to steadily run off, creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. The private bank is making strong progress towards profitability reaching breakeven mid-third quarter and we expect it to start being accretive to earnings in the fourth quarter. Our capital position remained strong with CET1 at 10.6% at September 30 and/or 9.2% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal and we executed $325 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. We also maintained a strong funding and liquidity profile. Our pro-forma LCR is 122%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100% and our period end LDR is 80.8%. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is down 2 basis points from the prior quarter, given an improved macroeconomic outlook and ongoing front book activity driving a mix shift, which lowered expected loss content in the loan portfolio. We increased our general office reserve to 12.1%, up from 11.1% in the prior quarter. Now I'll talk through the third quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. NII is down 2.9% linked quarter, primarily reflecting lower NIM and slightly lower interest earning assets. With respect to NIM, our margin was down 10 basis points to 2.77%, largely reflecting the impact from the increase in hedge costs as forward starting swaps kicked in during the quarter. Other NIM impacts were largely offsetting. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were down 2.7% linked quarter with seasonality in capital markets and solid card and wealth results. On the heels of a very strong second quarter, our capital markets fees decreased 30% as deal activity slowed given seasonal trends and some M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter. Year-on-year, however, capital markets fees were up 40%, led by bond underwriting and M&A advisory fees. Our client hedging revenue was down slightly as some clients delayed their interest rate hedging plans, given the potential for a faster pace of rate cuts after the Fed eased aggressively in September. Mortgage banking fees are down modestly given the decline in MSR results net of hedging. This was offset by securities gains we took in making adjustments of the investment portfolio. Our wealth fees were up slightly given growth in AUM from the private bank, which was somewhat offset by lower transactional sales activity. We continue to focus on building out our wealth business in both our branch based financial advisory activity as well as in private wealth, where we are adding teams in our private bank office geographies. Total assets under management now approximately $30 billion. On Slide 9, we did a nice job on expenses, which were down 1.3% linked quarter notwithstanding continued investment in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is on target to deliver $135 million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year. And we are planning to launch our TOP 10 program, which will target more than $100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. We will provide more details for you on our next earnings call. On Slide 10. Period-end loans are broadly stable and average loans are down 1% linked quarter, reflecting limited loan demand as well as continued balance sheet optimization. We continue to run down the non-core portfolio to the tune of about $1 billion in the quarter. The core loan portfolio was up about $800 million with solid contributions from the private bank and growth in retail mortgage and home equity. On a period-end basis, the private bank is making good progress with loans up about $630 million to $2 billion. Excluding the private bank, retail loans were up about $750 million, reflecting growth in mortgage and home equity, while commercial loans were down about $580 million, reflecting paydowns driven by corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets, exits of lower returning credit-only relationships and generally lower client loan demand. Next on Slide 11 and 12, we continue to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment. Average deposits are broadly stable with period-end deposits down 1%, driven by the paydown of higher cost treasury deposits tied primarily to non-core rundown. This was partially offset by $1.6 billion of attractive growth in private bank deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 4 basis points linked quarter. However, total deposit costs were up only 2 basis points, while total cost of funds was stable. DDA balances were effectively flat linked quarter with growth in the private bank being offset by lower commercial. We anticipate that migration of lower to higher cost categories will drop off now that the Fed has commenced the cutting cycle. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. Our estimates indicate we ended the upgrade cycle with a terminal interest bearing deposit beta better than the peer average. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 70% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and roughly 68% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. Moving to credit on Slide 13. The net charge-offs rose 2 basis points to 54 basis points, primarily reflecting seasonal impacts in auto. A decline in commercial real estate charge-offs was offset by the resolution of several non-performing credits in C&I. Non-accrual loans increased 10% linked quarter, primarily reflecting an increase in CRE general office, as we proceed with workout actions on a handful of loans. We believe we are near the peak of NPAs as criticized classified loans have been broadly stable for four quarters and loans and workout get resolved. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point decline from the prior quarter, reflecting an improving macroeconomic outlook and better loan mix given the runoff of the non-core auto portfolio and lower loss content originations in retail, real estate secured and commercial categories. The general office portfolio was down $150 million to $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter and our reserve of $382 million represents 12.1% coverage, up from 11.1% in the second quarter. On the right side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. While rate cuts may be beneficial at the margin, we continue to expect this sector to be challenged. We believe our current reserve represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. So we feel the current coverage is very strong. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $364 million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserve outstanding, this represents an almost 20% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, we have continued to work down the exposure to general office, with the portfolio down roughly $1 billion over the last 18 months to $3.2 billion at September 30, given paydowns of about $600 million in addition to the charge-offs I just mentioned. Moving to Slides 15 and 16. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6%, which compares with 10.7% in the prior quarter. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio increased from 9% to 9.2%. Both CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been above the average of our peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $325 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $516 million to shareholders in the third quarter. Moving to Slide 17. Our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank that best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers and our aspiration to build a premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with substantial wealth revenue potential that is set to drive further deposit growth while efficiently managing costs and we are well positioned to continue gaining market share in the important New York metro market. Next, we believe we have built a leading commercial bank among the super-regional banks. We are focused on serving sponsors and middle market companies and high growth sectors of the economy. Our investments over the years in capital markets capabilities and coverage of the private capital space have positioned us well to take advantage when market activity picks up. With the Fed beginning to ease and fears of a recession subsiding, the movement in our commercial client base is decidedly more positive, which has us optimistic that we'll see a strong finish to the year and good momentum into 2025. And we are pleased to report that for the third quarter in a row, our capital markets business sits the top of middle-market lead tables, holding the number one sponsor middle market book runner position on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving to the private bank. I'm pleased to report that the effort is going very well and continues to gain momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $5.6 billion of attractive deposits. This is a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly 34% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $2 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently announced the addition of a top private banking team in Southern California and we have plans to add new offices in the Bay area, which adds to the offices we've already opened in San Francisco and Mill Valley, California, Palm Beach and Boston. You should expect to see us opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities. Notably, our private bank revenue rose 64% to $49.7 million in the third quarter breaking even by mid-quarter. We are on track for the private bank to start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and add meaningfully to EPS next year. Moving to Slide 18. We provide a guide for the fourth quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of November and December. We expect NII to be up about 1.5% to 2.5%, driven primarily by a 5 basis point improvement in net interest margin, reflecting the benefit of swaps given lower rates, deposit repricing, non-core runoff and favorable front book back book dynamics, partially offset by lower asset yields. Spot loans should be up slightly paced by private bank and commercial sponsor activity. Non-interest income should be up mid- to high-single-digits reflecting expected seasonal strength in capital markets. Our deal pipelines are robust and we expect to see a strong finish to the year. We also expect modest improvements across other key categories. Non-interest expense is projected to be up about 2%, and we expect to achieve positive operating leverage. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, while the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff and improving loan mix. Our CET1 ratio is expected to be broadly stable with about $200 million to $250 million of share repurchases. I called your attention to an updated slide in the appendix on our medium-term NIM walk, which projects us to be in the 3.25% to 3.4% range in 2027. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter in a dynamic environment with strong results in capital markets, wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We are playing strong defense maintaining a robust capital and reserve position, a high level of liquidity and a more structural long-term funding profile, as we prepare for potential regulatory changes and any challenges the environment may bring. Importantly, we are also playing offense as we pursue our unique multiyear strategic initiatives, which will drive improving performance over the medium-term. We remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Scott. I'd say starting off with the fourth quarter. I mean, I think when you think about the progression there, one of the drivers -- several drivers of tailwinds that we're seeing. First off, I would highlight non-core, which continues to contribute about 2 basis points a quarter. And so that's the starting point. I think the second big driver is broadly the active balance sheet management, fixed asset repricing and front book back book that continues to play out on -- will continue to play out every quarter going forward. And that's a huge contributor. I'll offer up one of the highlights of the balance sheet transition as you get into the fourth quarter also relates to deposit migration. We've had negative deposit migration throughout the cycle. That's been kind of declining over time. And we're seeing late third quarter, early fourth quarter trends that tell us that, that's going to flip around to be more of a neutral, maybe a slightly positive going into the fourth quarter. And that's really significant for that to become less of a headwind than it's been. And given what's been going on in the past. Absolutely. And I think just playing on that a little further. I mean, I think we are -- the other big category, we are slightly asset sensitive, but based on the non-core and those balance sheet trends that we just talked about those are more powerful. And are -- you got to keep in mind that the receipt swaps, which have been a headwind are going to flip over to a tailwind and be a mitigant to our asset sensitivity going forward. So they'll actually contribute into the fourth quarter. And so one of the important things we're also doing is being extremely proactive on down betas. Just taking all the learnings from prior cycles and what you've seen from our deposit portfolio, where our deposit betas on the up are now better than peer average from what we can tell. We're flipping all of that energy and capability into the down beta management being highly proactive in the consumer side of things. And on the commercial side, most of our deposits there are -- the majority of them are 100% beta anyway. But we're feeling really good about how we're really pouncing on this transition to a downgrade cycle. And all of that, when you add all that up, that gives us confidence that we're going to achieve that 5 basis points. And as I may mentioned earlier, the late 3Q trends and the early 4Q trends are very consistent with that trajectory. So that's the 4Q. I think the second -- there are similar themes, but the second question was taken me out to the fourth quarter of 25%. And you're right. If you look at the $277 million in 3Q, you're at the 18 basis points that's really time based, and it's just really baked in. We'll get to $295 million. And there's another, call it, I'd say in the neighborhood of 5-ish basis points of benefit that we can really expect such that we can get in that neighborhood of 3% NIM in the fourth quarter of '25 and the drivers are very similar. The tailwinds related to the growing front book back book. And when you think about our fixed loan portfolio and securities as that turns over under a wide range of rate scenarios, which is more kind of focused on longer end rates where the 10 year is going to end up in five year rates. We end up with anywhere from 200 basis points to 300 basis points of front book back book benefit for as that turns over every quarter, so over the next five quarters, that's a driver that we feel very good about. Our strategic initiatives on the deposit side with respect to private bank at New York Metro continue to contribute. And when you add all that up, we end up with what we think is something nearing 3% by the end of '25 and we still have a lot of down rate protection on. Keep in mind, we've got our swap portfolio is largely intact through the middle of 2026. So, we remain pretty well protected and slightly asset sensitive. But all those other factors offset it and give us a net positive as you get into the end of '25. Yes. I'd say we are slightly asset sensitive. So 50, maybe a little bit more kind of than we expected. But I'd say that the deposit trends 3Q, in the trajectory of low-cost migration came down during the quarter, but they may be a little bit than we expected. And so, I think we got to the end of the quarter where we expected, but the average for the quarter in terms of migration was a little higher than we were thinking. But as I mentioned, that is now flipping around and as you look at the late September, early October trends that it was almost -- the bell went off there when the Fed pull the 50 basis point lever, we really are seeing that low-cost migration really flip to more of a neutral to slight positive. And so that's really what you can see going into 4Q. Yes. I mean I think we'll talk more about this in January. But I mean, I think we have significant opportunity for operating leverage. When you look at the net interest margin reflating to that $3.25 to $3.40 range provides significant tailwinds and consistent operating leverage over time. We'll come back in January and frame that for you a little more in terms of what we expect in 2025. Yes. I'll take those. So yes, I think during the third quarter, as you may recall, there was a period of time when the yield curve was discounting as many as seven or eight cuts over -- through the second quarter of next year was pretty aggressive, expectation of the pace of Fed rate cuts. We happen to have about $4 billion of short-dated receive-fixed swaps that were maturing in May of '25. And so what we opportunistically chose to do was to terminate $4 billion of swaps during the third quarter in an environment where there was approximately seven or eight cuts that we locked in that benefit, given the swaps are very short dated and really, we're only providing down rate protection through May, we felt like that was a good risk reward to lock in that benefit and lock in the contribution and protection against lower rates that the swaps were there to cover in the first place. Out the window, there are fewer cuts through May. So at least at this point, that was a round trip positive for us to move on from those swaps and they did exactly what they were intended to do, was to create that protection. The accounting aspects of it are that we amortize the impact of that over the remaining life of the swaps through May. So that will be amortized through but that impact will be, again, a lower impact or a more favorable impact than otherwise would be the case that we were to have held the swaps. And so that was the point of the terminations. So that's that one. And I think the second question was about 3% -- how many cuts. And the rate environment that we would -- there's a range of rate environments that would still be consistent. With that I mean I would say that we have a slightly asset sensitive position. So net interest margin is stable across a range of rate environments into '25 given the swap portfolio, it doesn't begin to drop off until mid-2026. So I mean, the forward curve out the window implies getting to around 350 by the end of '25, but we would be able to achieve that 3% at rate environments that would be below that level as well. Yes. So again, so when you terminate the swap, you basically terminate based upon the forward curve that's assumed at the time. And so the forward curve at that. And then on the NIM expansion into the fourth quarter, highly proactive focus on this is going to get our deposit beta to be up to around nearing 40% by the end of the quarter. You've got all of the 100% beta stuff in commercial leading the way, but we're being highly proactive in consumer as well and just really taking all the learnings over the cycle over the last many years and applying that to how we continue to be able to drive solid deposit growth at a really attractive cost of funds. So that's the number that's baked in about 40% deposit beta in 4Q. I mean I think if you kind of do the math there, if you -- based on the forward -- from the forward curve that we'll have two more Fed cuts in 4Q and we're using a curve that was after non-farm payrolls from a week or two ago. But after non-farm payrolls, you've got the 2 cuts. Based on that curve, and if you apply a 40% beta to what you think the average SOFR rate would be in 4Q versus 3Q, you can come up with the decline in net interest-bearing deposit costs on that basis. And second question, what was the second part of that question? I think the way to think about that is the longer the down cycle lasts, the more you can continue to contribute to ongoing lowering of deposit costs, but broadly, I think what we've said in the past was that our down cycle betas are going to approximate our cycle, so around 50% to 55%. And so we're going to be around 40% by the end of the fourth quarter, and it will gradually migrate to that 50% to 55% over the cutting cycle that's going to proceed over the -- in the coming years. And so you can kind of think about that gradual improvement in that way, I think. Yes. I mean I think that's a good metric to use that this will be growing over time. So when you see when you see the activity and loan growth picking up over time, you're going to see this being a contributor over the next couple of years. I mean, I'd say that the what turns over in the back book quarterly basis in resi mortgage, call it around $750 million a quarter and that's a similar number for securities as well. When you talk about what turns over those are the balances that you would apply it to is the front book, back book, but that will continue to contribute and build on itself over the next couple of years. I mean that's not in our plans. I mean we'll look at -- we actively manage the securities portfolio and we -- on an ongoing basis but we don't have a large single repositioning."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes. I think you said it, Bruce. The leader in the clubhouse is subscription lines, where we saw some very strong growth late quarter and we're continuing to see it into the fourth quarter. And that's not really leveraged by us that we're doing. It's just activity in the private equity space that we're seeing build and we've seen a pretty nice utilization bump in that business. We haven't really seen it in C&I yet, but the conversations we're having with our core C&I clients, particularly in the middle market, with the economy kind of stabilizing rates coming down, it's just a general level of confidence that the business environment is going to be better as we get into '25, and that will result in more working capital utilization, more investment in their businesses. And remember, one of the things John said, one of the downdrafts we've had against kind of core loan growth has been a lot of activity where companies have been refinancing in the public securities markets. So we've seen stuff that's been on our balance sheet being refinanced and good for our fee lines. But it's put a little bit pressure on core asset levels. So -- we think a lot of that is behind us now. So the net growth we'll see in the core book should begin to grow as we get into '25. I think that's exactly right, Bruce. I think that we've seen like zero surprises in our credit book for the last four quarters, and it's playing out exactly as we thought it was going to play out. And as Bruce said, we'll have charge-offs going through the general office portfolio for the next several quarters, but it's pretty much playing out as we expected. We had a little bit of a blip in C&I charge-off this quarter, which was things that have been in the workout teams for literally five, six, seven years, and they just happened to resolve this quarter. So I don't worry a lot about NPA moves, what I focus on is the class levels and the fact that those have been stable. The other thing we're seeing in the general real estate area is not in general office, but in general real estate. There's a lot of liquidity coming back into the marketplace. So it's accelerating our ability to move down the overall exposures in the book, which you know is a strategic matter or something that I want to do. And we're seeing nothing in the C&I book and broadly that is disturbing to us at all, that's quite healthy from an overall credit standpoint."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. We've made good progress on our strategic initiatives, our balance sheet remains strong across capital, liquidity, funding and loan reserves and our profitability has stabilized and is poised to move higher. Let me start with an update on our initiatives. First, the private bank delivered another terrific quarter. We reached $5.6 billion in deposits, up from $4 billion in Q2, and our assets under management reached $4.1 billion. During the quarter, we opened two new private bank offices in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we added a new private banking team to cover Southern California. We reached breakeven in August and September and expect to be profitable in Q4 with good momentum entering 2025. Next, our commercial bank continues to demonstrate its capacity to serve private capital well. For the quarter, we were number two in the league tables for sponsor leveraged loan arrangements and we remain number one over the past 12 months. We continue to add quality talent to our coverage and our capital markets teams. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to show nice growth. We had 5% year-on-year growth in households and 7% growth in deposits. We look forward to being a key sponsor of the upcoming New York City Marathon as we continue to raise our brand profile in the market. We've executed well on TOP 9, achieving a Q4 run rate benefit of $135 million and we're finalizing the details of TOP 10, which should have a $100 million plus run rate benefit by end of 2025. Our BSO actions continue to proceed as planned. Non-core reduced by $1 billion in the quarter and we continue to use the liquidity generated to pay down higher cost funding like brokered CDs. We continue to execute actions in commercial to exit lending-only relationships and we're focused on our medium-term plan to reduce CRE exposure. With respect to our balance sheet, our CET1 ratio is at 10.6%. Adjusting for AOCI puts us at 9.2%. We repurchased $325 million in stock during the quarter. Our spot LDR was 80.8%, and our Federal Home Loan Bank advances remained low at well under $1 billion. We are not seeing much loan demand, but we remain hopeful this should start to pick up in coming quarters. Our P&L was impacted by the drag from forward starting swaps, which commenced in July as well as some fees that pushed out to Q4. Nonetheless, we did a good job managing expenses and credit is performing broadly as expected. Our Q4 guide shows a nice rebound in both NII and fees, leading to positive operating leverage in the quarter. We expect credit to remain broadly stable and we will continue to repurchase shares. For the full year, we will hit most of our beginning of year guide with the exception of balance sheet volume impacting NII and a modestly higher ACL build. We continue to have strong confidence in our medium-term outlook and we've added to the materials in the appendix to show more detail on our NIM progression. Lots of uncertainty in the environment remains, but we feel good about our capacity to manage through that and continue to execute on our broad strategy. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you've come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A. Just on the color on that let me just jump in here, John. But we have the private bank continuing to generate very attractive deposits and they've been growing well over $1 billion in $1.5 billion range the last two quarters. So that will be positively benefiting that mix. And then typically, seasonally, in the fourth quarter, we'll see an uptick in both commercial and consumer in terms of demand deposits. So we're counting on that as part of the equation. Yes, the one other thing is to the fourth quarter lift and then would add to that target as well. And then on volume, too, I think we anticipated a little more loan growth that, I'd say, we had nice loan growth in the private bank, but not maybe quite as much as we thought. I think that's really just timing. And as rates come down that will continue to pick up similarly on commercial bank. We thought we'd see a little faster rebound in line utilization, particularly on the sponsor side. We're starting to see that. So again, I think that's kind of on the come and should -- that's why we have an outlook in the guide that fourth quarter, we should start to see slight growth in our spot loans, even comprehending the non-core rundown. The best thing about the NIM reflation is that there's no real cost of goods sold in terms of the impact on expenses. So that pretty much drops straight through. I think there's clearly going to be continued growth in fees led by capital markets, some of the things we're doing in the payments business, some of the exciting developments in our wealth business but those usually come with payouts and investments on the expense side. But nonetheless, I think the operating leverage should be quite positive when we look out over that 25 to 27 period. Brendan, maybe you could add couple comments. Yes. Good point. Yes. Let me start, and then I'm going to pass it to Don and Brendan to talk about their segments and their outlooks. But we're not calling for any heroics here in fourth quarter. So I think the guide is pretty much derisked from meeting significant step up in loan growth. But it is, I think worth noting that we're starting to see things build a bit. We said our biggest quarterly increase in the private bank and the pipeline is looking pretty good. So I think that will continue. And I think there, as rates come down, folks are willing to transact and borrow. I think it's a similar thing in the commercial bank, where there's lots of interest in private equity kind of starting to realize some exits and put some money to work -- that's -- so we see it by the amount of conversations that we're privy to with clients, but it's starting to build. But really, the dam has not broken yet. And so, I think we'll see that trend continue to flex up. But let me start first with Don and then maybe, Brendan, you could pick up a second. Brendan? Yes. Maybe I'll start, and then we'll pass it around whoever wants to jump in, feel free. But yes, I'd say the big issue that's well known that we've been managing through is the general office portfolio. And that one is going to -- it's a multi-quarter workout that has commenced in '23, it's with us all through '24. It will be with us for a good chunk of 25%. And we think we've got our arms fully around that. We've got very heavy reserves there. We've got our best people working with borrowers to try to come up with mutually satisfactory outcomes. But the timing of when you recognize the charge-offs and when something might go NPA moves around a bit and it's not always in our control. If a borrower decides to put a property up for sale then there are certain actions we have to take in terms of NPA recognition or charge-off recognition. So this quarter, we were on the low end of CRE charge-offs and we had a blip in CRE NPAs. But having said that the problem loan population that we're managing is pretty consistent. And so one of the things we take comfort in is when we look at criticized and classified loans across the board in commercial, they've been pretty stable now for four quarters. So that's the big thing. I'll see, Don, if you want to add any color on the CRE and then Brendan, if anything on the delinquencies. Yes. But there was acceleration in the up cycle towards the later part of the cycle, which I think you mirror that on the downside. And I would also just point to Slide 23 and some of the built-in momentum that we have to raise NIM, so that the need to expend capital to shift the timing on that NIM walk is not something that we need to avail ourselves of. Okay. Great. Well, thanks again, folks for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support in Citizens. Have a good day."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "One other comment I mentioned on the private bank is just remember that the cost base that we're working our way through right now is fixed on the short-term basis with the comp guarantees that we've given to the team. So as the revenue grows, we're kind of earning our way through the comp guarantees. So that's all straight positive operating leverage linked quarter where the revenue is coming without necessarily incremental expenses because we've essentially put that in. And then over time, that will work their way through the guarantee and we get the right scale, they'll grow with further linkage together. But right now, it's just straight revenue growth on top of the fixed expense base. Yes, I'll quickly hit on consumer and then private banking. On the consumer side, I just would remind folks at the pace of rundown on non-core is turning into a net positive. So last year, at this time, we were running off $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a quarter and now we're in the consumer book and now we're in the $800 million to $900 million. So that's -- the linked quarter rundown is slowing a bit and that will continue into the future. And when we look at the growth portfolios, we're seeing decent growth in mortgage and home equity. And as rates pull back a little bit, we expect to see a modest pickup in mortgage originations activity. But as everybody knows, the majority of the country is locked into 3%-ish mortgage rates. And so our HELOC business is incredibly well positioned. We've got a real strength in that business where we're the very top of the league tables and national HELOC originations in the super prime space and you'll continue to see that grow. And I believe that product, it will be a main lever for U.S. consumers as the economy gets more confidence in footing for consumers to borrow against record equity in their homes that's been built up over the last five or six years. So we expect that to continue. The other tailwind -- headwind moving to a tailwind is likely student in a modest way with high rates student loan refinance product has been all that sidelined. And now with the federal government not collecting payments again on that portfolio and rates coming back down, we should see more late 20s, early 30 year olds who have great credit coming back in the money that see value in restructuring their student loan debt. So we're expecting that to modestly pick up, as we get into next year. On the private bank side, it's a little bit of the same story. Rates pulling back should really put more customers an attractive place to use credit. And right now, we're seeing a lot of cash transactions, whether it's on the resi side or business is sitting on the sidelines and we're hearing very strong feedback. But as rates pull back, they'll be more comfortable using credit versus just going cash temporarily on whether it's an investment home or facilitating business growth given that high net worth and ultrahigh net profile of that customer base. So we've got good confidence that the rate dynamic should drive a decent amount of embedded demand. And as everybody knows, we've also went to market very strong on the deposit side. We've been very focused on getting the operations up. There's a progression here on earning the customer's full wallet of do the day-to-day banking really well. Now they'll come from borrowing needs and then we'll build a dislodge well. So there's a natural sort of earned wallet share gain that we anticipate getting as we get into next year on the private banking side that will be supported by the rate environment. Yes. Consumer is broadly normalized and pre-COVID we're between 50 basis points and 55 basis points in net charge-offs. And that's where we are now. And while there's always a little bit of puts and takes. There's nothing that we're observing in the portfolio that's making me lose any sleep. And your question on auto, a couple of comments. One would be -- last quarter was -- on the charge-off side was very low, seasonally impacted, but also we had a very strong recovery month in used value. So this quarter was much more just a reversion to the mean. The other dynamic I would mention in auto, it's tough to read into published delinquency numbers, even though delinquency is relatively in check. But when you're not originating anymore, it takes 12 months to 18 months for a vintage curve to build up to its appropriate steady state and delinquency. So when you shut the pick it off on new originations, it's just a denominator issue that you've got other origination vintages that are normally progressing along their lines to our ultimate expected loss number and you're not getting the denominator benefit of a bunch of new flow coming in that has zero delinquencies. So when you decompose all that there's really nothing that we're worried about whatsoever in the auto portfolio. It's performing exactly as we priced it and exactly as we've expected it to."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\nKristin Silberberg: Thank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun and CFO, John Woods will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking are also here to provide additional colour. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thanks, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced solid results today and we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. Highlights for the quarter include very strong fee performance, good deposit cost management, tight expense control, and credit metrics which were within expectations. Our balance sheet remains robust with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%. Our loan to deposit ratio was 80%. Our ACL ratio was 1.63%. And Federal Home Loan Bank advances are now below $600 million. Of note, we saw our revenues tick up relative to Q1. Our underlying PPNR grew by 2% over Q1. Our underlying net income grew by $13 million or 3%. We repurchased $200 million in shares over the quarter with our sequential EPS up 4%. The combination of our strong capital position, solid returns, and capital freed up from non-core rundown has allowed us the capital flexibility to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Share count is down over 5% versus a year ago. Our fee growth was relatively broad as capital market fees continued their rebound, led by low syndications and bond underwriting. Wealth and card fees, both hit record levels. We also are seeing nice momentum in our well-positioned payments business. Our private bank had a terrific quarter. We reached $4 billion in deposits, up from $2.4 billion in Q1, and tracking well towards our year-end 2025 goal of $11 billion. We brought in two leading private wealth teams in the quarter, one from San Francisco and one from Boston, and we've reached $3.6 billion in assets under management at quarter end with nice momentum. Our commercial bank hired a middle market leader for Florida and for California during the quarter, two increasingly important states for us. Our overall commercial franchise continues to be well positioned in serving the middle market, private capital, and key growth verticals, and we look for our strong performance to continue in the second half. I should pause to give a shout-out to Don McCree for his appointment as Senior Vice Chair in June. Great recognition for his efforts over the years at Citizens. We have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives. TOP 9 is tracking well to targets, and we have commenced work on TOP 10, which will push into new areas like AI. Our BSO work is progressing well. Non-Core ran down $1.1 billion in the quarter. Commercial C&I is refocusing on deep relationships, and we have a medium-term plan to reduce our CRE exposure. Credit metrics are holding up fine outside of General Office. We continue the lengthy workout of General Office, which will take several more quarters before we see improvement. Roughly 70% of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district, where loss given defaults have been about half of CBD properties. The good news is that, we have our arms around the issue and we don't expect to see major surprises. Looking forward, we continue to be upbeat about our prospects. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise, and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year, as well as the medium term. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank, and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, second quarter results were very solid in a number of key areas, starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record results in Wealth and Card. Also, we managed our deposit portfolio quite well, with stable balances and lower interest bearing costs in a competitive environment which positively impacted NII and NIM. Rounding out quarterly results, expenses and credit came in largely as expected. With respect to balance sheet strength, we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of our peer group. And importantly, we are executing well against our various multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank. I'll summarize further highlights of the second quarter financial results, referencing Slides 3 to 6. We generated underlying net income of $408 million for the second quarter, EPS of $0.82, and ROTCE of 11.1%. Maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority, and we ended the second quarter with CET1 at 10.7% or about 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also maintained our strong funding and liquidity profile in the second quarter. Our pro forma LCR is 119%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100%. And our period end LDR improved to 80.4%. On the funding front, we've reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by about $1.5 billion linked quarter to $553 million. We continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful $750 million senior debt issuance during the second quarter, and we added about another $1 billion of auto-backed borrowings. That was our fourth issuance, essentially completing our auto program, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. We also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of new preferred and redeeming $300 million of higher-coupon floating rate preferred on July 8. Credit losses of approximately $180 million were in line with our expectations. The NCO rate rose a little to 52 basis points reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.63% is up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes an 11.1% coverage for General Office, up from 10.6% in the prior quarter. Regarding our strategic initiatives, the private bank is doing very well, having generated $4 billion of deposits and $3.6 billion of AUM through the second quarter. Also, our investments over the years in the private capital and capital market space are playing out nicely, as demonstrated this quarter. Finally, we are excited about our top of house initiatives, including the ongoing benefits from BSO and TOP, as well as growing contributions expected from data and technology-related initiatives, such as generative AI and cloud migration. Next, I'll talk through the second quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances. With respect to NIM, as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide, our margin was down 4 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting a 6 basis point increase in swap expense due to the 60 basis point decline in average receive rate in the quarter. This is partly offset by a net increase in NIM of 2 basis points from all other sources, including higher asset yields, non-core runoff, and good deposit cost performance, with interest bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment with our interest-bearing deposit data at 51%, which was down from 52% in Q1. Moving to Slide 8, our fees were up 7% linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and wealth results. Our capital markets business improved 14% linked quarter with higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees given strong refinancing activity. M&A advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter. However, our deal pipelines remain strong and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of 2024. It's great to see our capital markets business holding the number one middle market sponsor book runner position for the second quarter in a row. This reflects the benefit of the investments we've made in our capabilities since the IPO and demonstrates the diversification of the business. Card fees were a record, primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card platform as well as seasonally higher purchase volume. We delivered record results in Wealth driven by increased sales activity, as well as higher asset management fees given the constructive market environment and contribution from the private bank which will continue to grow given the AUM increase in the second quarter from our wealth team hires. Mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and an improvement in servicing P&L. Production fees were down slightly given a decline in margins. On Slide 9, underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation and we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is progressing well and we continue to expect to deliver a $135 million pre-tax run rate benefit by the end of the year. We have commenced work on our TOP 10 program and will provide more details later this year. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 1% linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and prioritize relationship-based lending. The linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our Non-Core portfolio of $1.1 billion. Core loans were broadly stable with a slight reduction in commercial balances, largely offset by an increase in retail. The decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower return in credit only relationships, lower client loan demand, and corpus continuing to issue in the debt markets. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do an excellent job on deposits in an extremely competitive environment. Period-end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset by strong growth in the private bank. We continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand and lower-cost deposits to higher-cost interest bearing accounts with the Fed holding steady, as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the private bank. As a result, non-interest bearing deposits are stable at about 21% of total deposits. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 69% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits, and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost-effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs were down 3 basis points linked quarter given proactive management of our pricing strategy. Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 52 basis points, up 2 basis points linked quarter reflecting broadly stable charge-offs and lower average loans. The commercial charge-offs in the quarter were largely driven by CRE General Office and the fact that C&I recoveries were higher in 1Q versus 2Q. This increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail, primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and runoff. Non-accrual loans increased 4% linked quarter, driven by increases in CRE General Office and multifamily, which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.63%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the first quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization. Our reserve of $369 million for the $3.3 billion General Office portfolio represents 11.1% coverage, up from 10.6% in the first quarter. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $319 million of cumulative losses in the General Office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding, this represents roughly a 17% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, the General Office portfolio was down roughly $900 million to $3.3 billion at June 30, given paydowns of about $500 million and the charge-offs I just mentioned. The loss experienced so far has been concentrated in the central business district properties with approximately 2 times the loss rate of suburban properties. Suburban exposure is 70% of our total at this point. On the bottom left of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we believe represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.7%, up 10 basis points from 1Q. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers. You can see on Slide 16 where our CET1 stands currently relative to peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased another $200 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $394 million to shareholders in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 17, our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise grounded in primary relationships and high-quality customer growth. Notably, the transformation of our consumer deposit franchise is the chief reason that our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle. We are much more nimble in our deposit raising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools. And where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time, so far this cycle we are better than peer median. We also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building durable relationships with our customers and we are focused on scaling our Wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit shares we build our customer base, particularly in New York Metro. Next, we believe we have built the leading commercial bank amongst the super-regional banks. We are focusing on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high growth sectors of the economy and we have full set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest dealmaking periods in decades. We are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop and our consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have a right to win as activity picks up. Finally, we're building a premier private bank, and that is going very well and gaining momentum. We're growing our client base and now have about $4 billion of attractive deposits, a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter, with roughly 30% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $1.4 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently opened private banking offices in Mill Valley, California and Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Citizens Wealth Management business as the center piece of that effort. We added two exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter, one from San Francisco and the other from Boston, bringing the total private bank AUM to $3.6 billion, well on our way to hit our $10 billion target by the end of 2025. Importantly, our private bank revenue increased 68% to about $30 million in the second quarter, and we are on track to break even on the bottom line later this year. Moving to Slide 18, we provide the guide for the third quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of September and December. We expect NII to be down 1% to 2%, driven by one last step up in swap costs this cycle. Noninterest income should be up slightly, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets, more than offset by a pickup across other categories. We expect non-interest expense to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be down modestly, and the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff. Our CET1 ratio is expected to come in about 10.5% with approximately $250 million to $300 million of share reports currently planned. With respect to the full year 2024 guide we provided in January, we feel good about the overall level of PPNR. Revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes. NII is expected to come in at the upper end of the down 6% to 9% range, reflecting lower loan balances, with NIM trending modestly better. Fee should come in modestly above the range of 6% to 9% originally expected. You should expect us to continue to do well on expenses, which will be broadly in line with the January guide. We expect NII and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter given swap costs that peaked in the third quarter with a return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In addition, net charge-offs are trending in line with our January expectations. We continue to expect to end the year with a target CET1 ratio of approximately 10.5% and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. To wrap up, we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets, record results in wealth and card, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. Our capital levels are strong, near the top of our peer group, and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding. Our unique multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank are progressing well, and our consumer and commercial banking businesses are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term. Given these tailwinds, combined with strong execution and tight expense management, we remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Bruce Van Saun Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Go ahead.\nPeter Winter: Good morning. Can you provide an update on the loan outlook in the second half of the year and maybe just talk about customer sentiment and what it's going to take to kind of move them off the sidelines?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I'll go ahead and jump on that one. So, I mean, I think we're seeing pretty positive signs, for 2H as it relates to loan growth. When we look at the three different businesses that really will drive that, we've got the private bank, which has demonstrated the ability to not only grow deposits and AUM, but the private bank is actually penetrating its customer base and growing loans in the second quarter, and we expect that to actually continue and begin to accelerate into the second half. In the commercial space, customer activities picking up, we do expect to see, particularly in our sort of, you call it, M&A, advisory-related driven finance arena, we're seeing some opportunities in the subscription line space as well as some pick up in fund finance. And then in retail, we've been seeing some opportunities in HELOC and mortgage. So all three legs of our stool, as we call it, are starting to demonstrate the ability to really deliver on that loan growth expectation as you look out into the second half.\nDon McCree: Yes, John, I'll jump in on that. It\u2019s Don. I think one of the interesting things we've seen, and this goes to capital markets also, is a real pick up in new money activity over the last six to eight weeks as the interest rate cycle appears to be abating and the economy seems to be okay. So that's driving growth in subscription lines. That's driving a little bit more bullishness among our core C&I customers and it's certainly driving opportunistic activity among the PE firms. So, I think we'll see some decent growth in the second half of the year. Exact timing, I'm not exactly sure, but we did see at the end of the second quarter the beginnings of some pretty significant draws on our subscription loans.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, and I'll jump in too on the consumer and private banking side. The consumer story is a little complicated given the non-core run down. We're running down $800 million to $1 billion each quarter, but if you put that aside, the fundamentals of our core loan business are actually growing at a reasonable clip, really led by residential lending and a little bit in card. Our HELOC position remains incredibly strong. And with rates being higher than we had expected going into the year and our customers having the most home equity in their personal balance sheet in the history of the United States, our HELOC market position is reaping a lot of benefits for us. So we're seeing very strong HELOC growth despite the mortgage challenges, some modest growth in the mortgage portfolio. And we're starting to see a bit of a tick-up on the card book. And then turning to the private bank, really our offering is much broader than what the team that we hired was used to. So we're starting to see a diversification of that book. Early days it was really led by private equity and venture capital call lines. That's still a strength of the business model. We did see in this last quarter in Q2 a diversification towards consumer. So consumer is now 36% of the loan book versus in the low 20s earlier in the year. So mortgage is starting to pick up, some HELOC lending, and still continued strength in business banking and private equity. We expect that trend to continue.\nPeter Winter: That's a great color. Thank you. And just on a separate question, the stress capital buffer came in higher than I was expecting. I'm sure it's higher than what you were expecting. Are there any plans to kind of reassess any of the businesses to help drive a lower [SCB] (ph)? Bruce, you mentioned some plans over the medium term to reduce the CRE exposure.\nPeter Winter: Yeah, I guess we were a bit disappointed in the SCB result. And I'd say, I think the Fed overall does a pretty good job on credit. They are very conservative, but they have a lot of data to work from. And where we've consistently been frustrated has been on their modeling of PPNR. And so, our own modeling of PPNR is kind of much more robust. I think we do things like we pick up forward to starting swaps. We tailor the situation to the scenario where if rates are much lower, then we're going to see a pickup in mortgage fees and a pickup in capital markets fees, depending on the scenario. But anyway, I'd say the good news is, we have sufficient capital. We run at a conservative level. So having a higher SCB than we think is appropriate isn't really hindering our strategy. And so, I don't think, Peter, that we need to make significant changes to the business model. I think we're on the right track. Having said that, the balance sheet optimization is still places where there's work to do to optimize the risk-adjusted return that we make off the balance sheet and to hopefully improve some of the stress results on the credit side. And so, CRE, we can see, that run down, we popped up after we did the investors acquisition. A lot of that was low risk, multifamily. But certainly, we want to create the capacity to lend in areas that really further deeper relationships and we'll have more C&I kind of fill some of that void as we bring down CRE would probably be the biggest shift that you'd see on the balance sheet over time.\nPeter Winter: Got it. Thanks, Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Next question, Alen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open.\nErika Najarian: Hi, good morning. This question -- this first question is for John. John, I think you were at a conference in June, and you talked about, very positively, about an exit rate for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the net interest margin. I'm wondering if you could readdress that again and maybe put it in context of -- you noted that the swap costs were peaking in the third quarter. If you can give that in context on how you expect asset yields to traject as we think about that September and December rate cut. And obviously the 3 basis point improvement in interest bearing deposit costs are notable. It's often the trajectory from here, whether it's in context of the rate cuts and without.\nJohn Woods: Yes, sure, Erika. I guess what I'll start off with is that, at the beginning of the year, we did indicate that we thought the exit NIM would be in that neighborhood of 2.85% or so. I'd say that as we've gotten into the middle part of the year, we expect that to come in a little better. So I think I did mention that at conference earlier last quarter and I think we can confirm that those trends continue to be looking good that we're going to end up a little better than what we expected. And broadly, what we said at the time was that, we saw loans coming in a little lower and pushed out a little bit more than we had originally expected, but that was getting offset, in part from better net interest margin trends, we were pleased to be able to print a very strong interest-bearing deposit costs number that was down 3 basis points this quarter. I think it's very likely that our interest-bearing deposit costs have peaked in the first quarter, that we had some nice opportunity to kind of price our rollovers of CDs in the second quarter, and that was a tailwind. I think there'll be some variability there, but I think 1Q is probably the peak, and that will provide a nice tailwind as you get into the second half of the year. I mean, broadly, the trends when you get into the fourth quarter are along the following lines. Every quarter, we're generating a couple of basis points of positive benefit from all other sources outside of swaps. And so given the third quarters, the last time that we'll see a step up in swap costs, really that the rest of the bank will be able to drive net interest margin rising off of that NIM trough in 3Q into 4Q. And the big drivers would be, there's a number of them. I mean, we've got non-core, which continues to run off and is providing about 2 basis points a quarter of net interest margin all by itself. You've got asset yields around 5 basis points or so, ex-swaps, given the front book, back book dynamic that we're seeing, which is in that 200 basis point to 300 basis point range from the standpoint of what's happening with securities and loans. And then, you have the initiatives with the private bank, which is accretive across the board, which is contributing. So all of those things I think you'll see contribute. And I'd say that getting that first Fed cut in late September would be also helpful. It's not necessary for us to stay on track for having a really strong rebound in 4Q, but it does help, I'd say, address the higher for longer pressures that -- pricing pressures on deposits that will continue to bump along until that first cut comes out from the Fed. So let me stop there and see if that addresses the number of the points that you made.\nErika Najarian: That does. And as you lay out the past, and you said a third -- from a rising past for the net interest margin from what you mentioned as a 3Q 2024 trough. I'm wondering about the size of the balance sheet. Do you feel like your mix is optimized? In other words, as your investors think about a normalizing NIM and multiply that by your balance sheet, is your balance sheet growth going to be in line with business growth, or will there be moves that you're making in terms of wholesale funding or whatever else that could move balance sheet growth sort of underneath business growth or above business growth?\nJohn Woods: Yes, it's a good question. I'd say, I think there might be two different answers here. One is, in the second half of 2024, we have a -- at the balance sheet date here at June 30, we have a significant amount of excess liquidity. And so, you could see us deploy some of that into lending through the second half. And that's very powerful in terms of the ability to drive net interest margin. And so, we're pleased to be able to do that, given how strong our balance sheet position is at June 30. But I'd say when you zoom out and think about the median term, we without a doubt have opportunity to grow the balance sheet over time in line with business growth adjusted for the balance sheet optimization initiatives that we have in place, but that powerful combination of net interest margin reflating into that, call it, what do we say, 3.25% to 3.40% range plus the opportunity to grow the balance sheet over the medium term is really one of the -- is the primary and majority driver of our ROTCE targets over the medium term. So, I think maybe a little bit of transition in 2H where we'll probably deploy some liquidity, but then growing into 2025 and 2026 and beyond.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add to that, Erika, is I do think we have one thing that's pretty unique to us, which is the launch of the private bank. So, if we just grow at kind of nominal GDP, kind of in the medium term for consumer and commercial, we should grow a little faster, because the private bank is scaling up. And certainly as the customer base grows and we keep adding and investing in the business, we should see additional growth there.\nErika Najarian: Well said, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mr. Nash, if you could please check your mute feature on your phone.\nKristin Silberberg: Alen, maybe we can come back to Ryan. Let's move on to the next question and we'll circle back to Ryan. Operator Yes, one moment please. [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nScott Siefers: Thanks for taking the question. Maybe we could sort of pivot to the fee story for a moment. That's been a pretty solid story this quarter. And John, it sounded like we'll see maybe some seasonal capital markets weakness in the third quarter, but it feels like it's on a good trajectory. So just maybe some thoughts on the overall investment banking pipeline, how it looks, and then just broader thoughts on the main drivers as you see them for the fee-based outlook?\nJohn Woods: I'll start off with the broader picture and maybe let Don tell us a little bit more about the capital markets pipeline outlook. But more broadly, I mean we're really pleased with our performance in the second quarter and printing another number one middle market sponsor position on the table. It's nice to see the second quarter in a row. 3Q is the typical seasonal period where it's a little down for capital markets and we expect that that may play out as it's done in prior years. But I think the floor in that seasonally down period is actually higher this year than it's been in prior years. So that's something to keep in mind, that given all of the investments, we actually sure will be down off a great 2Q, but the floor is probably higher than prior years, number one. Number two, the diversification not only within capital markets but outside of capital markets and all the investments we've been making in wealth. We had those two significant asset management teams that we brought on board plus all of our organic investments inside the private bank and broadly is really driving wealth fees. So here to see wealth fees be a bigger contributor in the third quarter. And just as you see the rate environment moving around, we're seeing opportunities in helping our customer hedge the exposure to rates. And so, we expect to see some benefit there. And just a number of other categories, including service charges and ability for possibly some mortgage banking opportunities, as rates seem to be stabilizing and down. So there's just a number of other categories, given the diversification of the platform, that will allow us to stay on track here as you head into the third quarter.\nBruce Van Saun: And also, just to add to that, we did take some regulatory cleanup items in other incomes, so that was suppressed in the quarter, which should bounce back next quarter. But with that, Don, why don't you give a little more color on kind of\u2026\nDon McCree: Yes, so it's interesting. The characteristics of the market are very favorable right now. There's enormous amounts of liquidity. And that drove really the first half of the year, which was primarily like a refinancing market. So if you look at transactions done in the core capital markets being syndicated lending and bonds, it was about 85% refinancing of existing exposures that were on people's balance sheet and extending maturities and the like. What we didn't see and what we're beginning to see is new money activity led by the private equity team. So as we move into a more favorable interest rate environment, a decent economic environment, we're starting to see the pipelines really grow on the PE side of the business. And frankly, that's where the big underwritings are, and that's where the profitability drives. M&A is hanging in there pretty well. Remember, we are primarily a middle market investment bank, so we do the mid-sized deals, $100 million valuation to $1 billion valuation, $100 million capital raise to $1 billion capital raise. So those have actually been more resilient than the really big ticket M&A deals, which are getting government scrutiny and getting held up in regulatory approval. So those seem to be moving along reasonably well. The place we haven't seen a lot, we've seen actually more than we saw last year, is in the IPO side of the business. There are a lot of IPOs that are kind of prepped and ready, but people aren't pulling the trigger and going to market. And some of that's been the aftermarket performance of the IPOs that have happened so far. But if we can continue to get the broadening of the equity markets and the high rise of the equity markets, you could see some of that begin to come. And then we have a pretty decent pipeline in the convert side and the follow on side. So it's broad-based. It's pretty encouraging. And I think the backdrop is very favorable for a good second half and a great 2025, frankly. And we think we've got all the pieces we need to take advantage of the markets.\nBrendan Coughlin: I'd maybe just very quickly add on the consumer side, our improvement is very durable, sticky fee revenue. So the card changes that both John and Bruce mentioned, we reissued 3.5 million debit cards last quarter in a new contract that just drops directly to the bottom line. It's predictable and will stick around. Service charges has bottomed out. Mortgage we think will be in the zone, it could get a little bit of favorability if rates drop a little bit. And then the wealth AUM growth is sticky, durable, repeatable fee income. So that's what we're calling for, a steady continued upward momentum on consumer without a lot of volatility.\nBruce Van Saun: I'll just add one more thing, as we're beginning to see, it's interesting because the private banking teams never had a capital market business at their prior employer. And so we're starting to see some crossover activity among the private banking clients here coming on board into capital markets. I don't know if that's a second half thing, but I think that's a brand new opportunity from a client base that was never really resident at Citizens before.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. Thank you for that color. And then wanted to ask a little bit about the reserve and specifically the office reserve. I think we're up at 11.1% now, which is, of course, very, very high. I guess I'm curious about the factors, as you might think about them, that would allow you to start sort of absorbing losses with that existing reserve. In other words, what sort of allows that office reserve to start to come down rather than to continue to take off? I think when you talk about the reserve more broadly, you've pointed to non-core runoff as being the thing that might allow the reserve to benefit, but just curious about how office fits in there in particular.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, I would say -- I'll start and let John add color, but I'd say that office, there's still a lot of uncertainty in that space. Just what we're seeing in terms of valuations, cap rates, the path of future interest rates. And so, I think we've played it conservatively with having a big reserve and then just kind of letting the charge-offs run through, while maintaining the reserve. I think you'd have to get to a point where you started to see things solidify a little bit and start to move in the right direction, so to speak. And I don't really see that happening actually for certainly this year. It will happen maybe sometime in next year. So we're kind of prepared for a slog here on office that we've got our arms around the properties. We know what the maturity schedules are. We've got good people working with the borrowers to deliver good outcomes. I don't expect we'll see any big surprises, but we'll continue to, I think, just work our way through it. At the point where we hit a kind of feel better moment when things start to look like they're moving in the right direction, that's when we'll be able to start to draw down on the reserve and we'll reap a nice benefit when that happens. John?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I would just echo that point. I mean just having some growing confidence in valuations and seeing maybe transactions occur could be a likelihood of 2025 outcome. And so this is a multi-quarter probably multiyear journey that we're on. But given all the balance sheet strength, that we have with our capital position, we feel really confident that any uncertainties are expressed in the reserves and any other -- anything else would be supported by the capital. I would also mention that we're working the book down. I mean we started out at $4.2 billion, we\u2019re down to $3.3 billion. So we're lowering the exposure every quarter we're working...\nBruce Van Saun: That's a good way through repayments and some of it is through [indiscernible] Nonetheless, it is coming down.\nJohn Woods: Exactly. And we're getting some kind of payoffs and paydowns. We're getting -- we're working through the riskier credits and we're having conversations that have been accelerated given our maturity profile that we've had the opportunity to really lean in with our borrowers and when and if we've come to sort of extensions, we've been able to extract, in many cases, better positioning and collateral. So this is, as I said, a multi-quarter journey, and we're feeling good about our [indiscernible].\nBruce Van Saun: I\u2019ll just elevate too, to the second part of your question is that, away from that, away from the General Office, we're still feeling good about what we're seeing in the consumer metrics, in commercial C&I and we run our reserve calculations based on scenarios. And clearly, the risk of recession seems to be less than it was a couple of quarters ago. And so, our need to keep adding to reserves for rest of the book would seem to be abating somewhat. So that's why when we say we'll continue to see -- we're calling out a slightly lower charge-off number in Q3, and then we have the trend of being able to draw down on those reserves, which I think will accelerate in coming quarters.\nScott Siefers: Perfect. All right. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. One moment please while we open your line Mr. Usdin. Your line is open, go ahead.\nKen Usdin: Okay, great. Good morning. Hey, John and Bruce, on the cost side, so you guys are doing early job keeping costs flat. You mentioned earlier, you're hiring some bankers. You obviously have the wealth management people. And I'm just wondering if you can help us understand like the growth that you have there and like where the top and extra cost program are in terms of the offsets to be able to kind of still hold the line? I know that it's kind of in line with your full year guidance, but just the puts and takes of kind of where we are at this point of the year in terms of -- is there just more to come on top to offset those hires and the growth and the strong investment banking results, et cetera? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. Just talking about TOP, it's been emblematic of who we are, as you know, for a number of years. The top line program is going to generate, call it, $135 million or so of run rate benefits when you get to the end of this year in 2024, the underpinnings of that program, we often have vendor contributions. That's a big driver. We launched the data and analytics contribution this year, which will continue into future years. We've had a really interesting ability to invest in our [fraud] (ph) program and a number of other opportunities, including branch rationalization that have underpinned a really strong TOP program this year. And that, of course, is the way over time, we have been able to invest in entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives, while not needing to cover that and to sell fund, those kinds of things. The TOP 10 program we're working on. And we're feeling good about the early opportunities. I think we have launched some analysis in the generative AI space, and we're live on a couple of use cases. And I think we're going to see an ability to broaden out there pretty nicely in terms of underpinning the next TOP program. There's a half a dozen of other areas, expanding data and analytics. What we're doing in our technology space, which converging our platforms with our ability to converge our mainframes and so I do think that we feel very good about the ongoing ability to make investments and self-fund those investments to the TOP program in -- as you get into the end of 2024 and into 2025 and maybe I'll just stop there and see if there's anything else I would like to add.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. All right. Second question, I know that you issued 400 preferreds and redeemed 300 at the -- in early July. And I think with that, you're still kind of in the 1.2%, 1.3% zone, maybe 1.3%, preferred to RWAs as you contemplate the buyback as you think about the SEB and all of that, like how do you just think about the overall capital stack in terms of like what your ultimate goals are for optimization of your capital position? Thanks.\nJohn Woods: We're feeling pretty good about where we stand in the capital space. I mean, I think we basically think that around 1.25% is fine. We end up with -- we probably have more CET1, so when you look at the overall Tier 1 stack, we've got higher quality capital given the fact that we have more CET1 driving our overall Tier 1. 1.25% is fine, it\u2019s probably -- we probably won't go much below that and a range of 1.25% to 1.50% of RWAs is probably where we'll operate. We have a number of issues out there that are coming into the ability to -- into call periods and into 2025. And so there could be some opportunities to refinance, just like we did this year, there are some very interesting refinance opportunities to lower our preferred coupon that we're paying on the preferred capital. So that's something we'll keep an eye on as we go forward into 2025.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. And sorry, just one to follow up on that last one. Just the -- so the RWAs have been coming down and your average earning assets have been kind of flat. And I know you talked a little bit about this earlier. But is kind of flattish on total balance sheet size, average earning assets. Is that the right way to think about things going forward given all the moving parts on both sides of the balance sheet?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, for 2024, I think the answer to that is yes, with growing RWAs. As I mentioned, we have excess liquidity at June 30 and you could see the overall balance sheet being basically in the same zone as where we are today, but the ability to basically deploy some excess liquidity into lending in the second half is really the plan. So we would see RWAs and loans growing from June 30 to the end of the year.\nBruce Van Saun: We can see some growth, though, in I'd say, spot deposits and spot loans in Q4 above that, about just deploying the liquidity. So just to be clear.\nJohn Woods: Yes, agreed. We're going to see deposit growth and loan growth. It's just that given the excess securities that we have on balance sheet overall interest-earning assets are about where they will be maybe just a little bit higher.\nKen Usdin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nManan Gosalia: Hey, good morning. If I try to back into the 4Q NII number using your full year guide and the 3Q guide, it implies 3% to 4% quarter-on-quarter increase in NII in 4Q. My question there is, what do you need to see that uptick in NII? I know there's some benefit from the -- on the swaps front, but do you also need to see loan growth. Do you need to see deposit costs continuing to come down? Do you need any help from rates? Can you help us frame that?\nJohn Woods: Sure. Yes. And I'd say broadly that the majority of the increase in 4Q is really coming from net interest margin rebounding. So just allowing all of those positive tailwinds from net interest margin across the whole platform from noncore, the front book, back book dynamics and all of those drivers is the majority of the increase in NII for 4Q. However, there is a meaningful contribution expected from loan growth as well, and we talked about loan growth earlier in the call and how all three businesses, Private Bank, consumer and commercial are all expected to contribute to that in terms of how that plays out for the second half. When it comes to just that net interest margin number, as I mentioned, noncore front book, back book -- you also have increase in deposits that you just heard Bruce talk about that increase -- that's a better funding mix where we'll have more deposits and less wholesale funding as you get into the second half. Your other question about that deposit pricing and the rate cut. I think we're somewhat well balanced around whether the Fed cuts or not. We tend to have some offsetting forces there where we have some asset sensitivity and a net floating position that benefits with rates being a little higher, but then that often the higher for longer impact on deposit migration tends to keep us close to neutral. And so, whether we get a cut or not, I think we're feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter NII being a nice rebound and a meaningful increase versus 3Q. And then the last part I'll throw out there is, again, all the initiatives and how -- for example, balance sheet optimization and Private Bank are all accretive to net interest margin on a quarterly basis.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would just add to that as well that we also think that reminder that the Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for fees. So I think there could be that rebound in NII kicking in Q4, strong feed quarter, continued discipline on expenses, credit seemingly moving in the right direction. So -- and then continued share repurchase. So you put that all together, you could have kind of a nice uptick in the Q4 results.\nManan Gosalia: That's really helpful. And then as a follow-up on the commercial middle market side, you outlined several positive drivers for lines picking up in the back half. Does that come with higher utilization? Or do you need to see lower rates for utilization to pick up? And maybe how does the uncertainty around the election? How is that factoring into your conversations with clients?\nDon McCree: Yes, what we're assuming in our utilization growth as it's largely in the capital call and subscription lines. So we're seeing a little bit in the middle market. So I think the middle market trend will be a little bit longer. What we've seen our middle market companies do is kind of take their leverage levels down with economic uncertainty. So as the economy begins to show signs of stabilization, more certainty stabilization, maybe they get a little more aggressive investing in their businesses. And I was with a whole bunch of middle-market CEOs last week and every single one of them said they have were new investment plans over the next 18 months. So that will take a little bit longer. And I don't really see massive impact of -- from the election. I think you may get some market volatility based on what someone says day in, day out. But I think the medium-term trend is intact. And we are seeing -- I mean, the playbook we're going to run in California and Florida, which Bruce mentioned, is going to mirror the playbook we ran in New York, where we're having just extremely strong client acquisition as we bring experienced market bankers onto the platform, and they their clients with them. So very early days, but those pipelines are building kind of literally within two months of hiring the new bankers. So there won't be huge numbers of the asset, but that will be another tailwind for us, I think.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nJohn Pancari: Bruce, I think you talked about the expectation, the medium-term plan to shrink the CRE exposure incrementally from here. Just wanted to get an idea of where you think that could settle out? I mean, right now, your commercial real estate loans are about 130% of your risk-based capital plus reserves, where do you think it goes from that perspective post this expected runoff.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I'd say over the medium term, we'd probably take the pure commercial book down at least 25%. And that will come across the asset classes, obviously, want to be smaller in office, multifamily, we can lead that down a bit since we took a big upsurge with the investors deal. We will make room for some CRE opportunities with the private bankers since it's important part of their customer base. And so, there'll be a little bit of offset to that. But that kind of directionally gives you a sense as to kind of what the plans are. And as I said earlier in the call, I think we're making room for more C&I growth that we'd like to kind of flex and have a bigger loan capital allocation to C&I and a smaller to CRE over time.\nJohn Pancari: Right. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And related to that, my second one is on the private banking side. First, on the deposit side, the $4 billion in deposits, I know 81% of that is commercial, 36% of that is DDA. How much of those deposits are deposits with venture capital and private equity firms are related to that industry.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Of the commercial and business banking oriented deposits, the majority are from private equity and venture firms. But I would note that it's heavily led by operating deposits. And so the way that the relationship actually works is starting as their cash management operating bank, which is why the DDA and [indiscernible] percentages is so high in the business. So they're stable, predictable and generally lendable deposits. So we're pleased with the profile. If you think of the loans that have come in, obviously, the LDR of the private bank is quite low, and we've got a good amount of liquidity padding when you look at the lendability of the deposit base to continue to drive loan growth even within the profile of just the private bank. So we're pleased with the quality that you're seeing the loan book diversify to consumers. The deposit book has still remained in that sort of 80-20 split. But given the pace of growth, that obviously suggests that the consumer business is also growing at a pretty healthy clip. That just takes some time, and we do expect that to catch up. And it will diversify over time to more of a 60-40, maybe over the longer-term horizon 50-50. But\u2026\nBruce Van Saun: With both deposits and loans...\nBrendan Coughlin: Both deposits and loans, I mean the higher rates have held back on mortgage, obviously, and then the business banking and commercial deposit growth is quicker and lumpier, but we do expect that to continue to change over time, and we're pleased with the strength of the consumer opening these private banking offices, which should attract more of a high net worth individual as well.\nJohn Pancari: Okay. Thank you. Then one last one. If you could just maybe update us on the likelihood of additional team hires on the private banking side. And then the Wealth AUM going up to about $3.6 billion there. I know you acknowledged that might be a tougher slog and -- but it looks like towards the end of the quarter that you had that big jump in AUM. Just curious if you could give a little bit of color around what's driving that recent upturn.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, I'll start and pass it to Brendan. But I just want to make an overriding point is that, we want to demonstrate that we can run this as a profitable business. And so, when we initiated the launch of the private bank, we put some markers out there as to where -- what we were going to do this year, hitting breakeven in the fourth quarter. And then next year getting to numbers that had $9 billion of loans, $10 billion of AUM, $11 billion of deposits. That translates to 5% accretion to our bottom line. And so, we're still building the business. We're building the service levels. We're making investments in more support people, and we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We want to get that right, we want to get that flywheel running and hit those numbers before we start going crazy making investments in other regions and other opportunities. Having said that, if there are particularly unique situations that we can kind of fit in and execute over the next 18 months that are important locations, and they don't affect our ability to hit the numbers, we'll be open to that. And then the other thing is on the Wealth management side, we had a strong base with Card sell. We knew ultimately that we were going to have to expand the capabilities that we had by bringing in more teams. And the focus has been on a geographically situated teams that can be contiguous with the private banking teams that we've set up in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Florida. And so, so far, we've been able to bring two great teams like quality, everything, one in San Francisco, one in Boston. That's accounting for a big chunk of that rise in AUM with more to transfer in from their customer base. So we have momentum there. We also have a ton of folks interested in joining our platform. So we can have those conversations and keep bringing those wealth teams in because they don't really impact the near-term financials negatively that usually come in around breakeven with an opportunity to quickly turn into profitability. So Brendan, you can add to that.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes, you nailed [indiscernible] what you said. I would just say on the wealth side, we'll be very selective on the banking expansion until not only we make have confidence in hitting the financials, but also it's still built, and we're very pleased with how the build is going and we're attracting clients. The market is still quite disrupted both on the client side as well as the talent side. We're going to be very thoughtful and make sure that we're only attracting the highest of quality teams. We're being very selective on that. On the Wealth side, I would just say, look, for really the first time in our history, I think our right to win in private Wealth is at an all-time high. And there's a lot of inbounds we're getting from some of the highest quality advisers in the market. We're also being very selective there. I'd remind you all that we have long been on hunt for scale here, and we've looked at a lot of acquisitions. We've obviously done one or two over the years, but the economics have been a little out of reach with 10 plus your paybacks on tangible book value when you're buying RIAs, given the multiples that some of the private equity firms are paying. So the economics of the talent acquisition are significantly more attractive to us. Obviously, with de minimis tangible book value hit. And to Bruce's point, there's not really a large J-curve in the short term. So we're very pleased with the inbounds and talent that we're getting. We expect to continue to selectively add top end market, wealth talent to really round out the bankers that we hired. So we're looking forward to a strong second half of the year there.\nJohn Pancari: Great. Thanks, Brendan.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you. Good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John. John, you talked and gave us good detail about the office portfolio of commercial real estate. And I think you said that some of your assumptions in the bottom left-hand corner of Slide 14 show that this downturn is far worse than historical downturns. Can you share with us two ideas or two answers. First is, when you look back, I think you guys have been aggressively attacking this portfolio for just over a year now. When you look back at those early workouts in the second quarter of 2023, how are the assumptions that you're using then compared to today? And then second, and I'm with Bruce that maybe this office problem doesn't resolve itself until sometime next year. What are you seeing incrementally in terms of valuations or losses? Is it still deteriorating in office? Or has it just stabilized and we just got to work through these portfolios?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I'll go ahead and start off, Gerard. I mean, I think that earlier -- what's evolved over the last year or so has been our outlook with respect to valuations and NOI and what the rent rollovers would actually entail and at what speed we would see deterioration. So of course, our reserve levels are higher now than they were a year ago. Every quarter, we endeavor to put a ring fence around our exposures and give it our best attempt at forecasting what we think the evolution will be in valuations and NOI. I'd say that this quarter, we've done that again. And we feel like we've leaned in with this 11.1%, which really -- when you look at the property valuations steep to trough, that 72% has grown over the last year. And those have been the main drivers for why after charging off, we still end up with this reserve of 11.1%. But I'd say that there's still a lot of uncertainty left, but I think the variability, we're hopeful that the variability in this will start to decline as we continue to work through our maturities and have conversations with our borrowers and extract additional collateral and work through paydowns where we can -- this will be a multi-quarter event and it will take into 2025 [indiscernible]\nBruce Van Saun: I would just add that I do think the Fed starting to move rates lower will certainly be help here. So part of the reason the losses ended up higher than what potentially we thought back in early 2023 because those cap rates going up at inflation that was impacting NOI and things like that. And so, I think we've seen inflation now leveling off. And if the Fed starts to move rates down, that could also start to move things in the other direction. It's too early to call a victory here, but there are some positive signs. And I think lease up rates generally are actually holding or potentially getting a little better as return to office picks up. But again, that's not that significant in the big scheme of things.\nGerard Cassidy: Can we -- is it fair to say that the second derivative of the rate of deterioration that you guys are seeing, is it slowing in the office or\u2026\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Yes. Definitely.\nGerard Cassidy: Okay. It\u2019s yes. Okay, good. Thank you. Okay, and then as a follow-up, you guys talked a lot about private equity in your Slide 17, you show some great numbers. Obviously, number one in the sponsor business and your capital markets business is benefiting from that. So the question I have is, and it's not on the capital call or subscription lines, but it seems over the years for banks to win in this capital markets business with sponsors, you have to use your balance sheet to win this business. You've got to lend money to the sponsors. So can you share with us your exposure to, I guess, one of the line items and one of the regulatory reports is non-depository financial lenders that you lending to them. Can you share with us your exposure there? How you manage that risk? Because it seems like banking initial has been derisked, but maybe it's in the private credit side and the indirect exposure for the industry could come through that channel. Can you give us some color there, Bruce, or Don?\nDon McCree: Yes. Hi, Gerard, why don't I take that? It's Don. So we bank the private capital sector in several different ways. We obviously have capital call and subscription lines, which are based on LPs, we have financing lines to some of the private credit organizations, which are kind of structured as almost like asset-backed lending, where we have diversified pools of loans underneath it, we have advance rates and the like. So it's actually relatively safe, almost investment-grade like lending, even if those complexes begin to take some losses on their underwriting portfolios. So we like those two businesses a lot. We're probably not going to grow them too much more across the entirety of the company because it is a large concentration already. But when you look at those non-bank financial numbers that includes insurance companies. There's a whole bunch of other exposures in there also. And then, of course, we land the riskiest stuff we do is to the underlying leverage buyouts and our strategy there forever has been very large holds. It's an underwrite to distribute business. The average outstanding is like $12 million on a given deal. So very diversified across a large group of leveraged credit. The book is actually shrinking, given the lack of market activity over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So we feel like we're very well diversified and I've been doing this business, as you know, for a very long time and where you get really hurt is when you have big concentrations in leveraged loans and we see that with some of our competition, but we're not going to go there just because that's the way you run those businesses. So those are the really big pops.\nGerard Cassidy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Georgia Bank. One moment while we open your line Mr. O\u2019Connor. Your line is now open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Thank you. Good morning. Can you guys talk about how you think deposits will reprice down. I guess, the first kind of, call it, two or three Fed cuts versus and more sustained reduction?\nJohn Woods: Yes, sure. I'll take that. I mean I think what we're likely to see under the first couple of cuts we're modeling out approximately 20% to 30% down betas in those first couple of cuts. The way the forwards have it playing out overall. The longer those cuts are in place, the more there's the opportunity to see rollovers of CDs, et cetera, and to lean in and price down. So the fact that we have, I think the forwards get down to around 4% by the end of 2025 and may start to get into the 3.50% range in terms of our outlook when you get out into 2026 and beyond. Through that full tightening cycle, we think that the full round trip could be -- could approach -- the down beta is good approach where up betas were. Our up beta is around 51%. I think the down beta could get up to that level over the full cycle, but it will be $20 million to $30 million for the first couple.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then thoughts on does deposit growth pick up a bit for, I guess, the industry and you've got some specific initiatives, obviously, but do you see some pickup in kind of broader deposit trends as well with some Fed cuts?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, I think broadly, we believe we're going to have deposit growth in the second half contributing from all three of our businesses. So 2Q is a seasonally down quarter. We saw that, and we're expecting that plus all of our initiatives that we have in place are going to contribute to deposit growth in the second half. We've got that one cut in September, and our outlook that will be helpful. I don't think that it's absolutely necessary to have that cut in order to continue to have deposit growth. But certainly, it would be helpful to get that deposit growth to stop kind of the migration aspects and the mix shifts that the industry has been seeing. And then as you broaden that out, when we have overall deposit growth and average deposits are higher, that will be consistent with a very positive funding mix because wholesale funding can be lower in terms of funding the balance sheet, and that's a tailwind for NII and NIM into the second half as well.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I would just add some color there, the uptick in private bank deposits in the quarter was $1.6 billion. And so you can see that we've really got a cadence and a rhythm in terms of kind of growing the book there and the private bank and bringing in the customer base. So we would expect to have again, something that most other banks don't have to drive deposit growth and having that unique business opportunity. And then there's generally some seasonality that's favorable in the consumer business and the commercial business. So I think the outlook for deposit growth in the second half is pretty solid.\nBrendan Coughlin: The one point I would add on the consumer side is that, we a number of years in a row where we've outperformed on a relative basis on DDA low-cost deposits and with benchmarking that we see so far this year, we believe we're number one in the peer set and consumer for relative DDA performance, and we see that continuing. So we think the trends have stabilized up so much of our deposit strategy is grounded in the health of our DDA base and we expect whatever the market throws us that we'll continue to outperform peers and doing that for a long time now. And certainly, this year has been a real strength.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. I think that's it for the queue. Thank you, everybody, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce. And good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, second quarter results were very solid in a number of key areas, starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record results in Wealth and Card. Also, we managed our deposit portfolio quite well, with stable balances and lower interest bearing costs in a competitive environment which positively impacted NII and NIM. Rounding out quarterly results, expenses and credit came in largely as expected. With respect to balance sheet strength, we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of our peer group. And importantly, we are executing well against our various multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank. I'll summarize further highlights of the second quarter financial results, referencing Slides 3 to 6. We generated underlying net income of $408 million for the second quarter, EPS of $0.82, and ROTCE of 11.1%. Maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority, and we ended the second quarter with CET1 at 10.7% or about 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also maintained our strong funding and liquidity profile in the second quarter. Our pro forma LCR is 119%, which is well in excess of the large bank Category 1 requirement of 100%. And our period end LDR improved to 80.4%. On the funding front, we've reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by about $1.5 billion linked quarter to $553 million. We continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful $750 million senior debt issuance during the second quarter, and we added about another $1 billion of auto-backed borrowings. That was our fourth issuance, essentially completing our auto program, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. We also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of new preferred and redeeming $300 million of higher-coupon floating rate preferred on July 8. Credit losses of approximately $180 million were in line with our expectations. The NCO rate rose a little to 52 basis points reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.63% is up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes an 11.1% coverage for General Office, up from 10.6% in the prior quarter. Regarding our strategic initiatives, the private bank is doing very well, having generated $4 billion of deposits and $3.6 billion of AUM through the second quarter. Also, our investments over the years in the private capital and capital market space are playing out nicely, as demonstrated this quarter. Finally, we are excited about our top of house initiatives, including the ongoing benefits from BSO and TOP, as well as growing contributions expected from data and technology-related initiatives, such as generative AI and cloud migration. Next, I'll talk through the second quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances. With respect to NIM, as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide, our margin was down 4 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting a 6 basis point increase in swap expense due to the 60 basis point decline in average receive rate in the quarter. This is partly offset by a net increase in NIM of 2 basis points from all other sources, including higher asset yields, non-core runoff, and good deposit cost performance, with interest bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment with our interest-bearing deposit data at 51%, which was down from 52% in Q1. Moving to Slide 8, our fees were up 7% linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and wealth results. Our capital markets business improved 14% linked quarter with higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees given strong refinancing activity. M&A advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter. However, our deal pipelines remain strong and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of 2024. It's great to see our capital markets business holding the number one middle market sponsor book runner position for the second quarter in a row. This reflects the benefit of the investments we've made in our capabilities since the IPO and demonstrates the diversification of the business. Card fees were a record, primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card platform as well as seasonally higher purchase volume. We delivered record results in Wealth driven by increased sales activity, as well as higher asset management fees given the constructive market environment and contribution from the private bank which will continue to grow given the AUM increase in the second quarter from our wealth team hires. Mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and an improvement in servicing P&L. Production fees were down slightly given a decline in margins. On Slide 9, underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation and we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is progressing well and we continue to expect to deliver a $135 million pre-tax run rate benefit by the end of the year. We have commenced work on our TOP 10 program and will provide more details later this year. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 1% linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and prioritize relationship-based lending. The linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our Non-Core portfolio of $1.1 billion. Core loans were broadly stable with a slight reduction in commercial balances, largely offset by an increase in retail. The decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower return in credit only relationships, lower client loan demand, and corpus continuing to issue in the debt markets. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do an excellent job on deposits in an extremely competitive environment. Period-end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset by strong growth in the private bank. We continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand and lower-cost deposits to higher-cost interest bearing accounts with the Fed holding steady, as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the private bank. As a result, non-interest bearing deposits are stable at about 21% of total deposits. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 69% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits, and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost-effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs were down 3 basis points linked quarter given proactive management of our pricing strategy. Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 52 basis points, up 2 basis points linked quarter reflecting broadly stable charge-offs and lower average loans. The commercial charge-offs in the quarter were largely driven by CRE General Office and the fact that C&I recoveries were higher in 1Q versus 2Q. This increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail, primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and runoff. Non-accrual loans increased 4% linked quarter, driven by increases in CRE General Office and multifamily, which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.63%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the first quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization. Our reserve of $369 million for the $3.3 billion General Office portfolio represents 11.1% coverage, up from 10.6% in the first quarter. Additionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $319 million of cumulative losses in the General Office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding, this represents roughly a 17% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past six quarters, the General Office portfolio was down roughly $900 million to $3.3 billion at June 30, given paydowns of about $500 million and the charge-offs I just mentioned. The loss experienced so far has been concentrated in the central business district properties with approximately 2 times the loss rate of suburban properties. Suburban exposure is 70% of our total at this point. On the bottom left of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we believe represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.7%, up 10 basis points from 1Q. And if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers. You can see on Slide 16 where our CET1 stands currently relative to peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased another $200 million in common shares and including dividends, we returned a total of $394 million to shareholders in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 17, our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise grounded in primary relationships and high-quality customer growth. Notably, the transformation of our consumer deposit franchise is the chief reason that our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle. We are much more nimble in our deposit raising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools. And where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time, so far this cycle we are better than peer median. We also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building durable relationships with our customers and we are focused on scaling our Wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit shares we build our customer base, particularly in New York Metro. Next, we believe we have built the leading commercial bank amongst the super-regional banks. We are focusing on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high growth sectors of the economy and we have full set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest dealmaking periods in decades. We are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop and our consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have a right to win as activity picks up. Finally, we're building a premier private bank, and that is going very well and gaining momentum. We're growing our client base and now have about $4 billion of attractive deposits, a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter, with roughly 30% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at $1.4 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently opened private banking offices in Mill Valley, California and Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Citizens Wealth Management business as the center piece of that effort. We added two exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter, one from San Francisco and the other from Boston, bringing the total private bank AUM to $3.6 billion, well on our way to hit our $10 billion target by the end of 2025. Importantly, our private bank revenue increased 68% to about $30 million in the second quarter, and we are on track to break even on the bottom line later this year. Moving to Slide 18, we provide the guide for the third quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of September and December. We expect NII to be down 1% to 2%, driven by one last step up in swap costs this cycle. Noninterest income should be up slightly, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets, more than offset by a pickup across other categories. We expect non-interest expense to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be down modestly, and the ACL should continue to benefit from non-core runoff. Our CET1 ratio is expected to come in about 10.5% with approximately $250 million to $300 million of share reports currently planned. With respect to the full year 2024 guide we provided in January, we feel good about the overall level of PPNR. Revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes. NII is expected to come in at the upper end of the down 6% to 9% range, reflecting lower loan balances, with NIM trending modestly better. Fee should come in modestly above the range of 6% to 9% originally expected. You should expect us to continue to do well on expenses, which will be broadly in line with the January guide. We expect NII and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter given swap costs that peaked in the third quarter with a return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In addition, net charge-offs are trending in line with our January expectations. We continue to expect to end the year with a target CET1 ratio of approximately 10.5% and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. To wrap up, we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets, record results in wealth and card, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. Our capital levels are strong, near the top of our peer group, and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding. Our unique multi-year strategic initiatives, including the buildout of our private bank are progressing well, and our consumer and commercial banking businesses are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term. Given these tailwinds, combined with strong execution and tight expense management, we remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. And with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Bruce Van Saun Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for Q&A. Yes, I'll go ahead and jump on that one. So, I mean, I think we're seeing pretty positive signs, for 2H as it relates to loan growth. When we look at the three different businesses that really will drive that, we've got the private bank, which has demonstrated the ability to not only grow deposits and AUM, but the private bank is actually penetrating its customer base and growing loans in the second quarter, and we expect that to actually continue and begin to accelerate into the second half. In the commercial space, customer activities picking up, we do expect to see, particularly in our sort of, you call it, M&A, advisory-related driven finance arena, we're seeing some opportunities in the subscription line space as well as some pick up in fund finance. And then in retail, we've been seeing some opportunities in HELOC and mortgage. So all three legs of our stool, as we call it, are starting to demonstrate the ability to really deliver on that loan growth expectation as you look out into the second half. Yes, sure, Erika. I guess what I'll start off with is that, at the beginning of the year, we did indicate that we thought the exit NIM would be in that neighborhood of 2.85% or so. I'd say that as we've gotten into the middle part of the year, we expect that to come in a little better. So I think I did mention that at conference earlier last quarter and I think we can confirm that those trends continue to be looking good that we're going to end up a little better than what we expected. And broadly, what we said at the time was that, we saw loans coming in a little lower and pushed out a little bit more than we had originally expected, but that was getting offset, in part from better net interest margin trends, we were pleased to be able to print a very strong interest-bearing deposit costs number that was down 3 basis points this quarter. I think it's very likely that our interest-bearing deposit costs have peaked in the first quarter, that we had some nice opportunity to kind of price our rollovers of CDs in the second quarter, and that was a tailwind. I think there'll be some variability there, but I think 1Q is probably the peak, and that will provide a nice tailwind as you get into the second half of the year. I mean, broadly, the trends when you get into the fourth quarter are along the following lines. Every quarter, we're generating a couple of basis points of positive benefit from all other sources outside of swaps. And so given the third quarters, the last time that we'll see a step up in swap costs, really that the rest of the bank will be able to drive net interest margin rising off of that NIM trough in 3Q into 4Q. And the big drivers would be, there's a number of them. I mean, we've got non-core, which continues to run off and is providing about 2 basis points a quarter of net interest margin all by itself. You've got asset yields around 5 basis points or so, ex-swaps, given the front book, back book dynamic that we're seeing, which is in that 200 basis point to 300 basis point range from the standpoint of what's happening with securities and loans. And then, you have the initiatives with the private bank, which is accretive across the board, which is contributing. So all of those things I think you'll see contribute. And I'd say that getting that first Fed cut in late September would be also helpful. It's not necessary for us to stay on track for having a really strong rebound in 4Q, but it does help, I'd say, address the higher for longer pressures that -- pricing pressures on deposits that will continue to bump along until that first cut comes out from the Fed. So let me stop there and see if that addresses the number of the points that you made. Yes, it's a good question. I'd say, I think there might be two different answers here. One is, in the second half of 2024, we have a -- at the balance sheet date here at June 30, we have a significant amount of excess liquidity. And so, you could see us deploy some of that into lending through the second half. And that's very powerful in terms of the ability to drive net interest margin. And so, we're pleased to be able to do that, given how strong our balance sheet position is at June 30. But I'd say when you zoom out and think about the median term, we without a doubt have opportunity to grow the balance sheet over time in line with business growth adjusted for the balance sheet optimization initiatives that we have in place, but that powerful combination of net interest margin reflating into that, call it, what do we say, 3.25% to 3.40% range plus the opportunity to grow the balance sheet over the medium term is really one of the -- is the primary and majority driver of our ROTCE targets over the medium term. So, I think maybe a little bit of transition in 2H where we'll probably deploy some liquidity, but then growing into 2025 and 2026 and beyond. I'll start off with the broader picture and maybe let Don tell us a little bit more about the capital markets pipeline outlook. But more broadly, I mean we're really pleased with our performance in the second quarter and printing another number one middle market sponsor position on the table. It's nice to see the second quarter in a row. 3Q is the typical seasonal period where it's a little down for capital markets and we expect that that may play out as it's done in prior years. But I think the floor in that seasonally down period is actually higher this year than it's been in prior years. So that's something to keep in mind, that given all of the investments, we actually sure will be down off a great 2Q, but the floor is probably higher than prior years, number one. Number two, the diversification not only within capital markets but outside of capital markets and all the investments we've been making in wealth. We had those two significant asset management teams that we brought on board plus all of our organic investments inside the private bank and broadly is really driving wealth fees. So here to see wealth fees be a bigger contributor in the third quarter. And just as you see the rate environment moving around, we're seeing opportunities in helping our customer hedge the exposure to rates. And so, we expect to see some benefit there. And just a number of other categories, including service charges and ability for possibly some mortgage banking opportunities, as rates seem to be stabilizing and down. So there's just a number of other categories, given the diversification of the platform, that will allow us to stay on track here as you head into the third quarter. Yes. I would just echo that point. I mean just having some growing confidence in valuations and seeing maybe transactions occur could be a likelihood of 2025 outcome. And so this is a multi-quarter probably multiyear journey that we're on. But given all the balance sheet strength, that we have with our capital position, we feel really confident that any uncertainties are expressed in the reserves and any other -- anything else would be supported by the capital. I would also mention that we're working the book down. I mean we started out at $4.2 billion, we're down to $3.3 billion. So we're lowering the exposure every quarter we're working... Exactly. And we're getting some kind of payoffs and paydowns. We're getting -- we're working through the riskier credits and we're having conversations that have been accelerated given our maturity profile that we've had the opportunity to really lean in with our borrowers and when and if we've come to sort of extensions, we've been able to extract, in many cases, better positioning and collateral. So this is, as I said, a multi-quarter journey, and we're feeling good about our [indiscernible]. Yes. Thanks, Ken, for the question. Just talking about TOP, it's been emblematic of who we are, as you know, for a number of years. The top line program is going to generate, call it, $135 million or so of run rate benefits when you get to the end of this year in 2024, the underpinnings of that program, we often have vendor contributions. That's a big driver. We launched the data and analytics contribution this year, which will continue into future years. We've had a really interesting ability to invest in our [fraud] (ph) program and a number of other opportunities, including branch rationalization that have underpinned a really strong TOP program this year. And that, of course, is the way over time, we have been able to invest in entrepreneurial and innovative initiatives, while not needing to cover that and to sell fund, those kinds of things. The TOP 10 program we're working on. And we're feeling good about the early opportunities. I think we have launched some analysis in the generative AI space, and we're live on a couple of use cases. And I think we're going to see an ability to broaden out there pretty nicely in terms of underpinning the next TOP program. There's a half a dozen of other areas, expanding data and analytics. What we're doing in our technology space, which converging our platforms with our ability to converge our mainframes and so I do think that we feel very good about the ongoing ability to make investments and self-fund those investments to the TOP program in -- as you get into the end of 2024 and into 2025 and maybe I'll just stop there and see if there's anything else I would like to add. We're feeling pretty good about where we stand in the capital space. I mean, I think we basically think that around 1.25% is fine. We end up with -- we probably have more CET1, so when you look at the overall Tier 1 stack, we've got higher quality capital given the fact that we have more CET1 driving our overall Tier 1. 1.25% is fine, it's probably -- we probably won't go much below that and a range of 1.25% to 1.50% of RWAs is probably where we'll operate. We have a number of issues out there that are coming into the ability to -- into call periods and into 2025. And so there could be some opportunities to refinance, just like we did this year, there are some very interesting refinance opportunities to lower our preferred coupon that we're paying on the preferred capital. So that's something we'll keep an eye on as we go forward into 2025. Yes. I mean, for 2024, I think the answer to that is yes, with growing RWAs. As I mentioned, we have excess liquidity at June 30 and you could see the overall balance sheet being basically in the same zone as where we are today, but the ability to basically deploy some excess liquidity into lending in the second half is really the plan. So we would see RWAs and loans growing from June 30 to the end of the year. Yes, agreed. We're going to see deposit growth and loan growth. It's just that given the excess securities that we have on balance sheet overall interest-earning assets are about where they will be maybe just a little bit higher. Sure. Yes. And I'd say broadly that the majority of the increase in 4Q is really coming from net interest margin rebounding. So just allowing all of those positive tailwinds from net interest margin across the whole platform from noncore, the front book, back book dynamics and all of those drivers is the majority of the increase in NII for 4Q. However, there is a meaningful contribution expected from loan growth as well, and we talked about loan growth earlier in the call and how all three businesses, Private Bank, consumer and commercial are all expected to contribute to that in terms of how that plays out for the second half. When it comes to just that net interest margin number, as I mentioned, noncore front book, back book -- you also have increase in deposits that you just heard Bruce talk about that increase -- that's a better funding mix where we'll have more deposits and less wholesale funding as you get into the second half. Your other question about that deposit pricing and the rate cut. I think we're somewhat well balanced around whether the Fed cuts or not. We tend to have some offsetting forces there where we have some asset sensitivity and a net floating position that benefits with rates being a little higher, but then that often the higher for longer impact on deposit migration tends to keep us close to neutral. And so, whether we get a cut or not, I think we're feeling pretty good about the fourth quarter NII being a nice rebound and a meaningful increase versus 3Q. And then the last part I'll throw out there is, again, all the initiatives and how -- for example, balance sheet optimization and Private Bank are all accretive to net interest margin on a quarterly basis. Yes. I'll go ahead and start off, Gerard. I mean, I think that earlier -- what's evolved over the last year or so has been our outlook with respect to valuations and NOI and what the rent rollovers would actually entail and at what speed we would see deterioration. So of course, our reserve levels are higher now than they were a year ago. Every quarter, we endeavor to put a ring fence around our exposures and give it our best attempt at forecasting what we think the evolution will be in valuations and NOI. I'd say that this quarter, we've done that again. And we feel like we've leaned in with this 11.1%, which really -- when you look at the property valuations steep to trough, that 72% has grown over the last year. And those have been the main drivers for why after charging off, we still end up with this reserve of 11.1%. But I'd say that there's still a lot of uncertainty left, but I think the variability, we're hopeful that the variability in this will start to decline as we continue to work through our maturities and have conversations with our borrowers and extract additional collateral and work through paydowns where we can -- this will be a multi-quarter event and it will take into 2025 [indiscernible] Yes, sure. I'll take that. I mean I think what we're likely to see under the first couple of cuts we're modeling out approximately 20% to 30% down betas in those first couple of cuts. The way the forwards have it playing out overall. The longer those cuts are in place, the more there's the opportunity to see rollovers of CDs, et cetera, and to lean in and price down. So the fact that we have, I think the forwards get down to around 4% by the end of 2025 and may start to get into the 3.50% range in terms of our outlook when you get out into 2026 and beyond. Through that full tightening cycle, we think that the full round trip could be -- could approach -- the down beta is good approach where up betas were. Our up beta is around 51%. I think the down beta could get up to that level over the full cycle, but it will be $20 million to $30 million for the first couple. Yes. I mean, I think broadly, we believe we're going to have deposit growth in the second half contributing from all three of our businesses. So 2Q is a seasonally down quarter. We saw that, and we're expecting that plus all of our initiatives that we have in place are going to contribute to deposit growth in the second half. We've got that one cut in September, and our outlook that will be helpful. I don't think that it's absolutely necessary to have that cut in order to continue to have deposit growth. But certainly, it would be helpful to get that deposit growth to stop kind of the migration aspects and the mix shifts that the industry has been seeing. And then as you broaden that out, when we have overall deposit growth and average deposits are higher, that will be consistent with a very positive funding mix because wholesale funding can be lower in terms of funding the balance sheet, and that's a tailwind for NII and NIM into the second half as well."

            "name": "Don McCree",
            "content": "Yes, John, I'll jump in on that. It's Don. I think one of the interesting things we've seen, and this goes to capital markets also, is a real pick up in new money activity over the last six to eight weeks as the interest rate cycle appears to be abating and the economy seems to be okay. So that's driving growth in subscription lines. That's driving a little bit more bullishness among our core C&I customers and it's certainly driving opportunistic activity among the PE firms. So, I think we'll see some decent growth in the second half of the year. Exact timing, I'm not exactly sure, but we did see at the end of the second quarter the beginnings of some pretty significant draws on our subscription loans. Yes, so it's interesting. The characteristics of the market are very favorable right now. There's enormous amounts of liquidity. And that drove really the first half of the year, which was primarily like a refinancing market. So if you look at transactions done in the core capital markets being syndicated lending and bonds, it was about 85% refinancing of existing exposures that were on people's balance sheet and extending maturities and the like. What we didn't see and what we're beginning to see is new money activity led by the private equity team. So as we move into a more favorable interest rate environment, a decent economic environment, we're starting to see the pipelines really grow on the PE side of the business. And frankly, that's where the big underwritings are, and that's where the profitability drives. M&A is hanging in there pretty well. Remember, we are primarily a middle market investment bank, so we do the mid-sized deals, $100 million valuation to $1 billion valuation, $100 million capital raise to $1 billion capital raise. So those have actually been more resilient than the really big ticket M&A deals, which are getting government scrutiny and getting held up in regulatory approval. So those seem to be moving along reasonably well. The place we haven't seen a lot, we've seen actually more than we saw last year, is in the IPO side of the business. There are a lot of IPOs that are kind of prepped and ready, but people aren't pulling the trigger and going to market. And some of that's been the aftermarket performance of the IPOs that have happened so far. But if we can continue to get the broadening of the equity markets and the high rise of the equity markets, you could see some of that begin to come. And then we have a pretty decent pipeline in the convert side and the follow on side. So it's broad-based. It's pretty encouraging. And I think the backdrop is very favorable for a good second half and a great 2025, frankly. And we think we've got all the pieces we need to take advantage of the markets. Yes, what we're assuming in our utilization growth as it's largely in the capital call and subscription lines. So we're seeing a little bit in the middle market. So I think the middle market trend will be a little bit longer. What we've seen our middle market companies do is kind of take their leverage levels down with economic uncertainty. So as the economy begins to show signs of stabilization, more certainty stabilization, maybe they get a little more aggressive investing in their businesses. And I was with a whole bunch of middle-market CEOs last week and every single one of them said they have were new investment plans over the next 18 months. So that will take a little bit longer. And I don't really see massive impact of -- from the election. I think you may get some market volatility based on what someone says day in, day out. But I think the medium-term trend is intact. And we are seeing -- I mean, the playbook we're going to run in California and Florida, which Bruce mentioned, is going to mirror the playbook we ran in New York, where we're having just extremely strong client acquisition as we bring experienced market bankers onto the platform, and they their clients with them. So very early days, but those pipelines are building kind of literally within two months of hiring the new bankers. So there won't be huge numbers of the asset, but that will be another tailwind for us, I think. Yes. Hi, Gerard, why don't I take that? It's Don. So we bank the private capital sector in several different ways. We obviously have capital call and subscription lines, which are based on LPs, we have financing lines to some of the private credit organizations, which are kind of structured as almost like asset-backed lending, where we have diversified pools of loans underneath it, we have advance rates and the like. So it's actually relatively safe, almost investment-grade like lending, even if those complexes begin to take some losses on their underwriting portfolios. So we like those two businesses a lot. We're probably not going to grow them too much more across the entirety of the company because it is a large concentration already. But when you look at those non-bank financial numbers that includes insurance companies. There's a whole bunch of other exposures in there also. And then, of course, we land the riskiest stuff we do is to the underlying leverage buyouts and our strategy there forever has been very large holds. It's an underwrite to distribute business. The average outstanding is like $12 million on a given deal. So very diversified across a large group of leveraged credit. The book is actually shrinking, given the lack of market activity over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So we feel like we're very well diversified and I've been doing this business, as you know, for a very long time and where you get really hurt is when you have big concentrations in leveraged loans and we see that with some of our competition, but we're not going to go there just because that's the way you run those businesses. So those are the really big pops."

            "name": "Bruce Van Saun",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced solid results today and we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. Highlights for the quarter include very strong fee performance, good deposit cost management, tight expense control, and credit metrics which were within expectations. Our balance sheet remains robust with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%. Our loan to deposit ratio was 80%. Our ACL ratio was 1.63%. And Federal Home Loan Bank advances are now below $600 million. Of note, we saw our revenues tick up relative to Q1. Our underlying PPNR grew by 2% over Q1. Our underlying net income grew by $13 million or 3%. We repurchased $200 million in shares over the quarter with our sequential EPS up 4%. The combination of our strong capital position, solid returns, and capital freed up from non-core rundown has allowed us the capital flexibility to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Share count is down over 5% versus a year ago. Our fee growth was relatively broad as capital market fees continued their rebound, led by low syndications and bond underwriting. Wealth and card fees, both hit record levels. We also are seeing nice momentum in our well-positioned payments business. Our private bank had a terrific quarter. We reached $4 billion in deposits, up from $2.4 billion in Q1, and tracking well towards our year-end 2025 goal of $11 billion. We brought in two leading private wealth teams in the quarter, one from San Francisco and one from Boston, and we've reached $3.6 billion in assets under management at quarter end with nice momentum. Our commercial bank hired a middle market leader for Florida and for California during the quarter, two increasingly important states for us. Our overall commercial franchise continues to be well positioned in serving the middle market, private capital, and key growth verticals, and we look for our strong performance to continue in the second half. I should pause to give a shout-out to Don McCree for his appointment as Senior Vice Chair in June. Great recognition for his efforts over the years at Citizens. We have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives. TOP 9 is tracking well to targets, and we have commenced work on TOP 10, which will push into new areas like AI. Our BSO work is progressing well. Non-Core ran down $1.1 billion in the quarter. Commercial C&I is refocusing on deep relationships, and we have a medium-term plan to reduce our CRE exposure. Credit metrics are holding up fine outside of General Office. We continue the lengthy workout of General Office, which will take several more quarters before we see improvement. Roughly 70% of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district, where loss given defaults have been about half of CBD properties. The good news is that, we have our arms around the issue and we don't expect to see major surprises. Looking forward, we continue to be upbeat about our prospects. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise, and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year, as well as the medium term. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank, and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you come to expect from us. With that, let me turn it over to John. Yes, and I'll jump in too on the consumer and private banking side. The consumer story is a little complicated given the non-core run down. We're running down $800 million to $1 billion each quarter, but if you put that aside, the fundamentals of our core loan business are actually growing at a reasonable clip, really led by residential lending and a little bit in card. Our HELOC position remains incredibly strong. And with rates being higher than we had expected going into the year and our customers having the most home equity in their personal balance sheet in the history of the United States, our HELOC market position is reaping a lot of benefits for us. So we're seeing very strong HELOC growth despite the mortgage challenges, some modest growth in the mortgage portfolio. And we're starting to see a bit of a tick-up on the card book. And then turning to the private bank, really our offering is much broader than what the team that we hired was used to. So we're starting to see a diversification of that book. Early days it was really led by private equity and venture capital call lines. That's still a strength of the business model. We did see in this last quarter in Q2 a diversification towards consumer. So consumer is now 36% of the loan book versus in the low 20s earlier in the year. So mortgage is starting to pick up, some HELOC lending, and still continued strength in business banking and private equity. We expect that trend to continue. Okay. Next question, Alen. I would just add to that, Erika, is I do think we have one thing that's pretty unique to us, which is the launch of the private bank. So, if we just grow at kind of nominal GDP, kind of in the medium term for consumer and commercial, we should grow a little faster, because the private bank is scaling up. And certainly as the customer base grows and we keep adding and investing in the business, we should see additional growth there. And also, just to add to that, we did take some regulatory cleanup items in other incomes, so that was suppressed in the quarter, which should bounce back next quarter. But with that, Don, why don't you give a little more color on kind of... I'll just add one more thing, as we're beginning to see, it's interesting because the private banking teams never had a capital market business at their prior employer. And so we're starting to see some crossover activity among the private banking clients here coming on board into capital markets. I don't know if that's a second half thing, but I think that's a brand new opportunity from a client base that was never really resident at Citizens before. Yes, I would say -- I'll start and let John add color, but I'd say that office, there's still a lot of uncertainty in that space. Just what we're seeing in terms of valuations, cap rates, the path of future interest rates. And so, I think we've played it conservatively with having a big reserve and then just kind of letting the charge-offs run through, while maintaining the reserve. I think you'd have to get to a point where you started to see things solidify a little bit and start to move in the right direction, so to speak. And I don't really see that happening actually for certainly this year. It will happen maybe sometime in next year. So we're kind of prepared for a slog here on office that we've got our arms around the properties. We know what the maturity schedules are. We've got good people working with the borrowers to deliver good outcomes. I don't expect we'll see any big surprises, but we'll continue to, I think, just work our way through it. At the point where we hit a kind of feel better moment when things start to look like they're moving in the right direction, that's when we'll be able to start to draw down on the reserve and we'll reap a nice benefit when that happens. John? That's a good way through repayments and some of it is through [indiscernible] Nonetheless, it is coming down. I'll just elevate too, to the second part of your question is that, away from that, away from the General Office, we're still feeling good about what we're seeing in the consumer metrics, in commercial C&I and we run our reserve calculations based on scenarios. And clearly, the risk of recession seems to be less than it was a couple of quarters ago. And so, our need to keep adding to reserves for rest of the book would seem to be abating somewhat. So that's why when we say we'll continue to see -- we're calling out a slightly lower charge-off number in Q3, and then we have the trend of being able to draw down on those reserves, which I think will accelerate in coming quarters. We can see some growth, though, in I'd say, spot deposits and spot loans in Q4 above that, about just deploying the liquidity. So just to be clear. Yes. And I would just add to that as well that we also think that reminder that the Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for fees. So I think there could be that rebound in NII kicking in Q4, strong feed quarter, continued discipline on expenses, credit seemingly moving in the right direction. So -- and then continued share repurchase. So you put that all together, you could have kind of a nice uptick in the Q4 results. Good morning. Yes. I'd say over the medium term, we'd probably take the pure commercial book down at least 25%. And that will come across the asset classes, obviously, want to be smaller in office, multifamily, we can lead that down a bit since we took a big upsurge with the investors deal. We will make room for some CRE opportunities with the private bankers since it's important part of their customer base. And so, there'll be a little bit of offset to that. But that kind of directionally gives you a sense as to kind of what the plans are. And as I said earlier in the call, I think we're making room for more C&I growth that we'd like to kind of flex and have a bigger loan capital allocation to C&I and a smaller to CRE over time. With both deposits and loans... Yes, I'll start and pass it to Brendan. But I just want to make an overriding point is that, we want to demonstrate that we can run this as a profitable business. And so, when we initiated the launch of the private bank, we put some markers out there as to where -- what we were going to do this year, hitting breakeven in the fourth quarter. And then next year getting to numbers that had $9 billion of loans, $10 billion of AUM, $11 billion of deposits. That translates to 5% accretion to our bottom line. And so, we're still building the business. We're building the service levels. We're making investments in more support people, and we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. We want to get that right, we want to get that flywheel running and hit those numbers before we start going crazy making investments in other regions and other opportunities. Having said that, if there are particularly unique situations that we can kind of fit in and execute over the next 18 months that are important locations, and they don't affect our ability to hit the numbers, we'll be open to that. And then the other thing is on the Wealth management side, we had a strong base with Card sell. We knew ultimately that we were going to have to expand the capabilities that we had by bringing in more teams. And the focus has been on a geographically situated teams that can be contiguous with the private banking teams that we've set up in San Francisco, Boston, New York and Florida. And so, so far, we've been able to bring two great teams like quality, everything, one in San Francisco, one in Boston. That's accounting for a big chunk of that rise in AUM with more to transfer in from their customer base. So we have momentum there. We also have a ton of folks interested in joining our platform. So we can have those conversations and keep bringing those wealth teams in because they don't really impact the near-term financials negatively that usually come in around breakeven with an opportunity to quickly turn into profitability. So Brendan, you can add to that. I would just add that I do think the Fed starting to move rates lower will certainly be help here. So part of the reason the losses ended up higher than what potentially we thought back in early 2023 because those cap rates going up at inflation that was impacting NOI and things like that. And so, I think we've seen inflation now leveling off. And if the Fed starts to move rates down, that could also start to move things in the other direction. It's too early to call a victory here, but there are some positive signs. And I think lease up rates generally are actually holding or potentially getting a little better as return to office picks up. But again, that's not that significant in the big scheme of things. Yes. Yes. Definitely. Yes. I would just add some color there, the uptick in private bank deposits in the quarter was $1.6 billion. And so you can see that we've really got a cadence and a rhythm in terms of kind of growing the book there and the private bank and bringing in the customer base. So we would expect to have again, something that most other banks don't have to drive deposit growth and having that unique business opportunity. And then there's generally some seasonality that's favorable in the consumer business and the commercial business. So I think the outlook for deposit growth in the second half is pretty solid. Okay. I think that's it for the queue. Thank you, everybody, for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "I'd maybe just very quickly add on the consumer side, our improvement is very durable, sticky fee revenue. So the card changes that both John and Bruce mentioned, we reissued 3.5 million debit cards last quarter in a new contract that just drops directly to the bottom line. It's predictable and will stick around. Service charges has bottomed out. Mortgage we think will be in the zone, it could get a little bit of favorability if rates drop a little bit. And then the wealth AUM growth is sticky, durable, repeatable fee income. So that's what we're calling for, a steady continued upward momentum on consumer without a lot of volatility. Yes. Of the commercial and business banking oriented deposits, the majority are from private equity and venture firms. But I would note that it's heavily led by operating deposits. And so the way that the relationship actually works is starting as their cash management operating bank, which is why the DDA and [indiscernible] percentages is so high in the business. So they're stable, predictable and generally lendable deposits. So we're pleased with the profile. If you think of the loans that have come in, obviously, the LDR of the private bank is quite low, and we've got a good amount of liquidity padding when you look at the lendability of the deposit base to continue to drive loan growth even within the profile of just the private bank. So we're pleased with the quality that you're seeing the loan book diversify to consumers. The deposit book has still remained in that sort of 80-20 split. But given the pace of growth, that obviously suggests that the consumer business is also growing at a pretty healthy clip. That just takes some time, and we do expect that to catch up. And it will diversify over time to more of a 60-40, maybe over the longer-term horizon 50-50. But... Both deposits and loans, I mean the higher rates have held back on mortgage, obviously, and then the business banking and commercial deposit growth is quicker and lumpier, but we do expect that to continue to change over time, and we're pleased with the strength of the consumer opening these private banking offices, which should attract more of a high net worth individual as well. Yes, you nailed [indiscernible] what you said. I would just say on the wealth side, we'll be very selective on the banking expansion until not only we make have confidence in hitting the financials, but also it's still built, and we're very pleased with how the build is going and we're attracting clients. The market is still quite disrupted both on the client side as well as the talent side. We're going to be very thoughtful and make sure that we're only attracting the highest of quality teams. We're being very selective on that. On the Wealth side, I would just say, look, for really the first time in our history, I think our right to win in private Wealth is at an all-time high. And there's a lot of inbounds we're getting from some of the highest quality advisers in the market. We're also being very selective there. I'd remind you all that we have long been on hunt for scale here, and we've looked at a lot of acquisitions. We've obviously done one or two over the years, but the economics have been a little out of reach with 10 plus your paybacks on tangible book value when you're buying RIAs, given the multiples that some of the private equity firms are paying. So the economics of the talent acquisition are significantly more attractive to us. Obviously, with de minimis tangible book value hit. And to Bruce's point, there's not really a large J-curve in the short term. So we're very pleased with the inbounds and talent that we're getting. We expect to continue to selectively add top end market, wealth talent to really round out the bankers that we hired. So we're looking forward to a strong second half of the year there. The one point I would add on the consumer side is that, we a number of years in a row where we've outperformed on a relative basis on DDA low-cost deposits and with benchmarking that we see so far this year, we believe we're number one in the peer set and consumer for relative DDA performance, and we see that continuing. So we think the trends have stabilized up so much of our deposit strategy is grounded in the health of our DDA base and we expect whatever the market throws us that we'll continue to outperform peers and doing that for a long time now. And certainly, this year has been a real strength."

We continue to play strong defense through an uncertain environment with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, our LDR at 81%, our allowance for loan loss ratio of 161%, and general office reserves now at 10.6%. On the P&L, we are still seeing a modest decline in NII though our NIM was stable at 2.91%. Fees picked up by 3% sequential quarter, led by capital markets and card and expenses were flat. Our credit trends are in line with expectations. We repurchased $300 million of shares during the quarter as we free up capital from our non-core rundown. Our guide for Q2 and full year remain consistent with our expectations at the outset of the year. Our strategic initiatives are making good progress. The Private Bank is off to a good start, reaching $2.4 billion in deposits at quarter end. We expect momentum to accelerate further over the course of the year. We are also focused on building out private wealth management through further investment in Clarfeld plus several imminent team lift-outs. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to go well with the fastest growth of any of our regions and really strong net promoter scores. Our focus in the commercial bank of serving the middle-market, private capital and key growth verticals has put us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity, which we expect to build further over the course of the year. And our TOP 9 program is being executed well, allowing us to self-fund our growth investments while keeping overall expense growth rate muted. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium term. Over the past decade, we have undertaken a major transformation of Citizens. Our Consumer and Commercial Banking segments are positioned for success, and we are now looking to build the premier bank owned private bank and wealth franchise. Our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital liquidity and funding profile and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. Our expense base has been tightly managed with AI offering the potential for further breakthroughs. Lots accomplished with more to do, clearly, exciting times for Citizens. With that, let me turn it over to John.\nJohn Woods: Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the year is off to a good start. First quarter results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment, which supported an improvement in capital markets, stability in our margin and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels either top of our peer group, excellent liquidity and a healthy credit reserve position. Importantly, this positions us to execute well against our multiyear strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our private bank. Let me start with some highlights of our first quarter financial results, referencing slides 3 to 6 before I discuss the details. We generated underlying net income of $395 million for the first quarter and EPS of $0.79. This includes a negative $0.03 impact from the private bank, which is a significant improvement from the $0.11 impact last quarter as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected breakeven in 2H \u201824. It also improved the impact of the non-core portfolio, which contributed a $0.13 negative impact. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it is steadily running off, creating a tailwind for performance going forward. Our notable items this quarter were $0.14, which primarily consists of an adjustment to the FDIC special assessment and TOP and other efficiency-related expenses. Excluding these notable items, our underlying ROCE for the quarter was 10.6%. Playing through defense remains at the top of our priority list, and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 8.9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also continue to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the first quarter. Our pro forma LCR strengthened to 120%, which is well in excess of the large bank category 1 requirement of 100% and our period-end LDR improved to 81% from 82% in the prior quarter. On the funding front, we reduced our period-end FHLB borrowings by about $1.8 billion linked quarter to a modest $2 billion. We also increased our structural funding base with a very successful $1.25 billion senior issuance and another $1.5 billion auto collateralized issuance during the quarter. And we have another $1 billion of auto backed issuance expected to settle this week. This is our fourth issuance, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. In addition, we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward. Credit trends have been performing in line with our expectations, with NCOs coming in at 50 basis points for the first quarter. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is up 2 basis points from year-end. This includes a 10.6% coverage for general office, up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter. We are well positioned for the medium term with expected tailwinds to NIM that support a range of 3.25% to 3.4%. Regarding strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well. We continue to make inroads in the New York Metro and our latest top program is progressing nicely. In addition, we are poised to benefit from an improving capital markets environment with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions positioning us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up. Next, I\u2019ll talk through the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 3% linked quarter, reflecting a stable margin on a 2% decrease in average interest-earning assets given lower loan balances and day-count. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was flat at 2.91% as the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the impact of swaps. As expected, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta remains in the low 50s at 52%. And although we continue to see deposit migration, the rate of migration is slowing. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally impact the peers. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were up 3% linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good card results. The improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in M&A activity and strong bond underwriting results. Our Capital Markets business consistently holds the top 3 middle market sponsor book renter position and this quarter, we achieved the #1 spot. Our deal pipelines remain strong, and we continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter with strong refinancing activity continuing in the bond market. In card, we had a nice increase, primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit cards to Mastercard. Our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter with lower activity in commodities and FX. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and a modest decline in servicing P&L, partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved while lot volumes were stable. On Slide 9, we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses, which were stable. We will continue to execute on our TOP program, which gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 2% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans, given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand, our highly selective approach to lending in this environment, along with exits of lower returning credit-only relationships. Commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity was limited in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well in deposits. Year-on-year period-end deposits were up $4.2 billion driven by growth in retail and the private bank. Period end deposits were down slightly linked quarter given expected seasonal impacts in commercial largely offset by growth in the private bank and retail branch deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were well controlled, up 6 basis points, which translates to a 52% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 68% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories continue to moderate. And with the contribution of attractive deposits from the private bank, non-interest-bearing deposits are holding steady at about 21% of total deposits. Moving on to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 50 basis points, up 4 basis points linked quarter. This includes increased commercial charge-offs related to pre general office, which were in line with our expectations. In retail, we saw a modest seasonal improvement. Non-accrual loans increased 8% linked quarter driven by general office. The continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail, while other retail categories were stable. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the fourth quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization. The reserve for the $3.4 billion general office portfolio represents 10.6% coverage, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than we\u2019ve seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 8.9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers, and you can see on Slide 16, where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter. Given our strong capital position, we resumed common share repurchases and including dividends, we returned a total of $497 million to shareholders in the first quarter. On the next few pages, I\u2019ll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank. First, on Slide 17, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise, a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationship-based lending and a meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress taking deposit share with retail deposits up 20% year-on-year as we continue building our customer base in New York Metro. Slide 18. Let me update you on our progress in building a premier private bank, taking the opportunity to fill the void left in the wake of the bank failures last year. Our build net is going very well and gaining momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $2.4 billion of attractive deposits with roughly 30% non-interest-bearing. Also, we are now at just over $1 billion of loans and $0.5 billion of investments and continuing to grow. We just opened our newest private banking office in Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Clarfeld Wealth Management business as the centerpiece of that effort. Next, on Slide 19, we have built a formidable full-service commercial bank, which consistently punches above its weight. Our multiyear investments in talent, capabilities and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to provide life cycle services to middle market, mid-corporate and sponsor clients in high-growth sectors of the U.S. economy. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem. As evidenced by our consistent standing at the top of the sponsored lead tables, we are well positioned to take advantage of a more constructive capital markets environment and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions coming through in our results this quarter. Moving to Slide 20, we provide the guidance for the second quarter. We expect NII to decrease about 2%. Non-interest income should be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect non-interest expense to be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs are expected to be about 50 basis points and the ACL should continue to benefit from the non-core runoff. Our CET1 is expected to come in at about 10.5% with approximately $200 million of share repurchases currently planned. We are broadly reaffirming our full year 2024 guide. We expect NII to land within the range of down 6% to 9%, consistent with our January guidance, with margin coming in a little better than expected, offsetting the impact of lower loan demand. The other components of PPNR are also tracking to our January guidance. In addition, NCOs are trending in line with our expectations of approximately 50 basis points for the year. Our target CET1 ratio for 2024 is approximately 10.5%, and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. Given the changing rate outlook, I wanted to update you on how the swaps and our non-core portfolio are expected to impact NII and NIM as we look out further in 2024 and beyond. We\u2019ve included Slide 25 in the appendix, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. By 4Q 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. Looking out further, we expect a significant NII tailwind and NIM benefit from the impact of non-core and swaps over the medium term given runoff and lower rates. This will be partially offset by the impact of the asset-sensitive core balance sheet, resulting in a medium-term NIM range of 3.25% to 3.4%. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter, featuring stable NIM, strong fee performance led by capital markets and cards, tight expense management and in-line credit performance. We have a series of unique initiatives that are progressing well. Our consumer bank has been transformed. Our commercial bank is exceptionally well positioned and we aim to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. We enjoy a strong capital liquidity and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Given several tailwinds, combined with continued strong execution, we are confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back over to Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Thank you, John. And Alan, let\u2019s open it up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRyan Nash: Hey, good morning Bruce. Good morning, John.\nBruce Van Saun: Good morning.\nJohn Woods: Good morning.\nRyan Nash: Maybe to start off with some of the guidance, you broadly reiterated \u2013 can you maybe just flesh out how some of the expectations have changed, particularly around NII, John? I think you noted you still expect to be in the range. But what are the main drivers to get you there and what would it take to be better than the low end? And just as a follow-up on the margin, you held it flat and it sounds like it could be a little bit better. How have the expectations change relative to the 280 to 285 and the 285 you were expecting at the end of the year? Thank you.\nJohn Woods: Yes, sure. I\u2019ll go and talk through that. I\u2019d say, as you may have heard in some of the opening remarks, we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good. And so we do expect net interest margin to come in a little better, maybe at the high end of that range rather than where we were at the beginning of the year. And a lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can be pinned on the investments we\u2019ve made in the deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition. And when you look at it, deposit levels are better in the first quarter than we expected and interest-bearing deposit costs are a little bit better. So just \u2013 and funding overall, when you look at our borrowing mix has improved significantly. So that\u2019s underpinning a lot of the net interest margin. And when you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet, where you see the front book back book dynamic playing out. It\u2019s very powerful. And so we\u2019re feeling better about NIM trajectory. And I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that that net interest income range, given the confidence around net interest margin. As you get towards the end of the year, as I mentioned, I think, previously, we said our guide would be around 280 to 285 in that range, I\u2019d say we\u2019re probably going to come in at the upper end of that range now when we look out and maybe a tad above, we\u2019ll see as it plays out. And then we\u2019ll see the loan just given where loan demand has started off the year, maybe average loans maybe towards the lower end of that original range. But those offset a couple of basis points of NIM equals about a percentage point on loans. So that math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our guide. What could cause it to come in a little better, continued execution of our strategic initiatives if we see our execution kind of accelerating across the private bank, and our other key initiatives on the deposit side. And let\u2019s see how the second half commercial rebound plays out. We are expecting working capital starting to pick up in the second half. We\u2019re expecting utilization levels to pick up. We\u2019re expecting activity in general, even in the M&A front and M&A finance to be part of the story in the second half. And so if that starts a little earlier or it comes in a little stronger, you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original NII guide.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, I would just add one thing, Brian, it\u2019s Bruce. The fact that the loan demand is a little light is, I think, okay, given there\u2019s a kind of loop to what we\u2019re doing on the deposit side. So we\u2019re not going to chase loan growth. And if, therefore, there\u2019s a little shrinkage in the balance sheet, we can run off our higher cost source of either FHLB funding or broker deposit funding. So we\u2019re taking full advantage of that, which is helping bolster the NIM. The other thing is with less loan growth, you end up freeing more capital. And so that gives us the wherewithal to step up and continue to repurchase stock. And I think our stock is great value here. So we\u2019re all in on that.\nRyan Nash: Got it. And thanks for all the color. And just maybe as a follow-up, just \u2013 any color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on the credit side, which seems to be tracking in-line with your expectations? And maybe specific to office where we saw a jump in the losses this quarter relative to the past few. Maybe just some color on what\u2019s driving that? Was that increased severity? Are you front-loading some losses? And when inevitably do you think we could see the allowance in that portfolio peak. Thank you.\nBruce Van Saun: Let me start and then flip to Don. But I\u2019d say there\u2019s no real surprises here, Ryan. So we can basically see all the office maturities. We\u2019ve got kind of bespoke careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we have, and we\u2019ve been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a win-win situation. So we can come through getting the best return on our loans and borrowers can stay with their properties through a tough environment. And I think that\u2019s all going well. So if you have one quarter where the charge-offs tick up $20 million or the next quarter, they go down $15 million, you\u2019re going to kind of see some modest variation around that line, but basically to use a colloquialism, the pig is going through the python. And it\u2019s going to take a few more quarters for that to fully work its way through. But we\u2019re not seeing any surprises, which is the good thing about this. And so Don, with that, maybe you could pick up.\nDon McCree: No, I think that\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019ve taken our general office from about $4.2 billion to $3.4 billion. So it\u2019s actually coming down nicely, and the charge-offs have actually been modest. The \u2013 most of the charge-offs are where we\u2019re selling out of properties and doing AB loan structures and basically deciding to move on. We\u2019ve had quite a few paydowns also. So it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. But I\u2019d go back to what Bruce said, it\u2019s name by name, property by property. We\u2019ve got our workout teams fully involved. It\u2019s kind of playing out exactly as we expected it to be. If I took myself back 1.5 years ago and looked at the office portfolio, there was a lot of uncertainty. I think there\u2019s a lot more uncertainty now. So remember, I\u2019ve got a huge amount of absorption capacity just in my P&L for any losses that are materializing, and our reserve levels for the portfolio are well above where the severity of losses to date have been. So we feel we feel like we\u2019re going to work through this, as we said, over the next few quarters and begin to peak at the loss levels.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I just \u2013 maybe, John, you can add to this, but in terms of where do we go from here \u2013 you can see that the coverage ratio on office remains high, and it\u2019s gone from 10.2 reserves to 10.6, but that rate of increase is slowing and so we\u2019ve been taking the full charge off through the P&L and holding the reserve at high levels. At some point, we\u2019ll be able to start drawing down on that reserve. I don\u2019t want to make the call on that. But just take note that, that build is starting to slow. And so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s maybe later this year or beginning of next year. But we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves, which will be good for P&L.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I agree with all that, I\u2019d just add a point or two. So what\u2019s built into the 10 you\u2019ll see it in some of our slide materials is an expectation of a 71% decline in property values. And that\u2019s what drives this 10.6% reserve for remaining losses.\nBruce Van Saun: Which is more severe than anything we\u2019ve seen historically, including the great financial recession by a wide margin.\nJohn Woods: Exactly. And I think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us, implies another 6% of losses that we put behind us. So we\u2019ve got 10.6 in the reserve. We\u2019ve charged off about 6. So you\u2019re up over 16% in terms of coverage, we feel pretty good about it, and that\u2019s where we think the losses are going to play out. And as Bruce mentioned, we\u2019ll charge-offs themselves, maybe they peak later this year or early next. But we think we\u2019ve got the reserves covered.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay, next question.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\nScott Siefers: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. John, maybe just a thought on how much longer negative deposit migration continues. I think the prevailing wisdom is it\u2019s slowing, but just curious to hear your updated thoughts on kind of when and why we might trough.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean, we\u2019ve been saying for a while that things have been decelerating. And I\u2019d say our deposit performance this quarter has been \u2013 has been excellent in terms of \u2013 versus what we were expecting coming into the year. So again, deposit levels overall look good. DDA flows and low cost to high cost, migration overall, continuing to decelerate. And I think you can \u2013 we can point to, if you look at where we are, we were at around 21% of DDA at the end of last year at 12/31 and that flattened out. We were at 21% at 03/31. So DDA for us is stabilizing. And the \u2013 however, the low cost to high cost, again, decelerating and as it will continue to decelerate. And what we\u2019ve been indicating is that that\u2019s going to continue until you see the first cut out of the Fed, which is historically what we would expect. But it\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s having a diminishing impact on net interest margin. And so when you elevate overall, the contribution that our deposit franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent. And we\u2019re feeling very good about the trajectory, the DDA stability throughout the rest of \u201824 and getting back to growth because when you think about what\u2019s idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that we\u2019re launching, the private bank non-interest-bearing is accretive to the overall company. We\u2019re at maybe around 30% or more. And so that\u2019s dragging that number up. So I think we have some\u2026\nBruce Van Saun: New York Metro offers another opportunity.\nJohn Woods: And New York Metro as well as a really good point. So the combination of those strategic initiatives, we have some expectation of DDA flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year. And that underpins the net interest margin quite nicely.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. Maybe, Brandon, you can add some color.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. Sure. We\u2019ve been talking for a couple of years now around how \u2013 since so much of our deposit book comes through consumer that we believe that we\u2019ve transformed the book to be pure like or better. And I would just reiterate that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the consumer book with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources, we believe we were number one in our peer set linked order on DDA. So on a relative basis, we still have a lot of confidence that we\u2019re outperforming peers and it\u2019s demonstrating the franchise quality that we\u2019ve built. When you look at the customer level, customer deposits have actually been quite stable around $31,000 per customer. And the remixing of, as John pointed out, is pretty dramatically slowing. And I think that\u2019s kind of indicating that the COVID burn down is beginning to really run its course. So there may be a little bit more, but we feel pretty good that we\u2019re getting kind of the end of that behavioral cycle. We look at overall deposits on an inflation-adjusted basis, they\u2019re back to basically pre COVID. So I think we\u2019re kind of nearing the operating floors here for consumer. Given the strength of low-cost deposits that we have had relative to peers. The other implication is how we\u2019re managing interest-bearing deposits. I do believe that we\u2019ve peaked in the consumer segment in Q1 in our cost of funds. And why do I believe that we had $3 billion in CD rollover in March alone that were priced around 5%. We\u2019ve retained 75% of those as they flipped over and materially lower prices between 3% and 4%. So you start to see the tailwinds building in that you can imagine the cost of funds in the consumer segment potentially beginning to reduce. We\u2019ll see how it plays out where rates are at. But I do believe we\u2019ve sort of peaked here in Q1, and it\u2019s really driven by the strength of our low-cost performance. So we don\u2019t need to chase high interest-bearing costs as a result of that. So I feel really good about where we\u2019re at.\nScott Siefers: Alright, good. Thank you very much for the color.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari: Good morning. One just on additional color on the loan growth commentary, I know you said it could come in throughout the low end of your initial expectation for the year and you have cited weaker line utilization at this point, where \u2013 if you can maybe elaborate a little bit where you see some weakness in what pockets and where do you see some ultimate strengthening there in terms of timing? And then separately, a similar question around your deposit growth expectation, I think for the full year, you had figured out at around up 1% to 2%. Any additional color you can provide and how you\u2019re feeling around that guidance at this point?\nJohn Woods: Yes, I\u2019ll just start off on loans and others can add. But I mean, what we\u2019re seeing is that utilization coming in a little lower in the first quarter and that than was originally expected. But nevertheless, we still see the \u2013 in the second half, the interest around putting some working capital to work and commercial activity starting to pick up is really going to drive the reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the second half. On the retail side of things, we\u2019re still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and HELOC and in the private bank, where we\u2019ve gotten a nice start in terms of \u2013 which is mostly a commercial lending driven amount of activity in the subscription line space. And that we see that picking up. So all in, one it is playing out about as expected, meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans, but we had expected that would be the case. And then the pickup in the second half will be coming out of the commercial business and private bank. Maybe any other color.\nBruce Van Saun: That\u2019s well said, Don, any color.\nDon McCree: Yes. No, I\u2019ll \u2013 I think it\u2019s across the board on the commercial side. And Part of it is due to the booming bond markets. I mean, we\u2019re seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines. And then I think there\u2019s a positive to it also, not for loan levels, but customers are running with lower leverage levels because they\u2019ve been concerned about the economy. We\u2019re seeing a broad, more positive view of the overall economy across really wide swaths of our client base. So that would indicate that they\u2019re going to get more active in things like plant construction, working capital, growth, M&A, and so that should drive some bounce back in the back half of the year.\nBruce Van Saun: Anything from you, Brendan.\nBrendan Coughlin: Yes. The only thing I would add is maybe just strategically that there\u2019s a lot of ins and outs under the cover. So, as we run down auto by essentially $1 billion and other non-court getting replaced with high relationship, high-returning asset growth, whether it\u2019s on the HELOC side or the private bank. So the headline numbers that you see around our loan growth, what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that we\u2019re doing around a handful of areas that have more durable, sticky revenue sources that are going to create more cross-sell around fees and other things over time. So we\u2019re pleased with how that\u2019s going.\nJohn Woods: And then on the \u2013 you had a question about deposits. On the deposit side of things in the first quarter. as I mentioned before, we saw DDA flatten out for the first time in many quarters. So that is really good to see. We also saw low cost flatten out. So overall, we were at 42% last quarter in low cost, we\u2019re at 42% this quarter and low cost plus DDA. So the deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable. And from a quantity level of deposits at the end of the quarter came in higher than expected. That\u2019s driven by just strong execution and our strategic initiatives contributing as we mentioned earlier, New York Metro and Private Bank along with the blocking and tackling that Brendan and Don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise. And so all of those investments are paying off, and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in the second half of \u201824.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes, I would just \u2013 I would highlight that \u2013 just one last quick piece of color is that very pleased to see the Private Bank now has had kind of two quarters with $1 billion-plus of deposit growth and we certainly think that, that\u2019s sustainable and could even accelerate. So the ship has landed, and we\u2019re off to a great start, and we expect that to continue and even accelerate.\nJohn Pancari: Got it. Alright. Thanks, Bruce. And then on the capital front, I did to see the resumption in buybacks, the $300 million in repurchases this quarter. With CET1 here at around 10.6 or 8.9% when you dial in the AACI scenario, how do you look at the likelihood of incremental buybacks from here. In terms of a pace of buybacks, do you think that that could be reasonable given where you\u2019re sitting right now on CET1. Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I think this capital position that we\u2019ve generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility. And when you think about our capital waterfall, I mean our top priority is to put capital to work that is to support customers and clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time. And that\u2019s really what we want to do and that we\u2019re expecting to do. And that\u2019s what capital allows us that flexibility. It also cushions against uncertainties. And so there have been a number \u2013 we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients, but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position. When you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital, we support our dividend, of course, at top of the list. And then if we\u2019re left with elevated capital levels, then we\u2019re able to give it back to shareholders, which we did in the first quarter, we\u2019re planning to do that here in the second quarter. And that flexibility will continue into the second half. So as we monitor loan demand and the macro, that will play into the trajectory of buybacks in the second half.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. And I would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have I\u2019d say, a front-loaded plan this year because there\u2019s less loan growth. In fact, there\u2019s loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around and we start to see loan growth in the second half of the year, that would, by definition, mean we need capital to support the loan growth and there\u2019ll be less capacity for share repurchases. But anyway, we gave the \u2013 you saw the 300 number in the first quarter, John mentioned 200 in the second quarter. And then we\u2019ll see where we get to in the second half. If the loan growth fully doesn\u2019t materialize, we can actually just turn around and keep repurchasing the stock.\nJohn Pancari: Alright. Thanks, Bruce. Appreciate it.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nPeter Winter: Thanks. Good morning. You guys have maintained the net charge-off guidance for the year, but if we assume no rate cuts this year, could it lead to higher net charge-offs than forecasting just given kind of no relief on debt service coverage ratios or loans coming up for renewal at higher rates?\nBruce Van Saun: Well, what I would say on that is the broad credit quality is still very good. So if you look at our C&I book, that\u2019s in really good shape. Companies weathered the pandemic and leaned our business models, locked in lower cost financing. They\u2019re doing more of that now early in the year. So we don\u2019t really see hotspots even with kind of a higher for longer scenario in C&I. Similarly, in consumer, we\u2019re still in very good shape. The consumer is benefiting from still strong liquidity levels, a strong labor market. And so we haven\u2019t seen any adverse migrations in delinquencies or NPAs or anything like that. So that\u2019s the bulk of the loan portfolio. If you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the general office in particular, that\u2019s relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book. And I think there\u2019s potentially some trends. We\u2019re watching the reports that return to office is picking up. And so maybe there\u2019s a little counter trend in office that offsets the kind of additional burden of hire for longer. But I think at the margin, it\u2019s not going to change that charge-off number materially.\nPeter Winter: Got it. And then\u2026\nDon McCree: Peter, I\u2019ll just that from my side. We made no assumptions in our forecast that we\u2019re going to benefit from lower rates. Because we just didn\u2019t know and that\u2019s our credit policy. We don\u2019t go out on the future curve. We run all our scenarios based on where rates are today. So I think you\u2019ve got a peak-ish kind of rate environment. If it lasts another couple of quarters or even another year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make a material difference to the way we forecast charge-offs.\nBrendan Coughlin: The only point I would add on consumer is that our delinquency levels are actually net down year-over-year. Q1 over Q1, led mostly by resi, but we\u2019re seeing really no signs of stress on the book. As Bruce pointed out, so I feel really good and even in a higher for longer that unless there\u2019s a big economic shock that we\u2019re in really good shape.\nPeter Winter: And then just quickly, just a follow-up on office. I guess, I believe that more than half of the maturities on office happened this year. So do you think net charge-offs could peak towards the end of this year, maybe early next year and then start to trend lower?\nDon McCree: I \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to forecast that. I think they will be early next year or late this year probably, but it depends how much we extend, how the negotiations go, how much capital is put into some of these transactions and working through the book loan by loan. It\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have the crystal ball, I say exactly when the peak is. But I\u2019ll go back to what I said before is we\u2019re comfortable how it\u2019s kind of progressing is progressing according to our expectations.\nPeter Winter: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nKen Usdin: Hi. Good morning guys. Just a question on the fee side, it\u2019s really nice to see the capital markets improvement as you would have been thinking as we are seeing more broadly. I am just wondering a couple of line items went well, a couple of items kind of went backward. Just wondering just how you are thinking about the fee progression, the drivers and what\u2019s your pipeline look like relative to the better start point here for the first quarter capital markets. Thanks.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I will start off and Bruce can jump in here. But I mean the drivers \u2013 I mean you look at the big three for us, capital markets, card fees and wealth trust and investment services are all, they are trending well, and we expect to be significant contributors in 2024. So, each of those businesses have had significant strategic investment over the years and even more recently. So, it\u2019s really nice to see that the investments made in the capital markets business come to fruition. We had a good strong quarter in the first quarter, number one in the lead tables on the sponsor side, big rebound from the fourth quarter. And early in the second quarter, the activity \u2013 the pace of activity has continued, and we feel very good about the trends there, not only for 2Q, but for the full year. In the card business, we have made a strategic conversion to Mastercard, and that\u2019s driving a number of positive developments there. And in the wealth business, as you know, all of the advisor hires the Clarfeld acquisition from a number of years ago are all coming together along with the private bank to drive those flows throughout 2024. So, we are feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees.\nBruce Van Saun: I would just say, to your point, Ken, also that there were those three strong areas. And then we had a little bit of weakness in some other areas, service charges, mortgage, the global markets, FX and interest rate lines were a little below our expectations. The good news there is there is nothing structural that we worry about. I think we will see bounce backs over the rest of the year, which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that we will maintain strong fee performance for the year.\nKen Usdin: Okay. Great. And just one more follow-up on the NII and the swaps and just looking at your Pages 25 and 26 from the deck. And it\u2019s pretty clear that you are saying the increases you have made to the swap book are all incorporated in the guidance. So, that first quarter to fourth quarter, $35 million cumulative net interest income impact, is that inclusive of everything that is both like active as of now and then will prospectively still come on as the year progresses?\nJohn Woods: Yes, it is. And so what that is, that $35 million is made up of about $50 million, primarily driven from active swaps that are outstanding. So, there is about $20 billion notional of active swaps outstanding. That grows to about $30 billion by 4Q. That\u2019s incorporated into that number. But then it\u2019s offset by the positive benefit from non-core of about, call it, $17 million or so, or $15 million to $20 million coming from non-core and that gets you to the $35 million drag. But really, when you play it out for the rest of the year, again, broadly, net interest margin trends are coming in a little better, incorporating all of our swap activity, what you see on Page 25 is just the receive-fixed swaps. We actually have pay-fixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this, as well as of course, everything that\u2019s happening in the core balance sheet. So, you got to kind of think at the broadest sense that NIM trends are actually coming in a little better. And then as you get out to later years, you start getting all of this tailwind is really baked in. And you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute. It gets to the point where you get out into 2026 and 2027 that a majority of, a super majority, if you will, of the tailwinds are actually baked in and aren\u2019t rate dependent. But you have that right in terms of the 4Q components that incorporates everything on the receive-fixed swaps side plus non-core.\nKen Usdin: Yes. Okay. And I \u2013 yes, go ahead Bruce.\nBruce Van Saun: And I would just add color there, Ken, is I think coming into the year, people were concerned about that step-up that we had forward starting swaps in Q2 and then more in Q3. The guide that we are giving and our confidence in the NIM outlook incorporate that. So, we are able to absorb that because higher for longer is better for the core balance sheet. We have some pay-fixed swaps we did in the securities book. So, we are able to absorb kind of that step-up in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the NIM outlook for the year.\nKen Usdin: Yes. That\u2019s great, Bruce. And if I can just bring that all together, so you broadly affirmed your broader guidance of down 6 to down 9, and we kind of know the first quarter and have the second quarter outlook. So, what would be the biggest swing factors within that range based on all these points that you are making about the NIM coming in better and now knowing more of this detail about how the swaps will work.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. To me, it\u2019s really volume would be the key to where we land in that range. So, do we actually see that strong growth in the private bank accelerating that could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding, and then the spread that they are making on their loans is also very attractive. So, that\u2019s totally accretive to front book, back book. Do we see the growth in commercial that we expect come in, and I think we \u2013 based on our kind of pipelines and our conversations with our customers and also a feeling that the sponsor community. Right now, there has been a lot of pull forward in refinancing, but I think you are going to start to see some more new money deals in the second half of the year. So, I think that those volume factors will have a big impact. But the way we kind of see it looking out the window today, we are highly confident that those things will materialize. I don\u2019t know, John, if you want to add anything.\nJohn Woods: Yes, I agree with all of that. I would say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand, we still think that range is good. Maybe it comes out at a higher end versus the lower end. But I mean I think that\u2019s a swing factor. All the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well. Our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is underpinning the net interest margin. I would hasten to add that those pay-fixed swaps that we added last quarter in 1Q and also in 4Q, have really driven really nice uptake in the securities yield. You see the securities yields up almost 40 basis points in the first quarter, and that\u2019s offsetting \u2013 that\u2019s a huge component of our balance sheet, and that\u2019s a big driver. And then I should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well where we are seeing front book, back book on the loans side that is in the range of 300 basis points in the first quarter. And you are getting front book back on the securities book of around 200 basis points. So, there are good dynamics in the core balance sheet and all of the swaps were baked in.\nKen Usdin: You said we could come in at the higher end. I think you meant the better end.\nJohn Woods: Yes.\nKen Usdin: Just for everybody\u2019s clarity on that plan. Okay.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I am curious when you talk about kind of this medium-term net interest margin. What are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet? And I guess, specifically, like do you think the overall balance sheet will grow or is there the remixing, Clearly, you are running off the non-core book [ph] on the private bank. But do you envision kind of net balance sheet growth as you look out the next few years? Thank you.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I would say that, we do expect the balance sheet to grow. It\u2019s \u2013 I think we do have a balance sheet optimization program that\u2019s turning over a certain portion of the portfolio. But when you look at the grand total of the initiatives that we are putting in place, I think you see interest-earning assets will be growing in the second half of the year. And as you get out over the medium-term, so I think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow. And that\u2019s our expectation.\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting on the repositioning, and then we start to see the private bank growth in commercial bank as we discussed, start to kick in. So, we should see net growth already in the second half of the year. And then kind of looking out \u201825 to \u201827, we would expect in a strong economy that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates. Again, being selective where we play, focusing on primary relationships and primacy, but there is no reason we couldn\u2019t grow back at nominal GDP the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic, and that plays into math that, the delivery of positive operating leverage, which is part of how you get your return on equity up. And so that\u2019s the model we would like to get back to.\nMatt O\u2019Connor: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Thomas Detry [ph] calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back to capital deployment quickly, you guys were pretty busy in 2023 in terms of strategic actions. Can you update us on how you are thinking about further investment opportunities for the franchise and how you guys prioritize organic growth versus team lift outs or even outright M&A?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. So, I would say that right now, we have a very full plate in terms of the things that we are investing in the organic growth initiatives we have. So, I would not \u2013 we are not really looking much at inorganic situations or opportunities. And so I want to just stay focused on great execution. There is a big pay-off for getting these initiatives right and they are all kind of on the trend line. I would say team lift outs, you mentioned is something that we are hinting at, at this point because while we have the private bank in place, and we have kind of Clarfeld as part of a private wealth complex, we need to scale up our private wealth capabilities to a large extent. And so we are having discussions with teams. And you can watch this space because I think you will start to see us build that part of the business out. But again, it will be prudent. We will treat them like they are kind of M&A transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and they are good cultural fits, but that\u2019s kind of the only thing I would say that we are looking kind of outside. And to some extent, that\u2019s organic. You could argue whether that\u2019s organic or whether it\u2019s acquisition like, but we are kind of using the same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals. I don\u2019t know, Brendan, if you want to put any color on that.\nBrendan Coughlin: Maybe two quick points, one is that I would just say the interest in Citizens from a wealth management perspective is at a high, like we have never seen before. So, we are talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the United States. And so we are going to be very selective. But the interest in what we are doing here is quite unique and distinctive. So, we expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our wealth strategy. But the point around capital that you mentioned, though, just to \u2013 even though we are mentally potentially thinking about the return metrics like we would an M&A deal. Keep in mind that a lift out or what we do with the private bank really is a very de minimis impact on capital. And so that\u2019s why when you look \u2013 when we talk about the breakeven of the private bank being second half of this year, it\u2019s really just eating through the expense guarantees and getting the revenue throughput. So, it has a very de minimis impact on capital. And the same will be true on wealth lift-outs where the teams we bring on board, it will be much more of a expense guarantee mindset and getting them through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you. And then just separately on loan growth. C&I demand has obviously been pretty tepid despite pretty healthy growth in the economy as measured by real GDP, do you think that lack of C&I loan demand is being driven by just general customer caution, or are you guys seeing more competition from non-bank players like the private credit market and others?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I think it\u2019s just a general caution about what\u2019s going to happen in the economy, what\u2019s going to happen with rates. And I think most of our companies have had good years, but they are still expressing caution. So, we are actually not losing business to private credit. It\u2019s interesting. We are actually \u2013 it\u2019s coming the other way because there has been opportunities to take loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank syndicated lending market, refinance those and kind of lock in lower cost financing. So, that\u2019s been a big part of the story here in the first quarter, and it\u2019s continuing into the second quarter. Don?\nDon McCree: I think that\u2019s right. I think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leverage buyout market, which we don\u2019t hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway. So, they are a source of distribution for us. So, we have actually done a couple of deals in the first quarter where we have distributed into the private credit market. So, it doesn\u2019t have a balance sheet impact that it helps drive some of our fee lines.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nDave Rochester: Hey. Good morning guys. Earlier, you mentioned that the flows were a major driving swing factor of that NII guide. I know you mentioned expecting a little less loan growth this year. But you mentioned possibly hitting the better end of that NII range. If for whatever reason, net loan growth doesn\u2019t materialize in the back half and C&I growth only ends up filling in for the run-off that you are expecting? Can you still hit that NII guide for the year?\nBruce Van Saun: Yes. I mean I would say that we are still confident in the range. And so if things break our way, we could be at the better side of that range. If they don\u2019t, we could be at the lower end of that range. So, I would still kind of use that as the guardrails. You would have to have kind of quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range.\nJohn Woods: Yes. Great. And just to reiterate that point, what we have been saying is that we have an expectation that will come in at the better end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that we are seeing and the performance we were able to generate in the first quarter. So, you would see us being at the upper end of that range, maybe a tad better. On net interest margin, that\u2019s offsetting the fact that there is some lighter loan demand that we are also seeing that. You put those together, and we are right down the middle there in terms of that range, and we have got back to the point Bruce just made. And that\u2019s our base case now that we are updating. And there could be puts and takes to that depending upon the volume point that Bruce made earlier.\nDave Rochester: Yes. Perfect. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Your line is now open.\nDavid Konrad: Hey. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this earlier, but just kind of drilling down on the NIM discussion. Just looking at this quarter, curious on C&I yields dropped around 36 bps quarter-over-quarter. I didn\u2019t think this was a heavy swap onboarding this quarter, but just curious where we are looking at that maybe in the next quarter before the swaps come on in the third quarter.\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean really what\u2019s going on, as you have hit it. I would say, just broadly, I would try to make the point that all the swaps are incorporated into the NIM guide. And when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan book, the front book, back book is driving an increase in loan yields ex swaps. So, that\u2019s the first point. As it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint, why there is a negative impact from a swap standpoint, is that there was a mix shift. We had the swap notional didn\u2019t change much, but we had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receives. And that overall \u2013 that net receive rate fell in the quarter, and that\u2019s why you ended up with that negative impact just on that line itself. But again, overall, net interest margin was flat for the quarter. And when you put it all together with all the components, we had quite a strong net interest margin performance even incorporating that swap drag.\nDavid Konrad: Yes, I agree. And then you talked about the securities book both the front book, back book and then the pay floaters coming out. But just curious your outlook for the growth of the securities book going forward?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I mean I think we have gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year. And that\u2019s basically largely done. And so where you see the securities book right now as a percentage of our overall interest earning assets is about where we will be over time. As we grow loans, we will probably grow securities and cash on a similar mix basis from a volume standpoint, but the percentage of cash and securities to overall interest-earning assets at the end of the first quarter is about where we will be for the rest of the year. And I would hasten to add that when you look at that, that\u2019s reflected of our deposit franchise and being primarily consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers. And then if you crank it all through the way the Fed looks at standardized Category 1 banks, our LCR incorporating all of that at 03/31 was 120%, which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint. And that\u2019s played through based upon the balance sheet mix overall, including cash and securities.\nDavid Konrad: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nManan Gosalia: Maybe as a follow-up to the last question, is there any change in how you are thinking through positioning in the medium-term with the expectation for fewer rate cuts coming through? So, with loan growth being a little bit weaker right now, deposit growth being pretty solid, as you noted, are you willing to put on a little bit more duration on the securities side? And separately, has it got cheaper to put in some downside protection on NIM as you look into 2025 and 2026. And is that something you are considering right now?\nJohn Woods: Yes. I would say on the securities side, I would say there is a couple of objectives being addressed, and it\u2019s the interplay between capital and liquidity and interest favors management. So, what we did over the last couple of quarters is we have added $7 billion of pay-fixed swaps that has paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates were likely not to be down, whatever, however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year, five, six, seven cuts, we thought that was probably a little overcooked. And so we put on those pay-fixed swaps in part related to that. But in part related to the multiyear objective to reduce the duration of the securities book given how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint. And so both of those objectives came into play when we shortened the duration of the securities book, which right now is about 3.8 years. We are likely to continue to shorten the duration book of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to 3 years [ph] or thereabouts. And so that\u2019s really the driver there. But you got to look at the overall balance sheet and from an overall balance sheet standpoint, it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And we had at 03/31, we remain an asset-sensitive balance sheet. When it comes to adding downside protection in the out years, we do note that we have a significant drop off of receive-fixed swaps when you get out into 2026 and \u201827. And I think entry points matter. So, if rates continue to stay elevated, and we think there is value there. We want to be careful that we don\u2019t give up our upside that the C&I loan book provides us and we will do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it in. And in general, that would be consistent with something that would be north of 4% of a receive rate out into \u201826 and \u201827, and we will be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to protect the balance sheet over the medium-term.\nManan Gosalia: Got it. Very helpful. And then this morning, one of your peers has suggested that they are seeing corporate behavior shifting from NIB to IB. Are you seeing some of your corporate clients take another look at optimizing their NIB balances in the higher for longer rate environment recently?\nDon McCree: I think it\u2019s pretty much run its course at this point. We have had a little bit of a shift in the book, but it\u2019s really slowed down. I think the clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates. So, I would say our book and our mix is pretty stable right now, and we expect it to stay here.\nJohn Woods: Yes. And I would say overall, you saw our DDA stable at 21% at the end of 1Q, 21% at the end of 4Q. That\u2019s important. That\u2019s the first time this has happened in a while. And so that stability we expect to continue as you get throughout the \u2013 for the rest of the year and actually see growth, as we mentioned earlier, based on other strategic initiatives and the private bank contributing.\nManan Gosalia: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. And with that, I will turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\nBruce Van Saun: Okay. Well, thanks everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support for Citizens. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T event teleconferencing. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Woods",
            "content": "Thanks, Bruce and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the year is off to a good start. First quarter results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment, which supported an improvement in capital markets, stability in our margin and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels either top of our peer group, excellent liquidity and a healthy credit reserve position. Importantly, this positions us to execute well against our multiyear strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our private bank. Let me start with some highlights of our first quarter financial results, referencing slides 3 to 6 before I discuss the details. We generated underlying net income of $395 million for the first quarter and EPS of $0.79. This includes a negative $0.03 impact from the private bank, which is a significant improvement from the $0.11 impact last quarter as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected breakeven in 2H \u201824. It also improved the impact of the non-core portfolio, which contributed a $0.13 negative impact. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it is steadily running off, creating a tailwind for performance going forward. Our notable items this quarter were $0.14, which primarily consists of an adjustment to the FDIC special assessment and TOP and other efficiency-related expenses. Excluding these notable items, our underlying ROCE for the quarter was 10.6%. Playing through defense remains at the top of our priority list, and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6% or 8.9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also continue to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the first quarter. Our pro forma LCR strengthened to 120%, which is well in excess of the large bank category 1 requirement of 100% and our period-end LDR improved to 81% from 82% in the prior quarter. On the funding front, we reduced our period-end FHLB borrowings by about $1.8 billion linked quarter to a modest $2 billion. We also increased our structural funding base with a very successful $1.25 billion senior issuance and another $1.5 billion auto collateralized issuance during the quarter. And we have another $1 billion of auto backed issuance expected to settle this week. This is our fourth issuance, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. In addition, we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward. Credit trends have been performing in line with our expectations, with NCOs coming in at 50 basis points for the first quarter. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is up 2 basis points from year-end. This includes a 10.6% coverage for general office, up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter. We are well positioned for the medium term with expected tailwinds to NIM that support a range of 3.25% to 3.4%. Regarding strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well. We continue to make inroads in the New York Metro and our latest top program is progressing nicely. In addition, we are poised to benefit from an improving capital markets environment with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions positioning us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up. Next, I'll talk through the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 3% linked quarter, reflecting a stable margin on a 2% decrease in average interest-earning assets given lower loan balances and day-count. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was flat at 2.91% as the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the impact of swaps. As expected, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta remains in the low 50s at 52%. And although we continue to see deposit migration, the rate of migration is slowing. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well with our beta generally impact the peers. Moving to Slide 8. Our fees were up 3% linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good card results. The improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in M&A activity and strong bond underwriting results. Our Capital Markets business consistently holds the top 3 middle market sponsor book renter position and this quarter, we achieved the #1 spot. Our deal pipelines remain strong, and we continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter with strong refinancing activity continuing in the bond market. In card, we had a nice increase, primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit cards to Mastercard. Our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter with lower activity in commodities and FX. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and a modest decline in servicing P&L, partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved while lot volumes were stable. On Slide 9, we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses, which were stable. We will continue to execute on our TOP program, which gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives. On Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 2% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans, given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand, our highly selective approach to lending in this environment, along with exits of lower returning credit-only relationships. Commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity was limited in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well in deposits. Year-on-year period-end deposits were up $4.2 billion driven by growth in retail and the private bank. Period end deposits were down slightly linked quarter given expected seasonal impacts in commercial largely offset by growth in the private bank and retail branch deposits. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were well controlled, up 6 basis points, which translates to a 52% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 68% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories continue to moderate. And with the contribution of attractive deposits from the private bank, non-interest-bearing deposits are holding steady at about 21% of total deposits. Moving on to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 50 basis points, up 4 basis points linked quarter. This includes increased commercial charge-offs related to pre general office, which were in line with our expectations. In retail, we saw a modest seasonal improvement. Non-accrual loans increased 8% linked quarter driven by general office. The continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail, while other retail categories were stable. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the fourth quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization. The reserve for the $3.4 billion general office portfolio represents 10.6% coverage, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6% and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 8.9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers, and you can see on Slide 16, where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter. Given our strong capital position, we resumed common share repurchases and including dividends, we returned a total of $497 million to shareholders in the first quarter. On the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank. First, on Slide 17, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise, a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationship-based lending and a meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress taking deposit share with retail deposits up 20% year-on-year as we continue building our customer base in New York Metro. Slide 18. Let me update you on our progress in building a premier private bank, taking the opportunity to fill the void left in the wake of the bank failures last year. Our build net is going very well and gaining momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $2.4 billion of attractive deposits with roughly 30% non-interest-bearing. Also, we are now at just over $1 billion of loans and $0.5 billion of investments and continuing to grow. We just opened our newest private banking office in Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Clarfeld Wealth Management business as the centerpiece of that effort. Next, on Slide 19, we have built a formidable full-service commercial bank, which consistently punches above its weight. Our multiyear investments in talent, capabilities and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to provide life cycle services to middle market, mid-corporate and sponsor clients in high-growth sectors of the U.S. economy. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem. As evidenced by our consistent standing at the top of the sponsored lead tables, we are well positioned to take advantage of a more constructive capital markets environment and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions coming through in our results this quarter. Moving to Slide 20, we provide the guidance for the second quarter. We expect NII to decrease about 2%. Non-interest income should be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect non-interest expense to be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs are expected to be about 50 basis points and the ACL should continue to benefit from the non-core runoff. Our CET1 is expected to come in at about 10.5% with approximately $200 million of share repurchases currently planned. We are broadly reaffirming our full year 2024 guide. We expect NII to land within the range of down 6% to 9%, consistent with our January guidance, with margin coming in a little better than expected, offsetting the impact of lower loan demand. The other components of PPNR are also tracking to our January guidance. In addition, NCOs are trending in line with our expectations of approximately 50 basis points for the year. Our target CET1 ratio for 2024 is approximately 10.5%, and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. Given the changing rate outlook, I wanted to update you on how the swaps and our non-core portfolio are expected to impact NII and NIM as we look out further in 2024 and beyond. We've included Slide 25 in the appendix, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. By 4Q 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. Looking out further, we expect a significant NII tailwind and NIM benefit from the impact of non-core and swaps over the medium term given runoff and lower rates. This will be partially offset by the impact of the asset-sensitive core balance sheet, resulting in a medium-term NIM range of 3.25% to 3.4%. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter, featuring stable NIM, strong fee performance led by capital markets and cards, tight expense management and in-line credit performance. We have a series of unique initiatives that are progressing well. Our consumer bank has been transformed. Our commercial bank is exceptionally well positioned and we aim to build the premier bank-owned private bank and wealth franchise. We enjoy a strong capital liquidity and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Given several tailwinds, combined with continued strong execution, we are confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce. Good morning. Yes, sure. I'll go and talk through that. I'd say, as you may have heard in some of the opening remarks, we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good. And so we do expect net interest margin to come in a little better, maybe at the high end of that range rather than where we were at the beginning of the year. And a lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can be pinned on the investments we've made in the deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition. And when you look at it, deposit levels are better in the first quarter than we expected and interest-bearing deposit costs are a little bit better. So just \u2013 and funding overall, when you look at our borrowing mix has improved significantly. So that's underpinning a lot of the net interest margin. And when you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet, where you see the front book back book dynamic playing out. It's very powerful. And so we're feeling better about NIM trajectory. And I think that's what you're seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that that net interest income range, given the confidence around net interest margin. As you get towards the end of the year, as I mentioned, I think, previously, we said our guide would be around 280 to 285 in that range, I'd say we're probably going to come in at the upper end of that range now when we look out and maybe a tad above, we'll see as it plays out. And then we'll see the loan just given where loan demand has started off the year, maybe average loans maybe towards the lower end of that original range. But those offset a couple of basis points of NIM equals about a percentage point on loans. So that math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our guide. What could cause it to come in a little better, continued execution of our strategic initiatives if we see our execution kind of accelerating across the private bank, and our other key initiatives on the deposit side. And let's see how the second half commercial rebound plays out. We are expecting working capital starting to pick up in the second half. We're expecting utilization levels to pick up. We're expecting activity in general, even in the M&A front and M&A finance to be part of the story in the second half. And so if that starts a little earlier or it comes in a little stronger, you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original NII guide. Yes, I agree with all that, I'd just add a point or two. So what's built into the 10 you'll see it in some of our slide materials is an expectation of a 71% decline in property values. And that's what drives this 10.6% reserve for remaining losses. Exactly. And I think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us, implies another 6% of losses that we put behind us. So we've got 10.6 in the reserve. We've charged off about 6. So you're up over 16% in terms of coverage, we feel pretty good about it, and that's where we think the losses are going to play out. And as Bruce mentioned, we'll charge-offs themselves, maybe they peak later this year or early next. But we think we've got the reserves covered. Yes. I mean, we've been saying for a while that things have been decelerating. And I'd say our deposit performance this quarter has been \u2013 has been excellent in terms of \u2013 versus what we were expecting coming into the year. So again, deposit levels overall look good. DDA flows and low cost to high cost, migration overall, continuing to decelerate. And I think you can \u2013 we can point to, if you look at where we are, we were at around 21% of DDA at the end of last year at 12/31 and that flattened out. We were at 21% at 03/31. So DDA for us is stabilizing. And the \u2013 however, the low cost to high cost, again, decelerating and as it will continue to decelerate. And what we've been indicating is that that's going to continue until you see the first cut out of the Fed, which is historically what we would expect. But it's getting to the point where it's having a diminishing impact on net interest margin. And so when you elevate overall, the contribution that our deposit franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent. And we're feeling very good about the trajectory, the DDA stability throughout the rest of \u201824 and getting back to growth because when you think about what's idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that we're launching, the private bank non-interest-bearing is accretive to the overall company. We're at maybe around 30% or more. And so that's dragging that number up. So I think we have some... And New York Metro as well as a really good point. So the combination of those strategic initiatives, we have some expectation of DDA flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year. And that underpins the net interest margin quite nicely. Yes, I'll just start off on loans and others can add. But I mean, what we're seeing is that utilization coming in a little lower in the first quarter and that than was originally expected. But nevertheless, we still see the \u2013 in the second half, the interest around putting some working capital to work and commercial activity starting to pick up is really going to drive the reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the second half. On the retail side of things, we're still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and HELOC and in the private bank, where we've gotten a nice start in terms of \u2013 which is mostly a commercial lending driven amount of activity in the subscription line space. And that we see that picking up. So all in, one it is playing out about as expected, meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans, but we had expected that would be the case. And then the pickup in the second half will be coming out of the commercial business and private bank. Maybe any other color. And then on the \u2013 you had a question about deposits. On the deposit side of things in the first quarter. as I mentioned before, we saw DDA flatten out for the first time in many quarters. So that is really good to see. We also saw low cost flatten out. So overall, we were at 42% last quarter in low cost, we're at 42% this quarter and low cost plus DDA. So the deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable. And from a quantity level of deposits at the end of the quarter came in higher than expected. That's driven by just strong execution and our strategic initiatives contributing as we mentioned earlier, New York Metro and Private Bank along with the blocking and tackling that Brendan and Don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise. And so all of those investments are paying off, and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in the second half of \u201824. Yes. I think this capital position that we've generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility. And when you think about our capital waterfall, I mean our top priority is to put capital to work that is to support customers and clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time. And that's really what we want to do and that we're expecting to do. And that's what capital allows us that flexibility. It also cushions against uncertainties. And so there have been a number \u2013 we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients, but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position. When you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital, we support our dividend, of course, at top of the list. And then if we're left with elevated capital levels, then we're able to give it back to shareholders, which we did in the first quarter, we're planning to do that here in the second quarter. And that flexibility will continue into the second half. So as we monitor loan demand and the macro, that will play into the trajectory of buybacks in the second half. Yes, I will start off and Bruce can jump in here. But I mean the drivers \u2013 I mean you look at the big three for us, capital markets, card fees and wealth trust and investment services are all, they are trending well, and we expect to be significant contributors in 2024. So, each of those businesses have had significant strategic investment over the years and even more recently. So, it's really nice to see that the investments made in the capital markets business come to fruition. We had a good strong quarter in the first quarter, number one in the lead tables on the sponsor side, big rebound from the fourth quarter. And early in the second quarter, the activity \u2013 the pace of activity has continued, and we feel very good about the trends there, not only for 2Q, but for the full year. In the card business, we have made a strategic conversion to Mastercard, and that's driving a number of positive developments there. And in the wealth business, as you know, all of the advisor hires the Clarfeld acquisition from a number of years ago are all coming together along with the private bank to drive those flows throughout 2024. So, we are feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees. Yes, it is. And so what that is, that $35 million is made up of about $50 million, primarily driven from active swaps that are outstanding. So, there is about $20 billion notional of active swaps outstanding. That grows to about $30 billion by 4Q. That's incorporated into that number. But then it's offset by the positive benefit from non-core of about, call it, $17 million or so, or $15 million to $20 million coming from non-core and that gets you to the $35 million drag. But really, when you play it out for the rest of the year, again, broadly, net interest margin trends are coming in a little better, incorporating all of our swap activity, what you see on Page 25 is just the receive-fixed swaps. We actually have pay-fixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this, as well as of course, everything that's happening in the core balance sheet. So, you got to kind of think at the broadest sense that NIM trends are actually coming in a little better. And then as you get out to later years, you start getting all of this tailwind is really baked in. And you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute. It gets to the point where you get out into 2026 and 2027 that a majority of, a super majority, if you will, of the tailwinds are actually baked in and aren't rate dependent. But you have that right in terms of the 4Q components that incorporates everything on the receive-fixed swaps side plus non-core. Yes, I agree with all of that. I would say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand, we still think that range is good. Maybe it comes out at a higher end versus the lower end. But I mean I think that's a swing factor. All the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well. Our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is underpinning the net interest margin. I would hasten to add that those pay-fixed swaps that we added last quarter in 1Q and also in 4Q, have really driven really nice uptake in the securities yield. You see the securities yields up almost 40 basis points in the first quarter, and that's offsetting \u2013 that's a huge component of our balance sheet, and that's a big driver. And then I should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well where we are seeing front book, back book on the loans side that is in the range of 300 basis points in the first quarter. And you are getting front book back on the securities book of around 200 basis points. So, there are good dynamics in the core balance sheet and all of the swaps were baked in. Yes. Yes. I would say that, we do expect the balance sheet to grow. It's \u2013 I think we do have a balance sheet optimization program that's turning over a certain portion of the portfolio. But when you look at the grand total of the initiatives that we are putting in place, I think you see interest-earning assets will be growing in the second half of the year. And as you get out over the medium-term, so I think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow. And that's our expectation. Yes. Great. And just to reiterate that point, what we have been saying is that we have an expectation that will come in at the better end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that we are seeing and the performance we were able to generate in the first quarter. So, you would see us being at the upper end of that range, maybe a tad better. On net interest margin, that's offsetting the fact that there is some lighter loan demand that we are also seeing that. You put those together, and we are right down the middle there in terms of that range, and we have got back to the point Bruce just made. And that's our base case now that we are updating. And there could be puts and takes to that depending upon the volume point that Bruce made earlier. Yes. I mean really what's going on, as you have hit it. I would say, just broadly, I would try to make the point that all the swaps are incorporated into the NIM guide. And when you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan book, the front book, back book is driving an increase in loan yields ex swaps. So, that's the first point. As it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint, why there is a negative impact from a swap standpoint, is that there was a mix shift. We had the swap notional didn't change much, but we had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receives. And that overall \u2013 that net receive rate fell in the quarter, and that's why you ended up with that negative impact just on that line itself. But again, overall, net interest margin was flat for the quarter. And when you put it all together with all the components, we had quite a strong net interest margin performance even incorporating that swap drag. Yes. I mean I think we have gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year. And that's basically largely done. And so where you see the securities book right now as a percentage of our overall interest earning assets is about where we will be over time. As we grow loans, we will probably grow securities and cash on a similar mix basis from a volume standpoint, but the percentage of cash and securities to overall interest-earning assets at the end of the first quarter is about where we will be for the rest of the year. And I would hasten to add that when you look at that, that's reflected of our deposit franchise and being primarily consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers. And then if you crank it all through the way the Fed looks at standardized Category 1 banks, our LCR incorporating all of that at 03/31 was 120%, which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint. And that's played through based upon the balance sheet mix overall, including cash and securities. Yes. I would say on the securities side, I would say there is a couple of objectives being addressed, and it's the interplay between capital and liquidity and interest favors management. So, what we did over the last couple of quarters is we have added $7 billion of pay-fixed swaps that has paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates were likely not to be down, whatever, however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year, five, six, seven cuts, we thought that was probably a little overcooked. And so we put on those pay-fixed swaps in part related to that. But in part related to the multiyear objective to reduce the duration of the securities book given how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint. And so both of those objectives came into play when we shortened the duration of the securities book, which right now is about 3.8 years. We are likely to continue to shorten the duration book of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to 3 years [ph] or thereabouts. And so that's really the driver there. But you got to look at the overall balance sheet and from an overall balance sheet standpoint, it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And we had at 03/31, we remain an asset-sensitive balance sheet. When it comes to adding downside protection in the out years, we do note that we have a significant drop off of receive-fixed swaps when you get out into 2026 and \u201827. And I think entry points matter. So, if rates continue to stay elevated, and we think there is value there. We want to be careful that we don't give up our upside that the C&I loan book provides us and we will do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it in. And in general, that would be consistent with something that would be north of 4% of a receive rate out into \u201826 and \u201827, and we will be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to protect the balance sheet over the medium-term. Yes. And I would say overall, you saw our DDA stable at 21% at the end of 1Q, 21% at the end of 4Q. That's important. That's the first time this has happened in a while. And so that stability we expect to continue as you get throughout the \u2013 for the rest of the year and actually see growth, as we mentioned earlier, based on other strategic initiatives and the private bank contributing."

            "content": "No, I think that's exactly right. We've taken our general office from about $4.2 billion to $3.4 billion. So it's actually coming down nicely, and the charge-offs have actually been modest. The \u2013 most of the charge-offs are where we're selling out of properties and doing AB loan structures and basically deciding to move on. We've had quite a few paydowns also. So it's not all doom and gloom. But I'd go back to what Bruce said, it's name by name, property by property. We've got our workout teams fully involved. It's kind of playing out exactly as we expected it to be. If I took myself back 1.5 years ago and looked at the office portfolio, there was a lot of uncertainty. I think there's a lot more uncertainty now. So remember, I've got a huge amount of absorption capacity just in my P&L for any losses that are materializing, and our reserve levels for the portfolio are well above where the severity of losses to date have been. So we feel we feel like we're going to work through this, as we said, over the next few quarters and begin to peak at the loss levels. Yes. No, I'll \u2013 I think it's across the board on the commercial side. And Part of it is due to the booming bond markets. I mean, we're seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines. And then I think there's a positive to it also, not for loan levels, but customers are running with lower leverage levels because they've been concerned about the economy. We're seeing a broad, more positive view of the overall economy across really wide swaths of our client base. So that would indicate that they're going to get more active in things like plant construction, working capital, growth, M&A, and so that should drive some bounce back in the back half of the year. Peter, I'll just that from my side. We made no assumptions in our forecast that we're going to benefit from lower rates. Because we just didn't know and that's our credit policy. We don't go out on the future curve. We run all our scenarios based on where rates are today. So I think you've got a peak-ish kind of rate environment. If it lasts another couple of quarters or even another year, I don't think it's going to make a material difference to the way we forecast charge-offs. I \u2013 it's really hard to forecast that. I think they will be early next year or late this year probably, but it depends how much we extend, how the negotiations go, how much capital is put into some of these transactions and working through the book loan by loan. It's \u2013 I don't have the crystal ball, I say exactly when the peak is. But I'll go back to what I said before is we're comfortable how it's kind of progressing is progressing according to our expectations. I think that's right. I think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leverage buyout market, which we don't hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway. So, they are a source of distribution for us. So, we have actually done a couple of deals in the first quarter where we have distributed into the private credit market. So, it doesn't have a balance sheet impact that it helps drive some of our fee lines. I think it's pretty much run its course at this point. We have had a little bit of a shift in the book, but it's really slowed down. I think the clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates. So, I would say our book and our mix is pretty stable right now, and we expect it to stay here."

We continue to play strong defense through an uncertain environment with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, our LDR at 81%, our allowance for loan loss ratio of 161%, and general office reserves now at 10.6%. On the P&L, we are still seeing a modest decline in NII though our NIM was stable at 2.91%. Fees picked up by 3% sequential quarter, led by capital markets and card and expenses were flat. Our credit trends are in line with expectations. We repurchased $300 million of shares during the quarter as we free up capital from our non-core rundown. Our guide for Q2 and full year remain consistent with our expectations at the outset of the year. Our strategic initiatives are making good progress. The Private Bank is off to a good start, reaching $2.4 billion in deposits at quarter end. We expect momentum to accelerate further over the course of the year. We are also focused on building out private wealth management through further investment in Clarfeld plus several imminent team lift-outs. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to go well with the fastest growth of any of our regions and really strong net promoter scores. Our focus in the commercial bank of serving the middle-market, private capital and key growth verticals has put us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity, which we expect to build further over the course of the year. And our TOP 9 program is being executed well, allowing us to self-fund our growth investments while keeping overall expense growth rate muted. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium term. Over the past decade, we have undertaken a major transformation of Citizens. Our Consumer and Commercial Banking segments are positioned for success, and we are now looking to build the premier bank owned private bank and wealth franchise. Our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital liquidity and funding profile and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. Our expense base has been tightly managed with AI offering the potential for further breakthroughs. Lots accomplished with more to do, clearly, exciting times for Citizens. With that, let me turn it over to John. Okay. Thank you, John. And Alan, let's open it up for Q&A. Good morning. Yes, I would just add one thing, Brian, it's Bruce. The fact that the loan demand is a little light is, I think, okay, given there's a kind of loop to what we're doing on the deposit side. So we're not going to chase loan growth. And if, therefore, there's a little shrinkage in the balance sheet, we can run off our higher cost source of either FHLB funding or broker deposit funding. So we're taking full advantage of that, which is helping bolster the NIM. The other thing is with less loan growth, you end up freeing more capital. And so that gives us the wherewithal to step up and continue to repurchase stock. And I think our stock is great value here. So we're all in on that. Let me start and then flip to Don. But I'd say there's no real surprises here, Ryan. So we can basically see all the office maturities. We've got kind of bespoke careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we have, and we've been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a win-win situation. So we can come through getting the best return on our loans and borrowers can stay with their properties through a tough environment. And I think that's all going well. So if you have one quarter where the charge-offs tick up $20 million or the next quarter, they go down $15 million, you're going to kind of see some modest variation around that line, but basically to use a colloquialism, the pig is going through the python. And it's going to take a few more quarters for that to fully work its way through. But we're not seeing any surprises, which is the good thing about this. And so Don, with that, maybe you could pick up. Yes. And I just \u2013 maybe, John, you can add to this, but in terms of where do we go from here \u2013 you can see that the coverage ratio on office remains high, and it's gone from 10.2 reserves to 10.6, but that rate of increase is slowing and so we've been taking the full charge off through the P&L and holding the reserve at high levels. At some point, we'll be able to start drawing down on that reserve. I don't want to make the call on that. But just take note that, that build is starting to slow. And so I don't know if it's maybe later this year or beginning of next year. But we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves, which will be good for P&L. Which is more severe than anything we've seen historically, including the great financial recession by a wide margin. Okay, next question. New York Metro offers another opportunity. Yes. Maybe, Brandon, you can add some color. That's well said, Don, any color. Anything from you, Brendan. Yes, I would just \u2013 I would highlight that \u2013 just one last quick piece of color is that very pleased to see the Private Bank now has had kind of two quarters with $1 billion-plus of deposit growth and we certainly think that, that's sustainable and could even accelerate. So the ship has landed, and we're off to a great start, and we expect that to continue and even accelerate. Yes. And I would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have I'd say, a front-loaded plan this year because there's less loan growth. In fact, there's loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around and we start to see loan growth in the second half of the year, that would, by definition, mean we need capital to support the loan growth and there'll be less capacity for share repurchases. But anyway, we gave the \u2013 you saw the 300 number in the first quarter, John mentioned 200 in the second quarter. And then we'll see where we get to in the second half. If the loan growth fully doesn't materialize, we can actually just turn around and keep repurchasing the stock. Okay, thanks. Well, what I would say on that is the broad credit quality is still very good. So if you look at our C&I book, that's in really good shape. Companies weathered the pandemic and leaned our business models, locked in lower cost financing. They're doing more of that now early in the year. So we don't really see hotspots even with kind of a higher for longer scenario in C&I. Similarly, in consumer, we're still in very good shape. The consumer is benefiting from still strong liquidity levels, a strong labor market. And so we haven't seen any adverse migrations in delinquencies or NPAs or anything like that. So that's the bulk of the loan portfolio. If you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the general office in particular, that's relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book. And I think there's potentially some trends. We're watching the reports that return to office is picking up. And so maybe there's a little counter trend in office that offsets the kind of additional burden of hire for longer. But I think at the margin, it's not going to change that charge-off number materially. I would just say, to your point, Ken, also that there were those three strong areas. And then we had a little bit of weakness in some other areas, service charges, mortgage, the global markets, FX and interest rate lines were a little below our expectations. The good news there is there is nothing structural that we worry about. I think we will see bounce backs over the rest of the year, which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that we will maintain strong fee performance for the year. And I would just add color there, Ken, is I think coming into the year, people were concerned about that step-up that we had forward starting swaps in Q2 and then more in Q3. The guide that we are giving and our confidence in the NIM outlook incorporate that. So, we are able to absorb that because higher for longer is better for the core balance sheet. We have some pay-fixed swaps we did in the securities book. So, we are able to absorb kind of that step-up in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the NIM outlook for the year. Yes. To me, it's really volume would be the key to where we land in that range. So, do we actually see that strong growth in the private bank accelerating that could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding, and then the spread that they are making on their loans is also very attractive. So, that's totally accretive to front book, back book. Do we see the growth in commercial that we expect come in, and I think we \u2013 based on our kind of pipelines and our conversations with our customers and also a feeling that the sponsor community. Right now, there has been a lot of pull forward in refinancing, but I think you are going to start to see some more new money deals in the second half of the year. So, I think that those volume factors will have a big impact. But the way we kind of see it looking out the window today, we are highly confident that those things will materialize. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything. Yes. I would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting on the repositioning, and then we start to see the private bank growth in commercial bank as we discussed, start to kick in. So, we should see net growth already in the second half of the year. And then kind of looking out \u201825 to \u201827, we would expect in a strong economy that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates. Again, being selective where we play, focusing on primary relationships and primacy, but there is no reason we couldn't grow back at nominal GDP the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic, and that plays into math that, the delivery of positive operating leverage, which is part of how you get your return on equity up. And so that's the model we would like to get back to. Yes. So, I would say that right now, we have a very full plate in terms of the things that we are investing in the organic growth initiatives we have. So, I would not \u2013 we are not really looking much at inorganic situations or opportunities. And so I want to just stay focused on great execution. There is a big pay-off for getting these initiatives right and they are all kind of on the trend line. I would say team lift outs, you mentioned is something that we are hinting at, at this point because while we have the private bank in place, and we have kind of Clarfeld as part of a private wealth complex, we need to scale up our private wealth capabilities to a large extent. And so we are having discussions with teams. And you can watch this space because I think you will start to see us build that part of the business out. But again, it will be prudent. We will treat them like they are kind of M&A transactions that are accretive and they fit our strategy and they are good cultural fits, but that's kind of the only thing I would say that we are looking kind of outside. And to some extent, that's organic. You could argue whether that's organic or whether it's acquisition like, but we are kind of using the same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to put any color on that. Yes. I think it's just a general caution about what's going to happen in the economy, what's going to happen with rates. And I think most of our companies have had good years, but they are still expressing caution. So, we are actually not losing business to private credit. It's interesting. We are actually \u2013 it's coming the other way because there has been opportunities to take loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank syndicated lending market, refinance those and kind of lock in lower cost financing. So, that's been a big part of the story here in the first quarter, and it's continuing into the second quarter. Don? Yes. I mean I would say that we are still confident in the range. And so if things break our way, we could be at the better side of that range. If they don't, we could be at the lower end of that range. So, I would still kind of use that as the guardrails. You would have to have kind of quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range. Okay. Well, thanks everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support for Citizens. Have a great day."

            "name": "Brendan Coughlin",
            "content": "Yes. Sure. We've been talking for a couple of years now around how \u2013 since so much of our deposit book comes through consumer that we believe that we've transformed the book to be pure like or better. And I would just reiterate that, that's what we're seeing. We were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the consumer book with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources, we believe we were number one in our peer set linked order on DDA. So on a relative basis, we still have a lot of confidence that we're outperforming peers and it's demonstrating the franchise quality that we've built. When you look at the customer level, customer deposits have actually been quite stable around $31,000 per customer. And the remixing of, as John pointed out, is pretty dramatically slowing. And I think that's kind of indicating that the COVID burn down is beginning to really run its course. So there may be a little bit more, but we feel pretty good that we're getting kind of the end of that behavioral cycle. We look at overall deposits on an inflation-adjusted basis, they're back to basically pre COVID. So I think we're kind of nearing the operating floors here for consumer. Given the strength of low-cost deposits that we have had relative to peers. The other implication is how we're managing interest-bearing deposits. I do believe that we've peaked in the consumer segment in Q1 in our cost of funds. And why do I believe that we had $3 billion in CD rollover in March alone that were priced around 5%. We've retained 75% of those as they flipped over and materially lower prices between 3% and 4%. So you start to see the tailwinds building in that you can imagine the cost of funds in the consumer segment potentially beginning to reduce. We'll see how it plays out where rates are at. But I do believe we've sort of peaked here in Q1, and it's really driven by the strength of our low-cost performance. So we don't need to chase high interest-bearing costs as a result of that. So I feel really good about where we're at. Yes. The only thing I would add is maybe just strategically that there's a lot of ins and outs under the cover. So, as we run down auto by essentially $1 billion and other non-court getting replaced with high relationship, high-returning asset growth, whether it's on the HELOC side or the private bank. So the headline numbers that you see around our loan growth, what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that we're doing around a handful of areas that have more durable, sticky revenue sources that are going to create more cross-sell around fees and other things over time. So we're pleased with how that's going. The only point I would add on consumer is that our delinquency levels are actually net down year-over-year. Q1 over Q1, led mostly by resi, but we're seeing really no signs of stress on the book. As Bruce pointed out, so I feel really good and even in a higher for longer that unless there's a big economic shock that we're in really good shape. Maybe two quick points, one is that I would just say the interest in Citizens from a wealth management perspective is at a high, like we have never seen before. So, we are talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the United States. And so we are going to be very selective. But the interest in what we are doing here is quite unique and distinctive. So, we expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our wealth strategy. But the point around capital that you mentioned, though, just to \u2013 even though we are mentally potentially thinking about the return metrics like we would an M&A deal. Keep in mind that a lift out or what we do with the private bank really is a very de minimis impact on capital. And so that's why when you look \u2013 when we talk about the breakeven of the private bank being second half of this year, it's really just eating through the expense guarantees and getting the revenue throughput. So, it has a very de minimis impact on capital. And the same will be true on wealth lift-outs where the teams we bring on board, it will be much more of a expense guarantee mindset and getting them through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital."
